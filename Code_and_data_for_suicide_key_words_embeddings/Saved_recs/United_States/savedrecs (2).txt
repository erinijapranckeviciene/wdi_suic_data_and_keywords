AB Introduction
   We aimed to investigate the association of non-daily smoking with depressive symptoms and suicidal behaviours among adolescents by analysing data from the 2016 Korean Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey (KYRBWS), a national school-based survey.
   Methods
   We analysed data from a nationally representative sample of Korean adolescents aged 1218 years (n = 65,528). We investigated the risks of depressive symptoms, suicide ideation, plan and attempt in adolescent non-daily smokers using multiple logistic regression analyses after adjusting for confounding factors. Taking into account the trajectory of smoking patterns in adolescents, we assessed all analyses with stratification by early (aged 12-15) and late (aged 16-18) adolescents.
   Results
   Among early adolescents, non-daily smokers were more likely to have depressive symptoms, suicide ideation and plan compared with never smokers and even more likely to have depressive symptoms compared with daily smokers. Among late adolescents, non-daily smokers had higher risks of depressive symptoms, suicide ideation, plan and attempt than never smokers, whereas the risk for suicide attempts was lower than daily smokers.
   Conclusions
   Our findings suggest that non-daily smoking in adolescents was associated with risks for depressive symptoms and suicidal behaviours, and the association was more prominent in early adolescents. Careful attention on the mental health of adolescent non-daily smokers is needed because this is an increasing and easily overlooked group.

AB Context: Pharmaceutical drug poisonings, especially those that are intentional, are a serious problem for adolescents and young adults. Poison control center data is a viable tool to track intentional drug poisonings in near real-time.Objective: To determine intentional drug poisoning rates among adolescents and young adults in Ohio using poison control center data.Methods: We analyzed data from 2002 to 2014 obtained by Ohio's three poison control centers. Inclusion variables were calls made to the centers that had appropriate subject age (10-29 years old), subject sex, involved substance (all drug classes), and medical outcome (no effect, minor effect, moderate effect, major effect, and death). Intentional drug poisoning reports were also separated into subgroups to compare suspected suicide reports to misuse and abuse reports. Finally, resident population estimates were used to generate 2014 intentional drug poisoning rates for each county in Ohio.Results: The most common age group for intentional drug poisonings was 18-24. Females reported more suspected suicide drug poisonings while males reported more misuse/abuse drug poisonings. The most reported drug class across all ages was analgesics. Of the 88 counties in Ohio, Hamilton, Williams, Washington, and Guernsey counties had the highest rates of intentional drug poisonings.Conclusions: The high report rate of suspected suicides and analgesic class drugs demonstrates the need for preventative measures for adolescents and young adults in Ohio. Any interventions, along with legislative changes, will need to take place in our local communities.

AB Background: Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the US, and rates of suicide are higher in rural than urban areas. As proposed by the Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide, thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness are risk factors for suicidal behavior, although protective individual-level characteristics such as forgiveness, may indirectly affect suicidal behavior by decreasing the deleterious effect of thwarted interpersonal needs.
   Method: A sample of uninsured adults recruited from a rural primary clinic (N=101) completed the Brief Multidimensional Measure of Religiousness and Spirituality; Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised; Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire; and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Parallel and serial multivariable mediation analyses were conducted to test for direct and indirect effects of forgiveness on suicidal behavior.
   Results: In parallel mediation, covarying depressive symptoms, forgiveness of self had an indirect effect on suicidal behavior, through perceived burdensomeness. Inclusion of depressive symptoms as a mediator revealed an indirect effect of forgiveness of self and others on suicidal behavior via depression, thwarted belongingness, and perceived burdensomeness in a serial mediation model.
   Limitation: A longitudinal study, with an equal representation of males and diverse populations is needed to replicate our findings.
   Discussion: Our findings have implications for the role health providers can play in addressing suicide with rural patients. Promoting forgiveness, may, in turn affect interpersonal functioning and decrease risk for suicidal behavior. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rates of suicide are elevated among veterinary surgeons in several countries, yet little is known about contributory factors. We have conducted a systematic review of studies investigating suicidal behaviour and psychosocial problems in veterinary surgeons.
   A systematic search of the international research literature was performed in May 2008. Data from 52 studies of non-fatal suicidal behaviour, mental health difficulties, stress and burnout, occupational difficulties, and psychological characteristics of veterinary surgeons were extracted by two independent reviewers and analysed. Studies were rated for quality and greater emphasis placed on findings from higher quality studies.
   The majority of studies were of stress and occupational difficulties experienced by veterinary surgeons. Occupational stressors included managerial aspects of the job, long working hours, heavy workload, poor work-life balance, difficult client relations, and performing euthanasia. Few studies investigated suicidal behaviour or mental health difficulties in the profession. Some studies suggested that young and female veterinarians are at greatest risk of negative outcomes such as suicidal thoughts, mental health difficulties, and job dissatisfaction.
   The review highlights the difficulties faced by veterinary surgeons that may contribute to poor mental wellbeing and suicidal behaviour. Future research might include further examination of the influence of euthanasia on attitudes towards suicide and more direct examination of the impact that occupational risk factors might have on suicidal behaviour. Suggestions about the review's implications for suicide prevention in this group are also made.

ID NATIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGIC SURVEY; INTERVIEW SCHEDULE AUDADIS; DRUG MODULES;

   ASSOCIATION; RELIABILITY
AB Background: Suicide and alcohol use disorders (AUD) have high public health and economic costs. We investigate the relationship between religious features that are external to the individual (hereafter, contextual religiosity) and individuals' risk of AUD and suicidal thoughts.
   Methods: Data are from Wave 2 of the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (analytic N= 34,326). Regression analysis assessed whether contextual (i.e., Geographic state) religiosity and membership rates of Catholics and the three major Protestant traditions, are associated with DSM-IV AUD risk in the past 12 months and suicidal thoughts since last interview, controlling for individual and state-level covariates. In a secondary analysis, we test for interactions between individual race/ethnicity and contextual religiosity on the outcomes since prior work suggested differences by race and individual religiosity.
   Results: Some contextual religious variables were significantly associated with AUD risk but not suicidal thoughts. Individuals living in a state with higher membership rates of Evangelical Protestant had higher AUD risk (Adjusted Relative Risk [ARR]= 1.27, 95% CI= 1.08-1.49). Individuals living in states with higher membership rates of Historically Black Protestant had a lower risk of AUD (ARR= 0.83, 95% CI= 0.72-0.96). The interaction between individual race and contextual-level religious variables on the outcomes were not significant.
   Limitations: NESARC is an observational cross-sectional so causality between religiosity and the outcomes cannot be established.
   Conclusions: The risk of AUD among individuals varies depending on the religious membership rates among Protestant groups within their geographic state of residence. Contextual religiosity may impact AUD risk above and beyond one's individual religiosity.

AB Suicide bombing attacks have emerged as a lethal weapon in the hands of terrorist groups. Our aim was to review the medical experience acquired in Israel, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States in managing terrorist attacks, and prepare medical systems for the difficult task of managing these events. EMS protocols are amended to deal with a large number of victims in an urban setting who must be rapidly evacuated to a medical center where resuscitative as well as definitive care is delivered. A combination of extensive soft tissue damage caused by penetrating injuries, blast injury to the lungs and tympanic membranes, and burns are common among survivors. Preparation must include establishment of a clear chain-of-command lead by a general surgeon who manages the event and is responsible for decisions regarding OR preferences and ICU admissions. The emergency department is re-organized to handle the influx of numerous severely injured casualties. Professional personnel and resources are recruited and re-directed away from routine tasks towards treating the victims. This is achieved by deferring non-urgent operations, procedures and imaging studies. Victims are frequently re-assessed and re-evaluated to control chaos, minimize missed injuries and ensure delivery of an adequate level of care.

AB Objective: A recent study (Lemaire) estimated the life expectancy loss attributable to gun deaths at 103.6 days for the overall U.S. population: 150.7 days for white males and 361.5 days for black males. This study estimates the life expectancy loss attributable to the premature death of individuals who initially survived gun-related traumatic brain injury (TBI) and spinal cord injury (SCI) in the United States.
   Design: Interpersonal TBI data were drawn from a surveillance system, and self-inflicted TBI data were obtained from the Web-based Injury Statistics and Reporting System. SCI data were obtained from a national database. Multiple decrement analysis was used to calculate the days of life lost to gunshot wounds to the brain and spinal cord, by race and gender, in the United States.
   Results: On average, across age, gender, and race, life expectancy in the United States is reduced by 3.1 days because of the shorter lifespan for individuals who survive an initial gunshot wound to the brain or spinal cord. Black males bear a disproportionate burden, losing 9.5 days, whereas white males lose 4.6 days. Black and white females lose 1.5 and 1.0 days, respectively.
   Conclusions: We add these findings to the Lemaire study, resulting in a total of 106.7 days of life expectancy loss from gunshot wounds for the U.S. population, with 37 1.0 days of life lost for black males.

AB Background Pesticide self-poisoning accounts for 14-20% of suicides worldwide. Regulation aimed at restricting access to pesticides or banning highly hazardous pesticides is one approach to reducing these deaths. We systematically reviewed the evidence of the effectiveness of pesticide regulation in reducing the incidence of pesticide suicides and overall suicides.
   Methods We did a systematic review of the international evidence. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase for studies published between Jan 1, 1960, and Dec 31, 2016, which investigated the effect of national or regional bans, and sales or import restrictions, on the availability of one or more pesticides and the incidence of suicide in different countries. We excluded other interventions aimed at limiting community access to pesticides. We extracted data from studies presenting pesticide suicide data and overall suicide data from before and after national sales restrictions. Two reviewers independently assessed papers for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We undertook a narrative synthesis of the data in each report, and where data were available for the years before and after a ban, we pooled data for the 3 years before and the 3 years after to obtain a crude estimate of the effect of the ban. This study is registered through PROSPERO, number CRD42017053329.
   Findings We identified 27 studies undertaken in 16 countries-five low-income or middle-income countries (Bangladesh, Colombia, India, Jordan and Sri Lanka), and 11 high-income countries (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, UK, and USA). Assessments largely focused on national bans of specific pesticides (12 studies of bans in six countries-Jordan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Greece [ Crete], South Korea, and Taiwan) or sales restrictions (eight studies of restrictions in five countries-India, Denmark, Ireland, the UK and the USA). Only five studies used optimum analytical methods. National bans on commonly ingested pesticides in five of the six countries studied, including four studies using optimum analytical methods, were followed by reductions in pesticide suicides and, in three of these countries, falls in overall suicide mortality. Greece was the only country studied that did not show a decrease in pesticide suicide following a ban. There were no high-quality studies of restricting sales to people for occupational uses; four of the seven studies (in three of the five countries studied-India, Denmark, and the USA) showed sales restrictions were followed by decreases in pesticide suicides; one of the two studies investigating trends in overall suicide mortality reported a fall in deaths in Denmark, but there were also decreases in suicide deaths from other methods.
   Interpretation National bans on highly hazardous pesticides, which are commonly ingested in acts of self-poisoning, seem to be effective in reducing pesticide-specific and overall suicide rates. Evidence is less consistent for sales restrictions. A worldwide ban on the use of highly hazardous pesticides is likely to prevent tens of thousands of deaths every year. Copyright (C) The Author(s).

AB Objective Methamphetamine (MA) use rates in the United States (US) have consistently demonstrated geographical variation and have been higher in the West and Midwest. This uneven pattern of use could be explained by regional differences in MA manufacturing and distribution, but may also result from differences in altitude. The hypobaric hypoxia found at high altitude alters neurotransmitter synthesis in the brain, which may contribute to MA use. The present study investigated the relationship between mean altitude and MA use rate in the 48 contiguous US states and the District of Columbia.
   Methods State-level estimates of past year MA use were extracted from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health report. The mean altitude of each state was calculated using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission altitude data set.
   Results There was a significant positive correlation between mean state altitude and MA use rate (r=0.66, p<0.0001). Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that altitude remained a significant predictor for MA use rate ((beta=0.36, p=0.02), after adjusting for age, ethnicity, education, socioeconomic level, employment, MA laboratory incidents, subpopulations, and other substance use.
   Conclusion Altitude appears to a possible contributing factor for regional variation of MA use in the US. Further studies will be required to determine biological changes in neurotransmission resulting from chronic mild hypoxia at high altitude in MA users.

AB IMPORTANCE Suicide is a leading cause of death among 10- to 24-year-old individuals in the United States; evidence on effective treatment for adolescents who engage in suicidal and self-harm behaviors is limited.
   OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) compared with individual and group supportive therapy (IGST) for reducing suicide attempts, nonsuicidal self-injury, and overall self-harm among high-risk youths.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized clinical trial was conducted from January 1, 2012, through August 31, 2014, at 4 academic medical centers. A total of 173 participants (pool of 195; 22 withdrew or were excluded) 12 to 18 years of age with a prior lifetime suicide attempt (>= 3 prior self-harm episodes, suicidal ideation, or emotional dysregulation) were studied. Adaptive randomization balanced participants across conditions within sites based on age, number of prior suicide attempts, and psychotropic medication use. Participants were followed up for 1 year.
   INTERVENTIONS Study participants were randomly assigned to DBT or IGST. Treatment duration was 6 months. Both groups had weekly individual and group psychotherapy, therapist consultation meetings, and parent contact as needed.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES A priori planned outcomes were suicide attempts, nonsuicidal self-injury, and total self-harm assessed using the Suicide Attempt Self-Injury Interview.
   RESULTS A total of 173 adolescents (163 [94.8%] female and 97 [56.4%] white; mean [SD] age, 14.89 [1.47] years) were studied. Significant advantages were found for DBT on all primary outcomes after treatment: suicide attempts (65 [90.3%] of 72 receiving DBT vs 51 [78.9%] of 65 receiving IGST with no suicide attempts; odds ratio [OR], 0.30; 95% CI, 0.10-0.91), nonsuicidal self-injury (41 [56.9%] of 72 receiving DBT vs 26 [40.0%] of 65 receiving IGST with no self-injury; OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.13-0.70), and self-harm (39 [54.2%] of 72 receiving DBT vs 24 [36.9%] of 65 receiving IGST with no self-harm; OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.14-0.78). Rates of self-harm decreased through 1-year follow-up. The advantage of DBT decreased, with no statistically significant between-group differences from 6 to 12 months (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.12-3.36; P=.61). Treatment completion rates were higher for DBT (75.6%) than for IGST (55.2%), but pattern-mixture models indicated that this difference did not informatively affect outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results of this trial support the efficacy of DBT for reducing self-harm and suicide attempts in highly suicidal self-harming adolescents. On the basis of the criteria of 2 independent trials supporting efficacy, results support DBT as the first well-established, empirically supported treatment for decreasing repeated suicide attempts and self-harm in youths.

AB This study explores the relationship between religious denomination, four dimensions of religious involvement, and suicidality (lifetime prevalence of suicide ideation and attempts) within a nationally representative sample of African American and Black Caribbean adults. The relationship between religious involvement and suicide for African Americans and Black Caribbeans indicated both similarities and differences. For both groups, religious involvement was largely protective against suicidal ideation and attempts, although, in some instances, specific measures were associated with higher suicidality. Looking to God for strength, comfort, and guidance was protective against suicidal attempts and ideation, whereas stating that prayer is important in stressful situations was associated with higher levels of ideation for both groups and higher attempts among Black Caribbeans. For African Americans, reading religious materials was positively associated with suicidal ideation. Among Black Caribbeans, subjective religiosity was negatively associated with ideation, and being Catholic was inversely associated with attempts, whereas being Pentecostal was inversely associated with ideation. These findings are discussed in relation to previous research and current conceptual frameworks that specify multiple (e. g., prevention and resource mobilization) and often divergent pathways of religious effects on physical and mental health outcomes.

AB With the collapse of Communism, statistics relating to previously 'taboo' phenomena such as homicide became available in the Soviet Union for the first time in over 50 years. The current study builds on several recent studies of homicide in Russia by extending both its time-frame and geographical coverage. Taking data from the end of the tsarist (1910) and Communist (1989) periods, the study maps the changes that occurred in the geographical distribution of homicide rates in 'European Russia' across the Soviet years. While non-Russian areas tended to remain or become less violent, Russia became more violent. These differences may have had a cultural component underlying them which was further exacerbated by the role of the state in the Soviet period.

AB Using Gallup World Poll data, we examined the role of societal wealth for meaning in life across 132 nations. Although life satisfaction was substantially higher in wealthy nations than in poor nations, meaning in life was higher in poor nations than in wealthy nations. In part, meaning in life was higher in poor nations because people in those nations were more religious. The mediating role of religiosity remained significant after we controlled for potential third variables, such as education, fertility rate, and individualism. As Frankl (1963) stated in Man's Search for Meaning, it appears that meaning can be attained even under objectively dire living conditions, and religiosity plays an important role in this search.

AB Fatality reviews are part of the public health arsenal to mortality prevention. As such they rely on medico-legal practitioners' participation. Yet medico-legal practice in the United States is still divided between the scientific approach of medical examiners systems and the political approach of coroners systems. I argue that this is related to the public's reluctance to let go of its jurisdiction over death as a social fact. I posit that attempts at systematizing coroners' inquests, as in Washington State, illustrate such resistance, yet could be conceived as a compromise between the political and the scientific, benefiting public health and the goal of fatality reviews.

AB Introduction:To better understand depression in United States (US) servicewomen, needs assessment data from the Service Women's Action Network (SWAN) were collected and analyzed, with comparison samples drawn from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The purpose of the present study was threefold. First, an assessment of the spatial distribution of depression in the United States among military women was made using geographic information systems. Second, the authors sought to determine differences in the prevalence of undiagnosed mental health concerns and diagnosed depression in women by military service status. Third, the authors sought to identify risk factors for depression among military women. Methods: Frequencies and percentages for all demographic, geographic, and outcome variables were calculated by military service status and data source. Differences among three groups - non-Veteran respondents of the BRFSS, Veteran respondents of the BRFSS, and SWAN member Veterans - were analyzed with the Chi-square test of independence. Estimates of the state-level prevalence of undiagnosed mental health concerns and diagnosed depression among military women who responded to either the 2016 BRFSS or the 2017 SWAN needs assessment were calculated and represented with state-boundary choropleth maps in Quantum GIS (QGIS). Results: A multinomial logistic regression model, adjusted for educational attainment, race, ethnicity, employment status, US region, and rurality, showed that military women and women Veterans were more likely to have undiagnosed mental health concerns and diagnosed depression, chi(2) (28) = 4,891.91, p < 0.001, Nagelkerke's R-2 = 0.03. Spatial analysis indicated that respondents living in the South were more likely to have diagnosed depression or undiagnosed mental health symptoms in both the BRFSS and SWAN needs assessment samples. Discussion: Primary findings from this study suggest that given the regional variation in depression among women Veterans, future studies should work to examine the role of the region in mental health for servicewomen in the United States, looking at available services and cultural differences. Recommendations include targeted programming for women Veterans.

AB BACKGROUND: Gun violence remains a leading cause of death in the United States. Community gun buyback programs provide an opportunity to dispose of extraneous firearms. The purpose of this study was to understand the demographics, motivation, child access to firearms, and household mental illness of buyback participants in hopes of improving the program's effectiveness.
   METHODS: A 2015 Injury Free Coalition for Kids gun buyback program which collaborated with local police departments was studied. We administered a 23-item questionnaire survey to gun buyback participants assessing demographic characteristics, motivation for relinquishing firearms, child firearm accessibility, and mental illness/domestic violence history.
   RESULTS: A total of 186 individuals from Central/Western Massachusetts turned in 339 weapons. Participants received between US $25 and US $75 in gift cards dependent on what type of gun was turned in, with an average cost of $41/gun. A total of 109 (59%) participants completed the survey. Respondents were mostly white (99%), men (90%) and first-time participants in the program(85.2%). Among survey respondents, 54% turned in firearms "for safety reasons." Respondents reported no longer needing/wanting their weapons (47%) and approximately one in eight participants were concerned the firearm(s) were accessible to children. Most respondents (87%) felt the program encouraged neighborhood awareness of firearm safety. Three of every five participants reported that guns still remained in their homes; additionally, 21% where children could potentially access them and 14% with a history of mental illness/suicide/domestic violence in the home.
   CONCLUSION: Gun buybacks can provide a low-cost means of removing unwanted firearms from the community. Most participants felt their homes were safer after turning in the firearm(s). In homes still possessing guns, emphasis on secure gun storage should continue, increasing the safety of children and families. The results of this survey also provided new insights into the association between mental illness/suicide and gun ownership. Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Context: There has been increasing concern about the impact of the global economic recession on mental health. To date, findings on the relationship between income and mental illness have been mixed. Some studies have found that lower income is associated with mental illness, while other studies have not found this relationship.
   Objective: To examine the relationship between income, mental disorders, and suicide attempts.
   Design: Prospective, longitudinal, nationally representative survey.
   Setting: United States general population.
   Participants: A total of 34 653 noninstitutionalized adults (aged >= 20 years) interviewed at 2 time points 3 years apart.
   Main Outcomes: Lifetime DSM-IV Axis I and Axis II mental disorders and lifetime suicide attempts, as well as incident mental disorders and change in income during the follow-up period.
   Results: After adjusting for potential confounders, the presence of most of the lifetime Axis I and Axis II mental disorders was associated with lower levels of income. Participants with household income of less than $20 000 per year were at increased risk of incident mood disorders during the 3-year follow-up period in comparison with those with income of $70 000 or more per year. A decrease in household income during the 2 time points was also associated with an increased risk of incident mood, anxiety, or substance use disorders (adjusted odds ratio, 1.30; 99% confidence interval, 1.06-1.60) in comparison with respondents with no change in income. Baseline presence of mental disorders did not increase the risk of change in personal or household income in the follow-up period.
   Conclusions: Low levels of household income are associated with several lifetime mental disorders and suicide attempts, and a reduction in household income is associated with increased risk for incident mental disorders. Policymakers need to consider optimal methods of intervention for mental disorders and suicidal behavior among low-income individuals.

AB Background: Sudden deaths are common findings in Rivers state of Nigeria. The victims of such deaths are subjects, of coroners' autopsies, and the records there from constitute important sources of epidemiological data.
   Aims: To determine the pattern, causes and demographic features of all deaths reported to the coroner for medico legal autopsies in Rivers state of Nigeria.
   Materials and methods: Retrospective descriptive study on reports of coroner autopsies carried out between January 2000 and December 2010 in different mortuaries located across Rivers state was undertaken. The autopsies were unlimited and standardized. Information analyzed were: gender, age, circumstances of death and, autopsy-defined cause of death.
   Results: Of the 1987 cases reviewed, 83.4% were males. The age range was 2 weeks to 98 years with a mean of, 31.7 years. The peak age range was 21-30 years with 46.5%. The manners of deaths in descending order include: homicides with 50.5%, accidents with 32%, sudden natural deaths with 14.1%, maternal deaths with 2.6% and suicides with 0.8%. Males were most affected in homicidal death with average male: female ratio of 12.4:1. Gunshots constituted the commonest means of homicidal deaths, with 67.9% while decapitation was the least with 0.1%. The commonest cause of accidental death was, road traffic accident with 63.6%. Cardiovascular system pathologies were the commonest causes of natural deaths with 46.1%. Illegal abortions with 41.1% were the commonest causes of maternal, deaths and all suicidal cases were committed by hanging.
   Conclusions: Homicides were by far the commonest findings of medico legal autopsies, followed by accidental and natural deaths respectively while suicides were the least in Rivers state of Nigeria. Firearms were the, most frequently used weapons for homicides and road traffic accidents remain the major causes of accidental deaths while cardiovascular system pathologies account for the highest proportion of sudden natural deaths and suicides are committed by hanging. Males within the productive age, brackets of 20-49 years are more affected by sudden deaths of all manners. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Suicide is a leading cause of preventable death in the United States and worldwide, with symptoms of depression and psychosis relating to increases in risk for ideation, attempt, and completion. This study examined moderating effects of depression in the relationships between three categories of psychotic symptoms (experiencing only hallucinations, only delusions, and both hallucinations and delusions) and suicidal ideation. Data (n = 12,195) were obtained from the cross-sectional Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys data which include large general population-based samples of households in the United States. Data were examined using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) in Mplus 8. Approximately 19% of the sample met criteria for major depression and 13% reported having the experience of suicidal ideation. Only 16% of the sample reported having a diagnosis of schizophrenia and/or a psychotic disorder. Depression functioned as a moderator and among those who experienced depression, increases in all psychotic symptom categories significantly related to increased likelihood of experiencing suicidal ideation. Among those who were not depressed, increases in two psychotic symptom categories (only hallucinations and both hallucinations and delusions) were significantly related to greater likelihood of experiencing suicidal ideation. Findings emphasize the high-risk for ideation among individuals who experience hallucinations or delusions, with the cumulative effect of experiencing both hallucinations and delusions being most harmful in relation to the likelihood of experiencing suicidal ideation; particularly so among those who were depressed. Assessment of risk factors for suicidal ideation is imperative given its relationship to the potential of suicide attempt and/or completion.

By the year 2050, it is projected to compose more than a fifth of the entire population, representing a 147% increase in this age group. There has been a steady increase in the number of medical and psychiatric disorders, and a large percentage of geriatric patients are now presenting to the emergency department with such disorders. The management of our progressively complex, geriatric patient population will require an integrative team approach involving emergency medicine, psychiatry, and hospitalist medicine.

AB Regulatory agencies of different European countries and the United States have been critically examining the possible link between suicidality and antidepressant use in children and adults, which has resulted in an FDA directive to the manufacturers of all antidepressant medications to add a 'black box' warning. 'Black box' warning describes the increased risk of suicidality in persons who take antidepressants. Because the news media's coverage of the antidepressant-suicide controversy has increased dramatically in the last few years, serious concerns need to be performed. In this review, the possible risk-benefit ratio has been estimated according to the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) antidepressants due to relevant psychobiological, clinical and epidemiologic data.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Emerging evidence indicates transgender adolescents (TGAs) exhibit elevated rates of suicidal ideation and attempt compared with cisgender adolescents (CGAs). Less is known about risk among subgroups of TGAs because of limited measures of gender identity in previous studies. We examined disparities in suicidality across the full spectrum of suicidality between TGAs and CGAs and examined risk for suicidality within TGA subgroups. METHODS: Adolescents aged 14 to 18 completed a cross-sectional online survey (N = 2020, including 1148 TGAs). Participants reported gender assigned at birth and current gender identity (categorized as cisgender males, cisgender females, transgender males, transgender females, nonbinary adolescents assigned female at birth, nonbinary adolescents assigned male at birth, and questioning gender identity). Lifetime suicidality (passive death wish, suicidal ideation, suicide plan, suicide attempt, and attempt requiring medical care) and nonsuicidal self-injury were assessed. RESULTS: Aggregated into 1 group, TGAs had higher odds of all outcomes as compared with CGAs. Within TGA subgroups, transgender males and transgender females had higher odds of suicidal ideation and attempt than CGA groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we used comprehensive measures of gender assigned at birth and current gender identity within a large nationwide survey of adolescents in the United States to examine suicidality among TGAs and CGAs. TGAs had higher odds of all suicidality outcomes, and transgender males and transgender females had high risk for suicidal ideation and attempt. Authors of future adolescent suicidality research must assess both gender assigned at birth and current gender identity to accurately identify and categorize TGAs.
   Suicidality subgroup differences among TGAs remain underexplored, and our results examine subgroup differences using comprehensive measures of gender identity.

AB Objective: To examine risk factors for suicidal ideation among people with multiple sclerosis (MS).
   Design: Cohort study linking computerized medical records with a mailed self-report survey.
   Setting: Veteran's Health Administration (VHA) region covering the northwestern United States.
   Participants: VHA patients with MS (N=445) who returned mailed surveys.
   Interventions: Not applicable.
   Main Outcome Measure: Suicidal ideation is assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) suicide item with suicidal ideation more than half the days considered persistent.
   Results: One hundred thirty-one (29.4%) of 445 respondents (95% confidence interval [CI], 25.4%-33.9%) endorsed suicidal ideation, and 35 (7.9%; 95% CI, 5.7%-10.8%) endorsed persistent suicidal ideation over the last 2 weeks. In bivariate analyses, suicidal ideation was associated with younger age, earlier disease course, progressive disease subtype, lower income, not being married, lower social support, not driving, higher levels of physical disability (mobility, bowel, bladder), and depression. Analyses on persistent suicidal ideation yielded similar results. In fully adjusted multivariate logistic regression, only depression severity and bowel disability were independently associated with suicidal ideation. Only depression severity was independently associated with persistent suicidal ideation. By using the 2-question depression screen (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force) consisting of the depression and anhedonia items from the PHQ-9, sensitivity and specificity were marginal for suicidal ideation (65.6% and 79.9%) but acceptable for persistent suicidal ideation (88.6% and 71.2%).
   Conclusions: Suicidal ideation is common among VHA patients with MS, and depression severity is the best risk marker. Brief screening for depression in MS should include the assessment of suicidal ideation.

AB Background: Little is known about the changes in the ranking of leading cause of death (COD) among people died with schizophrenia across years in the United States (U.S.). This study aims to determine the ranking of leading COD among U.S. decedents with mention of schizophrenia by age from 2000 to 2015.
   Methods: The mortality multiple COD files maintained by the National Center for Health Statistics were used to identify decedents aged 15 years old and above with mention of schizophrenia anywhere on the death certificates to determine the number and proportion of deaths attributed to various underlying CODs.
   Results: Of 13,289, 13,655, 14,135, and 15,033 people who died in 2000-2003, 2004-2007, 2008-2011 and 2012-2015 with mention of schizophrenia, similar to all decedents, heart disease and cancer was the first and the second leading COD throughout the study years. Schizophrenia ranked the third in most years except in 2004-2007. The first leading COD for decedents with mention of schizophrenia aged 15-24, 25-44, 45-64, 65-74, and 75+ years old in 2012-2015 was suicide, accidents, heart disease, heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease and related dementia, respectively. Nevertheless, it was accidents, accidents, cancer, cancer, and heart disease, respectively for all decedents.
   Conclusion: The ranking of leading CODs among U.S. decedents with mention of schizophrenia changed across years and differed from all decedents by age, which suggest that different interventions should be designed accordingly. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Evidence suggests that patients with bipolar disorder from the United States have an earlier age of onset and a more difficult course of illness than those from Germany and the Netherlands. These characteristics were related to a greater family burden of psychiatric illness and the experience of more psychosocial adversity in childhood. We hypothesized that this greater illness burden would extend to the offspring of the US patients.
   Methods: 968 outpatients (average age 41) with bipolar illness gave informed consent for participation in a treatment outcome network and filled out a detailed questionnaire about their illness and family history of illness, including whether their offspring had a diagnosis of depression, bipolar disorder, alcohol or substance abuse, suicide attempt or "other" illness. Of those with children, 356 were from the US and 132 were from Europe.
   Results: Compared to the Europeans, offspring of patients from the US had significantly (p < 0.001) more depression, bipolar disorder, drug abuse, and "other" illnesses. The number of illnesses in the offspring was related to the bipolar parent being from the US, having had childhood adversity, more than 20 prior episodes, and more parental psychiatric illness.
   Conclusions: While the findings are limited by their basis on self report, the distribution of the percentages in the US offspring are similar to those of Axelson et al. (2015) who used direct interviews. The higher burden of illness in the offspring and their in direct progenitors from the US compared to Europe warrant new attempts at better treatment and prevention. (c) 2016 The Authors.

AB Rural populations have different demographics and health issues compared to their metropolitan counterparts, including higher mortalities from ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, unintentional injuries, motor vehicle accidents, and suicide. Rural primary care physicians (PCPs) have a unique position in counseling, preventing, and treating common issues that are specific to rural populations, such as motor vehicle accidents, unintentional injuries, pesticide poisoning, occupational respiratory illnesses, and mental illness. They are also in a unique position to address prevention and social determinants of health. Rural PCPs can use multiple strategies to improve access to medical care.

AB IMPORTANCE Firearm injury is the second leading cause of death in the United States for children and young adults. The risk of unintentional and self-inflicted firearm injury is lower when all household firearms are stored locked.
   OBJECTIVE To estimate the reduction in youth firearm suicide and unintentional firearm mortality that would result if more adults in households with youth stored household guns locked.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A modeling study using Monte Carlo simulation of youth firearm suicide and unintentional firearm mortality in 2015. A simulated US national sample of firearm-owning households where youth reside was derived using nationally representative rates of firearm ownership and storage and population data from the US Census to test a hypothetical intervention, safe storage of firearms in the home, on youth accidental death and suicide. Data analyses were performed from August 3, 2017, to January 9, 2018.
   EXPOSURES Observed and counterfactual household-level safe firearm storage (ie, storing all firearms locked), the latter estimated by varying the probability that a hypothetical intervention increased safe firearm storage beyond that observed in 2015.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Observed and counterfactual counts of firearm suicide and unintentional firearm mortality among youth aged 0 to 19 years, the latter estimated by incorporating an empirically based estimate of the mortality benefit expected from additional safe storage (beyond that observed in 2015).
   RESULTS A hypothetical intervention among firearm owners residing with children with a 20% probability of motivating these owners to lock all household firearms was significantly associated with a projected reduction in youth firearm mortality (median incidence rate ratio = 0.90; interquartile range, 0.87-0.93). In the overall model, 6% to 32% of deaths were estimated to be preventable depending on the probability of motivating safer storage.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Results of this modeling study suggest that a relatively modest uptake of a straightforward safe storage recommendation-lock all household firearms-could result in meaningful reductions in firearm suicide and unintentional firearm fatalities among youth. Approaches that will motivate additional parents to store firearms safely are needed.

AB Most deaths in the United States occur under the care of a physician. In most of these cases, decisions must be made about whether to initiate and continue or withdraw life-sustaining medical technology, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, ventilation, nutrition and hydration, dialysis, transfusions, and antibiotics. All are part of a medical technological armamentarium that should be used when the goal of treatment is a cure. When a cure is not possible or appropriate, these medical technologies should be withdrawn or withheld. The circumstances in which end of life treatment may be ethically and legally limited through withholding or withdrawal are discussed.

AB This study is the first to investigate whether and, if so, why Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites in the United States differ in the variability of their lifespans. Although Hispanics enjoy higher life expectancy than whites, very little is known about how lifespan variability-and thus uncertainty about length of life-differs by race/ethnicity. We use 2010 U.S. National Vital Statistics System data to calculate lifespan variance at ages 10+ for Hispanics and whites, and then decompose the Hispanic-white variance difference into cause-specific spread, allocation, and timing effects. In addition to their higher life expectancy relative to whites, Hispanics also exhibit 7 % lower lifespan variability, with a larger gap among women than men. Differences in cause-specific incidence (allocation effects) explain nearly two-thirds of Hispanics' lower lifespan variability, mainly because of the higher mortality from suicide, accidental poisoning, and lung cancer among whites. Most of the remaining Hispanic-white variance difference is due to greater age dispersion (spread effects) in mortality from heart disease and residual causes among whites than Hispanics. Thus, the Hispanic paradox-that a socioeconomically disadvantaged population (Hispanics) enjoys a mortality advantage over a socioeconomically advantaged population (whites)-pertains to lifespan variability as well as to life expectancy. Efforts to reduce U.S. lifespan variability and simultaneously increase life expectancy, especially for whites, should target premature, young adult causes of death-in particular, suicide, accidental poisoning, and homicide. We conclude by discussing how the analysis of Hispanic-white differences in lifespan variability contributes to our understanding of the Hispanic paradox.

TI Technology-Oriented Suicide Prevention Interventions for Adolescents and

SO ADOLESCENT RESEARCH REVIEW

AB Youth suicide is increasing in the United States. To moderate youth suicide, it is important to implement effective prevention programs and target modifiable protective and risk factors through intervention. This review examined programs that are consistent with these goals, specifically, technology-oriented suicide prevention programs included in the National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices (NREPP) and Best Practices Registry (BPR). Technology-oriented programs are highly accessible among adolescents, as well as adolescent gatekeepers. Gatekeepers were defined as adults in a community who frequently interact with youth in the community, and who may be trained to identify and refer at-risk youth (e.g., teachers, coaches, counselors, parents). To understand the impact of these interventions, program efficacy (i.e., outcomes), program reach (i.e., population-level impact, level of technology integration), location of supporting program evidence (i.e., medical literature, Google Scholar, national registries, program organizational website), and quality of supporting research evidence (i.e., study design, quality of research ratings) were explored. PubMed, Psy-cINFO, PsycARTICLES, PASCAL, CINAHL, Scopus, Cochrane Library (n = 3,942); Google Scholar (n = 411); the NREPP (n = 127); the BPR (n = 114); and program organizational websites (n = 26) were searched. Published and unpublished studies (n = 35) were integrated. Review of technology-oriented interventions indicated that many have been found to improve secondary outcomes, suicide outcomes, and gatekeeper preparedness. Interventions also demonstrated potential for reach, as technology generally enhanced the spread of prevention content among adolescents and/or adolescent gatekeepers. However, the accessibility of evidence was often reduced through dispersion, as evidence was retained within multiple forums (i.e., medical literature, Google Scholar, national registries, program organizational websites). Finally, the quality of supporting research evidence was generally strong, although there was variability with regard to rigor in study design and inclusion of large samples. Additional research is important toward strengthening the evidence base, and additional evidence that is readily accessible may increase both reach and sustained use, to enhance overall impact.

AB OBJECTIVES: To describe the characteristics and trends of exposures to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medications among individuals 0 to 19 years old reported to US poison control centers.
   METHODS: National Poison Data System data from 2000 through 2014 were retrospectively analyzed to examine pediatric ADHD medication exposures.
   RESULTS: From 2000 through 2014, there were 156365 exposures reported to US poison control centers related to ADHD medications. The overall rate of reported exposures increased 71.2% from 2000 to 2011, followed by a 6.2% decrease from 2011 to 2014. Three-fourths (76.0%) of exposures involved children 12 years old. Methylphenidate and amphetamine medications accounted for 46.2% and 44.5% of exposures, respectively. The most common reason for exposure was therapeutic error (41.6%). Intentional medication exposures (including suspected suicide and medication abuse and/or misuse) were reported most often among adolescents (13-19 years old), accounting for 50.2% of exposures in this age group. Overall, the majority of exposed individuals (60.4%) did not receive health care facility treatment; however, 6.2% were admitted to a hospital for medical treatment, and there were 3 deaths. The increasing number and rate of reported ADHD medication exposures during the study period is consistent with increasing trends in ADHD diagnosis and medication prescribing. Exposures associated with suspected suicide or medication abuse and/or misuse among adolescents are of particular concern.
   CONCLUSIONS: Unintentional and intentional pediatric exposures to ADHD medications are an increasing problem in the United States, affecting children of all ages.

AB This article is a response to Young's (2016) essay on high white death rates in Kansas. I argue that a focus on external causes would further help researchers theorize about how and why certain behavioral factors link declining white populations to various mortality changes. Additional work that examines changing mortality patterns by sex and race and that extends analyses to the entire nation will provide further tests of Young's thesis. In this context, I encourage researchers to consider how intergenerational comparisons and cohort effects may produce some of the observed patterns.

AB Less is known about the multiplicative effects of social and psychological risk and protective factors of suicidality on college campuses. The current study aimed to investigate the multiplicative effects of social (identifying oneself as gay/lesbian, financial difficulty, violence victimization, and religiosity) and psychological (anxiety, depression, problem alcohol use, drug use) and risk/protective factors on suicidal behaviors among college students in the United States. Using a cross-sectional design, the Healthy Mind Study (HMS; 2016-2017), is a national online survey of college students in the United States. Social (identifying oneself as gay/lesbian, violence victimization, financial difficulty, and religiosity) and psychological (anxiety, depression, problem alcohol use, and drug use) risk/protective factors were assessed among 27,961 individuals. Three aspects of suicidality, including ideation, plan, and attempt, were also assessed. Logistic regression models were used for data analysis. Financial difficulty, violence victimization, identifying oneself as gay/lesbian, anxiety, depression, and drug use increased, while religiosity reduced the odds of suicidal behaviors. Multiplicative effects were found between the following social and psychological risk factors: (1) financial difficulty and anxiety; (2) financial difficulty and depression; (3) depression and drug use; (4) problem alcohol use and drug use; and (5) depression and problem alcohol use. There is a considerable overlap in the social and psychological processes, such as financial stress, mood disorders, and substance use problems, on risk of suicide in college students. As social and psychological risk factors do not operate independently, comprehensive suicidal risk evaluations that simultaneously address multiple social and psychological risk factors may be superior to programs that only address a single risk factor.

AB The opioid epidemic continues to take thousands of lives each year in the United States, more than motor vehicle accidents and suicides combined. Real solutions, based on science, will require a culture shift in the way that we think about and respond to substance use disorders, in the healthcare system and in our communities. Just more of the same approach will not turn the tide. This article discusses how to better understand the use of psychoactive drugs and how prevention, treatment and policy change can disseminate evidence-based practices, fight stigma, and advance harm reduction; not only as strategies to improve outcomes, but as a social justice movement as well.

AB What is the legacy of Peoples Temple? Forty years after the events at Jonestown it seems that "Jonestown" has solidified itself as a landmark moment in American religious history. Jonestown has become synonymous with the problems of charismatic religious leadership and religious violence. Yet, the group who died at Jonestown, Peoples Temple, is largely unknown to people who reference the Jonestown murders/suicides. This article argues that revisiting Peoples Temple's goals of apostolic socialism and racial reconciliation offer important insights for understanding the group's legacy that can contribute insight into ways of solving ongoing social problems related to poverty and racial inequality in the United States.

Despite this impact, little is known about the overall rates of risk-taking behaviors in patients currently being treated for such illness. This study examined the frequency of a variety of risk-taking behaviors in 100 adults with bipolar spectrum disorders in an active outpatient psychiatric treatment. It was found that 70% of individuals assessed reported at least one risk-taking behavior over the preceding 7 days. Implications for assessment and intervention are discussed.

The 20 highest rated television programs for each year from 1960 to 1990 were rated in terms of,meaningfulness of content, realism of characters, and complexity of plot and compared to the indicators of societal threat. Results indicate thar during times of societal threat people choose meaningful television programming that confronts serious issues.

AB BACKGROUND Suicidal ideation, an important risk factor for suicide, is strongly associated with substance use. Factors such as family cohesion, connection with friends, and social support can be protective against suicidal behaviors. The purpose of this study was to explore the association between suicidal ideation, substance use, and resiliency factors among middle school students. METHODS The 2013 New Mexico Youth Risk and Resiliency Survey provided the data for this analysis. Suicidal ideation was defined as affirmative responses to questions about thoughts of killing oneself and/or making a suicide plan. We used logistic regression to explore the association between suicidal ideation, substance use, and resiliency factors. RESULTS Overall, 23% of students reported suicidal ideation. Among girls, having a caring friend was associated with lower odds of suicidal ideation only among those not using other drugs. Among boys, having a caring friend decreased the odds of suicidal ideation regardless of substance use. CONCLUSIONS Suicidal ideation is prevalent among middle school children. Substance abuse is associated with suicidal ideation; however, individual and community support can be protective. Interventions aimed at reducing suicidal behaviors among middle school students should account for the impact of substance use and help strengthen social support.

AB This cross-sectional study investigated the prevalence rates of different categories of youth risk behaviour by age, sex and parental education. The study population consisted of 26,111 Hong Kong students, aged 10-19 years, recruited from 48 primary (primary grades 4-6) and secondary schools (secondary grades 1-7). Less than one-third of subjects participated in vigorous exercise regularly, about one-third consumed an unhealthy diet frequently, 18% had tried smoking, and 14.5% had seriously considered attempting suicide. Although only 3.4% of students reported experience of sexual intercourse, less than half used a contraceptive device. Older students had higher prevalence rates of health-compromising behaviours than younger students. Female students were more likely to report suicide-related behaviour, attempting weight loss, and non-participation in vigorous physical activities. Students with parents of a lower educational background were more likely to report rarely or never wearing seat belts and bicycle helmets, suicide-related behaviour, smoking, sexual intercourse before 13 years of age, and attempting weight loss. The availability of data on youth health risk behaviours would enable health educators, public health practitioners and clinicians to plan appropriate screening and counselling for risk behaviours in early adolescents.

AB To determine whether early-onset panic attack (less than or equal to20 years) with fear at onset represents a possible prodrome of early-onset severe psychopathology, we drew data from the National Comorbidity Survey (N = 8,098), a probability sample drawn from respondents age 18 to 54 in the 48 contiguous United States. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine differences in age of onset of comorbid mental disorders, familial psychopathology, and lethality of suicide attempts between those with early-onset panic attacks with fear at onset compared with individuals with panic attacks that do not meet this criteria. Logistic regression analyses revealed that respondents with early-onset panic attack with fear at onset (n = 86) had significantly earlier onset of almost every comorbid mental disorder, higher rates of familial psychopathology, and increased risk and lethality of suicide attempt compared with those with other panic attacks (n = 336). These findings provide preliminary evidence to suggest that early-onset fearful panic attack may be a marker of risk of a lengthy course of severe psychopathology, which is predicted by familial mental illness, and is characterized by early onset and increased risk of serious suicidal behavior. Replication of these findings in other epidemiologic and clinical samples is needed. Copyright (C) 2002 by WB. Saunders Company.

AB As descendants of the indigenous peoples of the United States, American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) have experienced a resurgence in population and prospects since the beginning of the twentieth century. Today, tribally affiliated individuals number over two million, distributed across 565 federally recognized tribal communities and countless metropolitan and nonreservation rural areas. Although relatively little evidence is available, the existing data suggest that AI/AN adults and youth suffer a disproportionate burden of mental health problems compared with other Americans. Specifically, clear disparities have emerged for AI/AN substance abuse, posttraumatic stress, violence, and suicide. The rapid expansion of mental health services to AI/AN communities has, however, frequently preceded careful consideration of a variety of questions about critical components of such care, such as the service delivery structure itself, clinical treatment processes, and preventive and rehabilitative program evaluation. As a consequence, the mental health needs of these communities have easily outpaced and overwhelmed the federally funded agency designed to serve these populations, with the Indian Health Service remaining chronically understaffed and underfunded such that elimination of AI/AN mental health disparities is only a distant dream. Although research published during the past decade has substantially improved knowledge about AI/AN mental health problems, far fewer investigations have explored treatment efficacy and outcomes among these culturally diverse peoples. In addition to routine calls for greater clinical and research resources, however, AI/AN community members themselves are increasingly advocating for culturally alternative approaches and opportunities to address their mental health needs on their own terms.

ID RELIABILITY
AB In the United States, 71% of all deaths among persons aged 10-24 years result from 4 causes: motorvehicle crashes, other unintentional injuries, homicide, and suicide. Results from the 2005 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) indicated that during the 30 days preceding the survey, many high school students engaged in behaviors that increased their likelihood of death from these 4 causes: 9.9% had driven a car or other vehicle when they had been drinking alcohol, 18.5% had carried a weapon, 43.3% had drunk alcohol, and 20.2% had used marijuana. In addition, during the 12 months preceding the survey, 35.9% of high school students had been in a physical fight and 8.4% had attempted suicide. Substantial morbidity and social problems among youth also result from unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus infection. During 2005, a total of 46.8% of high school students had ever had sexual intercourse, 37.2% of sexually active high school students had not used a condom at last sexual intercourse, and 2.1% had ever injected an illegal drug. Among adults aged >= 25 years, 61% of all deaths result from 2 causes: cardiovascular disease and cancer. Results from the 2005 national YRBS indicated that risk behaviors associated with these 2 causes of death were initiated during adolescence. During 2005, a total of 23.0% of high school students had smoked cigarettes during the 30 days preceding the survey, 79.9% had not eaten >= 5 times/day of fruits and vegetables during the 7 days preceding the survey, 67.0% did not attend physical education classes daily, and 13.1% were overweight.

AB High mortality rates among persons with HIV with a history of injection drug use (PWID) are thought to be driven in part by higher rates of external cause-related mortality. We followed 4796 persons aged 18-70 engaged in continuity HIV care from 2001 to 2015 until death or administrative censoring. We compared cause-specific (csHR) and subdistribution hazards (sdHR) of death due to external causes among PWID and persons who acquired their HIV infection through other routes (non-IDU). We standardized estimates on age, sex, race, and HIV-related health status. The standardized csHR for external cause-related death was 3.57 (95% CI 2.39, 5.33), and the sdHR was 3.14 (95% CI 2.16, 4.55). The majority of external cause-related deaths were overdose-related and standardized sdHR was 4.02 (95% CI 2.40, 6.72). Absolute rate of suicide was low but the csHR for PWID compared to non-IDU was most elevated for suicide (6.50, 95% CI 1.51, 28.03). HIV-infected PWID are at a disproportionately increased risk of death due to external causes, particularly overdose and suicide.

AB HIV-positive status poses a unique set of social stressors, especially among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) persons. Among these difficulties are the internalization of HIV-related stigma and poor mental health. Unfortunately, substance use as a coping mechanism is also common, dependent on other demographic factors, among HIV-positive and LGB samples. The present study integrates these bodies of literature by examining main and interactive effects of HIV-related experiences (i.e., disclosure of HIV-positive status, fear of disclosure, HIV-related victimization, and internalized HIV-related stigma) and substance-related coping with discrimination as they impact mental health (i.e., stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and suicide and self-injury proneness). Participants were 216 HIV-positive LGB community members from an urban community medical clinic. Prominent results included: (1) robust negative effects of internalized HIV-related stigma on all mental health indicators when controlling for other HIV-related experiences and (2) a significant interaction in which substance-related coping significantly increases suicide proneness, only for those who have disclosed HIV-positive status to family or friends. Results are discussed with respect to theoretical perspectives of internalized stigma, implications for clinical work with LGB persons of HIV-positive status, and future research.

AB Objective: Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy among males, accounting for 19% of cancers, and the third most common cancer-related cause of death. Suicide rates in the United States have increased among males over the last decade. Further, suicide rates are higher in oncology patients, including patients with prostate cancer, compared to the general population. The objective of this article is to review the current literature and address the relationship between prostate cancer, depression, erectile dysfunction, and suicidal ideation.
   Materials and methods: We reviewed the current literature pertaining to prostate cancer and depression, and prostate cancer and suicide. Furthermore, associations were made between erectile dysfunction and depression.
   Results: Men with prostate cancer at increased risk for suicidal death are White, unmarried, elderly, and men with distant disease. Time since diagnosis is also an important factor, since men are at risk of suicide >15 years after diagnosis. Approximately 60% of men with prostate cancer experience mental health distress, with 10%-40% having clinically significant depression. Additionally, patients that received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) are 23% more likely to develop depression compared to those without ADT. Longitudinal studies of prostate cancer patients suggest that erectile dysfunction after curative treatment may have a significant psychological effect leading to depression. Herein, a newly proposed screening algorithm suggests for an evaluation with the expanded prostate cancer index composite-clinical practice, patient health questionnaire-9, and an 8-question suicidal ideation questionnaire to assess for health-related quality of life, depression, and suicidal ideation.
   Conclusion: The burden of screening for erectile dysfunction, depression and suicidal ideation lies with the entire health care team, as there appears to be an association between these diagnoses, that is, compounded in patients with prostate cancer. The screening algorithm should assist with guiding timely and appropriate psychiatric referral to optimize outcomes in these high-risk patients. Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved

Methods Data on pediatric FH was retrieved from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample between 1998 and 2011 (n = 16,998,470) using external cause of injury codes (E-codes) of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical modification, (assault: E9650-E9654, unintentional: E9220-E9224, E9228, and E9229, suicide: E9550-E9554, E9556, and E9559, undetermined: E9850-E9854, and E9856 and legal: E970). Meta-regression was used to determine the significance of temporal trends. Survey logistic regression adjusted for survey year was used to examine association of pediatric FH with social and demographic characteristics. Results An annual reduction of 1.07 per 100,000 hospitalizations (p-trend = 0.011) was observed between 1998 and 2011. There was reduction in rate of unintentional-FH (p-trend = 0.013), suicide-FH (p-trend = 0.029), and undetermined-FH (p-trend = 0.002), but not assault-FH (p-trend = 0.18). A decline in rates of FH was observed among whites (p-trend = 0.021) and Hispanics (p-trend = 0.03) while an increase in rates of assault-FH was observed among black children. All other intents and all other racial/ethnic groups showed declining rates during this interval. Conclusions There was an overall decline in rates of pediatric FHs in this time period driven by a decline in unintentional-FHs. However there was an increase in assault FH among black children during this same time period.

AB The study purpose was to determine the predictors of watching most of a Web-based streaming video and whether data characteristics differed for those watching most or only part of the video. A convenience sample of 650 students (349 Asian Americans and 301 non-Hispanic whites) was recruited from a public university in the United States. Study participants were asked to view a 27-minute suicide awareness streaming video and to complete online questionnaires. Early data monitoring showed many, but not all, watched most of the video. We added software controls to facilitate video completion and defined times for a video completion group (>= 26 minutes) and video noncompletion (<26 minutes) group. Compared with the video noncompletion group, the video completion group included more females, undergraduates, and Asian Americans, and had higher individualistic orientation and more correct manipulation check answers. The video noncompletion group skipped items in a purposeful manner, showed less interest in the video, and spent less time completing questionnaires. The findings suggest that implementing software controls, evaluating missing data patterns, documenting the amount of time spent completing questionnaires, and effective manipulation check questions are essential to control potential bias in Web-based research involving college students.

AB OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to highlight the differences in injury rates between populations through a descriptive epidemiological study of population-level trends in injury mortality for the high-income countries of Australia, Canada and the United States.
   METHODS: Mortality data were available for the US from 2000 to 2014, and for Canada and Australia from 2000 to 2012. Injury causes were defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision external cause codes, and were grouped into major causes. Rates were direct-method age-adjusted using the US 2000 projected population as the standard age distribution.
   RESULTS: US motor vehicle injury mortality rates declined from 2000 to 2014 but remained markedly higher than those of Australia or Canada. In all three countries, fall injury mortality rates increased from 2000 to 2014. US homicide mortality rates declined, but remained higher than those of Australia and Canada. While the US had the lowest suicide rate in 2000, it increased by 24% during 2000-2014, and by 2012 was about 14% higher than that in Australia and Canada. The poisoning mortality rate in the US increased dramatically from 2000 to 2014.
   CONCLUSION: Results show marked differences and striking similarities in injury mortality between the countries and within countries over time. The observed trends differed by injury cause category. The substantial differences in injury rates between similarly resourced populations raises important questions about the role of societal-level factors as underlying causes of the differential distribution of injury in our communities.

AB We investigated ethnic/religious mortality differentials in Bulgaria during the 1990s. The analyses employed a unique longitudinal data-set covering the entire population of Bulgaria from the census of 1992 until 1998. The mortality of Roma is very high compared to all other ethnic/religious groups. The excess applies to nearly every cause of death examined and is not entirely explained by the adverse location of Roma on social and economic variables. For young men, Muslim mortality is substantially lower than that of non-Muslims when socio-economic differences are controlled. An analysis of causes of death suggests that lower consumption of alcohol may contribute to this 'Muslim paradox'. For older Turkish women, a significant mortality disadvantage remains after controls are imposed. Suicide mortality is lower for Muslims than for Christian groups of the same ethnicity. Consistent with deteriorating economic conditions over the study period, mortality was rising, particularly for women.

AB Railroad and subway drivers can experience psychological trauma when trains strike or nearly miss other trains. motor vehicles, or persons or become instruments of death. Derailments, collisions, and suicides on the tracks can induce feelings of helplessness, horror, guilt, and anxiety in the drivers. Although some drivers experience acute stress disorder (ASD) or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), their conditions are not always acknowledged within the occupational setting. The world literature suggests that PTSD has been an increasing focus of concern, giving rise to detailed intervention protocols. In the United States, the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA) governs the adjudication of work-related injuries among railroad employees. In practice. it is difficult for railroad drivers with PTSD to receive benefits if there was no "direct impact" linked to the employer's negligence. In this article, the authors review the literature on PTSD among railroad drivers, discuss relevant case law, and explain how the FELA militates against some employees with PTSD.

AB Objective: To investigate the emotional feelings reported by physicians in the Netherlands after having performed euthanasia or other medical end-of-life decisions.
   Design: Nationwide interview study in the Netherlands, November 1995 through February 1996.
   Participants and setting: A random sample of 405 physicians (general practitioners, nursing home physicians, and clinical specialists).
   Main outcome measures: Subsequent feelings of physicians about their most recent cases (if any) of euthanasia, assisted suicide, life-ending without an explicit request from the patient, and alleviation of pain and other symptoms with high doses of opioids.
   Results: The response rate was 89%. In 52% of all cases of hastening death, physicians had feelings of comfort afterwards, which included feelings of satisfaction in 44% and of relief in 13%. Feelings of discomfort were reported in 42%, most frequently referred to as emotional (28%) or burdensome (25%). Feelings of discomfort were highest for euthanasia (75%; P < 0.000). 95% of physicians were willing to perform euthanasia or assisted suicide again in similar situations. Afterwards, 5% had doubts, but none had regrets, about performing euthanasia.
   Conclusions. Hastening the death of a patient evokes different feelings among physicians. Although performing euthanasia is often experienced as burdensome and emotional, granting the ultimate wish of a competent patient may also give physicians a feeling of having contributed to the quality of the dying process.

AB Concerns about opioid-related adverse events, including overdose, prompted the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to launch an Opioid Safety Initiative and Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution program. To mitigate risks associated with opioid prescribing, a holistic approach that takes into consideration both risk factors (e.g.,dose, substance use disorders) and risk mitigation interventions (e.g.,urine drug screening, psychosocial treatment) is needed. This article describes the Stratification Tool for Opioid Risk Mitigation ( STORM), a tool developed in VHA that reflects this holistic approach and facilitates patient identification and monitoring. STORM prioritizes patients for review and intervention according to their modeled risk for overdose/suicide-related events and displays risk factors and risk mitigation interventions obtained from VHA electronic medical record (EMR)-data extracts. Patients' estimated risk is based on a predictive risk model developed using fiscal year 2010 ( FY2010: 10/1/2009-9/30/2010) EMR- data extracts and mortality data among 1,135,601 VHA patients prescribed opioid analgesics to predict risk for an overdose/suicide-related event in FY2011 ( 2.1% experienced an event). Cross-validation was used to validate the model, with receiver operating characteristic curves for the training and test data sets performing well ( >.80 area under the curve). The predictive risk model distinguished patients based on risk for overdose/ suicide-related adverse events, allowing for identification of high-risk patients and enrichment of target populations of patients with greater safety concerns for proactive monitoring and application of risk mitigation interventions. Results suggest that clinical informatics can leverage EMR-extracted data to identify patients at-risk for overdose/suicide-related events and provide clinicians with actionable information to mitigate risk.

AB Objective: To test the hypothesis that self-injurious behavior (SIB) signals an attempt to cope with psychological distress that may co-occur or lead to suicidal behaviors in individuals experiencing more duress than they can effectively mitigate.
   Design: Analysis of a cross-sectional data set of collegeage students.
   Setting: Two universities in the northeastern United States in the spring of 2005.
   Participants: A random sample of 8300 students invited to participate in a Web-based survey; 3069 (37.0%) responded. Cases in which a majority of the responses were missing or in which SIB or suicide status was indeterminable were omitted, resulting in 2875 usable cases.
   Exposure: Self-injurious behavior.
   Main Outcome Measures: Main outcome was suicidality; adjusted odds ratios (AORs) for suicidality by SIB status when demographic characteristics, history of trauma, distress, informal help-seeking, and attraction to life are considered.
   Results: One quarter of the sample reported SIB, suicidality, or both; 40.3% of those reporting SIB also report suicidality. Self-injurious behavior status was predictive of suicidality when controlling for demographic variables (AOR, 6.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.9-7.8). Addition of trauma and distress variables attenuated this relationship (AOR, 3.7; 95% CI, 2.7-4.9). Compared with respondents reporting only suicidality, those also reporting SIB were more likely to report suicide ideation (AOR, 2.8; 95% CI, 2.0-3.8), plan (AOR, 5.6; 95% CI, 3.9-7.9), gesture (AOR, 7.3; 95% CI, 3.4-158), and attempt (AOR, 9.6; 95% CI, 5.4-17.1). Lifetime SIB frequency exhibits a curvilinear relationship to suicidality.
   Conclusions: Since it is well established that SIB is not a suicidal gesture, many clinicians assume that suicide assessment is unnecessary. Our findings suggest that the presence of SIB should trigger suicide assessment.

AB To address gaps in the literature on bisexual youth, we used the first nationally representative sample of high school students from the United States to determine profiles of behaviors related to depressive symptoms, a suicide attempt, and a medically-serious attempt. We examined the data from 922 bisexual students in grades 9-12 who completed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2015 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Latent class analysis derived three classes reflecting unique patterns of 10 risk and protective behaviors. For both the sexes: one group was high on all the risk behaviors and demonstrated the greatest risk of depression, a suicide attempt, and a medically-serious attempt; another was below average on all the risk and protective behaviors and demonstrated average/moderate risk of the outcomes; and the last demonstrated the highest levels of protective behaviors and the lowest risk of depression and suicidal behavior. Bisexual students are not homogenous with regard to the risk of mental health problems. Greater involvement in several risk behaviors and less involvement in protective behaviors, rather than merely a bisexual identity, might contribute to bisexual adolescents' increased risk of depression and suicidal behavior. Findings have implications for prevention programming, clinical interventions, and future research.

AB In this study indicators associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in a nationwide representative sample (N = 3,184) of Danes aged 16-35 years were examined. The study was cross-sectional and had three aims: (1) to draw a profile of persons with and without suicidal tendency established on a combined quartered variable on current suicidal thoughts and/or ever attempted suicide; (2) to explore whether the different suicidal tendencies constitute a severity continuum; and (3) to identify factors of significance for suicidal tendency. Factors included were demographic characteristics, living conditions, social network, external health risks, lifestyle, health-related quality of life, symptoms, morbidity, and illness behavior. A continuum hypothesis was not supported, as the multiple logistic regression analysis showed no clear gradient in the different forms of suicidal tendency. Cohabitation status (single, p < 0.0001), exposure to violent threats (p < 0.0001), exposure to sexual abuse (p < 0.0001), being a daily smoker (p < 0.0001), doing nothing to stay healthy (p < 0.0004), poor mental health (p < 0.0001), mental symptoms within the past 2 weeks (p = 0.0003), contact with psychologist (p < 0.0001), and absence from work due to illness (p = 0.005) were indicators significantly related to suicidal tendency.

AB Objectives We investigated trends in national childhood mortality racial disparities in child mortality and the effect of Medicaid and State Children s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) eligibility expansions on child mortality
   Methods We analyzed child mortality by state race and age using the National Center for Health Statistics multiple cause of death files over 20 years from 1985 to 2004
   Results Child mortality continued to decline in the United States but racial disparities in mortality remained Declines in child mortality (ages 1-17 years) were substantial for both natural (disease related) and external (injuries, homicide and suicide) causes for children of all races/ethnicities although Black-White mortality ratios remained unchanged during the study period Expanded Medicaid and SCHIP eligibility was significantly related to the decline in external cause mortality the relationship between natural cause mortality and Medicaid or SCHIP eligibility remains unclear Eligibility expansions did not affect relative racial disparities in child mortality
   Conclusions Although the study provides some evidence that public insurance expansions reduce child mortality future research is needed on the effect of new health insurance on child health and on factors causing relative racial disparities (Am J Public Health 2010 100 2500-2506 doi 10 2105/AJPH 2009 184622)

AB Background. A national study in Finland showed significantly higher death rates associated with abortion than with childbirth. Our objective was to examine this association using an American population over a longer period.
   Methods. California Medicaid records for 173,279 women who had an induced abortion or it delivery in 1989 were linked to death certificates for 1989 to 1997.
   Results. Compared with women who delivered, those who aborted had it significantly higher age-adjusted risk of death from all causes (1.62), from suicide (2.54), and from accidents (1.82), as well as a higher relative risk of death from natural causes (1.14), including the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (2.18), circulatory diseases (2.87), and cerebrovascular disease (5.46). Results are stratified by age and time.
   Conclusions. Higher death rates associated with abortion Persist over time and across socioeconomic boundaries. This may be explained by self-destructive tendencies, depression, and other unhealthy behavior aggravated by the abortion experience.

AB Introduction The promotion of safe firearm practices, or firearms means restriction, is a promising but infrequently used suicide prevention strategy in the USA. Safety Check is an evidence-based practice for improving parental firearm safety behaviour in paediatric primary care. However, providers rarely discuss firearm safety during visits, suggesting the need to better understand barriers and facilitators to promoting this approach. This study, Adolescent Suicide Prevention In Routine clinical Encounters, aims to engender a better understanding of how to implement the three firearm components of Safety Check as a suicide prevention strategy in paediatric primary care.
   Methods and analysis The National Institute of Mental Health-funded Mental Health Research Network (MHRN), a consortium of 13 healthcare systems across the USA, affords a unique opportunity to better understand how to implement a firearm safety intervention in paediatric primary care from a system-level perspective. We will collaboratively develop implementation strategies in partnership with MHRN stakeholders. First, we will survey leadership of 82 primary care practices (ie, practices serving children, adolescents and young adults) within two MHRN systems to understand acceptability and use of the three firearm components of Safety Check (ie, screening, brief counselling around firearm safety and provision of firearm locks). Then, in collaboration with MHRN stakeholders, we will use intervention mapping and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to systematically develop and evaluate a multilevel menu of implementation strategies for promoting firearm safety as a suicide prevention strategy in paediatric primary care.
   Ethics and dissemination Study procedures have been approved by the University of Pennsylvania. Henry Ford Health System and Baylor Scott & White institutional review boards (IRBs) have ceded IRB review to the University of Pennsylvania IRB. Results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.

AB Suicide ideation (SI) is considered a major psychiatric emergency in patients diagnosed with chronic illnesses. Suicide ideation is a multifaceted issue that involves bio-psychosocial and cultural factors that interfere with patients' abilities. The purpose of this study is to investigate the psychosocial predictors of SI among Jordanian patients with chronic illnesses. A cross-sectional design using self-administered questionnaires was used to collect data from 480 patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. The mean score of suicide ideation was 4.07 (SD = 1.7) and almost 20% (n = 85) of the participants found to be suicidal, the majority were suffering from moderate to severe depressive symptoms and low levels of life satisfaction. Also, the analysis showed that the patients had a high level of optimism and moderate perception of social support from family, friends, and significant other. Type of illness has a significant relation to the 'seriousness' component of SI (p = 0.023). Depression (beta = 0.345, p<0.001) was a significant risk factor for 'thought' component of SI, and optimism (beta = -0.008, p < 0.05) a significant protective factor against the thought component of SI. Patients with chronic illnesses suffer serious psychological disturbances and are in need of psychological care, and periodic psychological screening to maintain their psychological wellbeing.

AB Objectives. We systematically reviewed the effects of alcohol taxes and prices on alcohol-related morbidity and mortality to assess their public health impact.
   Methods. We searched 12 databases, along with articles' reference lists, for studies providing estimates of the relationship between alcohol taxes and prices and measures of risky behavior or morbidity and mortality, then coded for effect sizes and numerous population and study characteristics. We combined independent estimates in random-effects models to obtain aggregate effect estimates.
   Results. We identified 50 articles, containing 340 estimates. Meta-estimates were r=-0.347 for alcohol-related disease and injury outcomes, -0.022 for violence, -0.048 for suicide, -0.112 for traffic crash outcomes, -0.055 for sexually transmitted diseases, -0.022 for other drug use, and -0.014 for crime and other misbehavior measures. All except suicide were statistically significant.
   Conclusions. Public policies affecting the price of alcoholic beverages have significant effects on alcohol-related disease and injury rates. Our results suggest that doubling the alcohol tax would reduce alcohol-related mortality by an average of 35%, traffic crash deaths by 11%, sexually transmitted disease by 6%, violence by 2%, and crime by 1.4%.

SO SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR

DT Article
ID PARAPROFESSIONAL HELPERS; CENTERS
AB Research since the 1960s has consistently found that lay volunteers are better at helping suicidal callers than professionals. Yet, professional degrees are increasingly becoming requirements for helpline workers. In our first study, we conducted post hoc comparisons of U.S. helplines with all professional paid staff, all lay volunteers, and a mix of both, using silent monitoring and standardized assessments of 1,431 calls. The volunteer centers more often conducted risk assessments, had more empathy, were more respectful of callers, and had significantly better call outcome ratings. A second study of five Quebec suicide prevention centers used silent monitoring to compare telephone help in 1,206 calls answered by 90 volunteers and 39 paid staff. Results indicate no significant differences between the volunteers and paid employees on outcome variables. However, volunteers and paid staff with over 140hours of call experience had significantly better outcomes. Unlike the United States, Quebec paid employees were not required to have advanced professional degrees. We conclude from these results and previous research that there is no justification for requiring that suicide prevention helpline workers be mental health professionals. In fact, the evidence to date indicates that professionals may be less effective in providing telephone help to suicidal individuals when compared to trained lay volunteers.

AB This study identifies the conditions under which civilian shooter events in the United States become mass episodes of killing. Hitherto, researchers have examined many individual-level variables associated with mass shootings including personal deprivation, family problems, mental illness, among others. Apart from a handful of quantitative studies, scholars have yet to provide a comparative scope to the multiplicity of factors that are influential in bringing about a mass murder. Adopting fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, this study analyses (n = 44) civilian acts of violence that took place from 1975 to 2015 in which some shootings resulted in few deaths and others turned into mass bouts of killing. Empirical results reveal that no variables on their own are sufficient or necessary in accounting for the outcome of a mass shooting. Rather, configurations of causal conditions provide sufficient pathways and new insight into the particular circumstances under which a mass shooting is apt to take place in. The most salient of configurations tell us that mass shootings are prominently influenced by the combination of severe/multiple mental illnesses, a large number/high-powered guns and weak state gun law legislation. Another pathway reveals that mass shootings are also influenced by the interaction of radical ideology, severe/multiple mental illnesses, and high-state level gun ownership.

AB Insomnia is a risk factor for new onset, exacerbation, and relapse of mental illness. The goal of this study was to examine the prevalence, severity, and predictors of insomnia in hospitalized psychiatric patients. Ninety-seven consecutive psychiatric inpatients were administered the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) to evaluate the presence and severity of insomnia. Patients' hospital charts were reviewed for demographic and medical information. ISI scores in 79.4% of the patients reached the threshold criterion of 8 for insomnia. Insomnia was not mentioned as a clinical problem in the discharge notes problem list in any of these patients. Multivariate analysis indicated that age (p = 0.009), recent suicide attempt or ideation (P < 0.001), tobacco use (p = 0.024), and recreational drug use during the past month (p = 0.040) were significant predictors of insomnia severity. Insomnia was highly prevalent in this population. Identification and management of insomnia would be an important clinical goal in hospitalized psychiatric patients.

AB This study is the first to evaluate evidence for measurement invariance and the psychometric properties of the Suicide Resilience Inventory-25 (SRI-25; Osman et al., ) in college-age samples in both the United States and China. We found strong support for full measurement invariance of the three-factor structure of the SRI-25 in the U.S. (113 men and 238 women) and Chinese (121 men and 205 women) samples. In addition, we found that the U.S. sample scored significantly higher than the Chinese sample on all the individual scale scores. Composite scale reliability estimates ranged from moderate (=.83) to high (=.93) across the groups. Although not an aim of the current study, we examined estimates of internal consistency of the SRI-25 scales for men and women within each sample. Differential correlates of the SRI-25 scales were explored further for each sample. These results provide support for the use of the SRI-25 in U.S. and Chinese student samples.

ID INTERPERSONAL-PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORY; PERCEIVED BURDENSOMENESS;
   POPULATION; SYMPTOMS; VETERANS; BEHAVIOR; IDEATION
AB Suicidal desire in the military has been previously examined through the lens of the Interpersonal Psychological Theory of Suicide (IPTS). However, no research has examined the impact of specific coping strategies on perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, and suicidal ideation in a large population of individuals serving in the US military. Furthermore, the factor structure of previously utilized coping clusters did not apply to our sample of military personnel. Therefore, we found a three-factor solution to be tested in this sample. We hypothesized that specific types of coping behavior clusters (Adaptive and Maladaptive) would predict both IPTS constructs and suicidal ideation. Results indicated that Adaptive and Maladaptive coping clusters predicted the IPTS constructs in the hypothesized directions. However, only the Maladaptive cluster predicted suicidal ideation. These findings implicate the need for further research and suicide prevention efforts focusing on coping strategies, specifically those that are maladaptive in nature, in relation to suicidal ideation in military members.

AB Almost one-fourth of maltreated adolescents report they have thought about killing themselves in the last two weeks. We draw on Agnew's strain theory to develop a model to account for variability in suicidal thoughts among this high-risk group. We used data from a nationally representative sample of 572 maltreated adolescents, aged 11-15. One dimension of relational strain (poorer relationship with peers) and greater depressed mood were directly related to whether adolescents did or did not think about suicide. Depressed mood mediated the relationship between two strain variables (relationship with caregiver and with school) and suicidal thoughts. Child maltreatment strain (being severely harmed) and substance use were not directly related to suicidal thoughts; however, depressed mood appeared to mediate the relationship between drug use and suicidal thoughts. Adolescents who experience child maltreatment and who appear to be disconnected from caregivers, friends and school should be screened for depression and suicidal thoughts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The authors aim to facilitate the psychiatric evaluation of death-hastening decisions, such as cessation of life-support treatment or physician-assisted suicide, by deriving principles for evaluating patients from a literature review and a recently completed prospective study on dialysis discontinuation conducted by consultation psychiatrists. Factors are delineated and suggestions are provided for the evaluation of requests to accelerate dying. Included are the authors' method for determining major depression in the context of terminal illness and their "vector analysis " in assessing patient requests to stop dialysis. As our society heatedly examines the care provided to the terminally ill, psychiatry also needs to reconsider whether actions that foreshorten life can be normative and permissible. Familiarity with competency, psychiatric diagnosis, and ease in communication and negotiation between patient, family, and staff are resources that psychiatrists can bring to these complicated assessments. Challenging areas include diagnosing depression, establishing the adequacy of palliative care, and appreciating issues related to personality features, family dynamics, and ethnic differences.

AB This study examined the association between cognitive control capacities, suicidal thoughts and attempts, and depressive symptoms during late adolescence and young adulthood. The sample included 4192 participants (55.5% female) from the United States who participated in Waves III (2001-2002; respondent age 18-26 years) and IV (2007-2008; respondent age 24-33 years) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Suicidality in late adolescence predicted depressive symptoms in young adulthood. Depressive symptoms were not predictive of later suicide ideation nor attempts. Working memory was associated with lower depressive symptoms. Higher verbal ability was associated with more suicidal thoughts but not attempts. Internal locus of control was associated with decreased depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts/attempts in young adulthood. Findings suggest that cognitive control capacities developed in adolescence differentially predict depressive symptoms, suicidal thoughts, and suicide attempts in young adulthood.

AB The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with complete mental health among Canadians who had ever seriously considered suicide. Data for this study were obtained from Statistics Canada's 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health (N = 2,844). The outcome variable examined in this study was complete mental health and was analyzed using binary logistic regression. Of the 2,844 respondents with lifetime suicidal ideation, 1,088 (38.2%) had complete mental health (i.e., had flourishing mental health, no mental illness, and no suicidal ideation in the past 12 months). Those who had a confidant were seven times more likely to have complete mental health. Other factors associated with achieving complete mental health among formerly suicidal respondents include being older, being a woman, having higher income, use of religious coping, and never previously having a mental illness. Considering the importance of these protective factors in formulating public health policies will allow for a more wide-reaching approach to suicide prevention.

AB Purpose: The association between liver enzymes and death from external causes has not been examined. We investigated the association between serum aminotransferase levels and external-cause mortality in a large prospective cohort study.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 142322 subjects of 35-59 years of age who completed baseline examinations in 1990 and 1992 were enrolled. Mortalities were identified using death certificates. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were categorized into quintiles. Sub-distribution hazards ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a competing risks regression model in which deaths from other causes were treated as competing risks.
   Results: Of 8808 deaths, 1111 (12.6%) were due to external causes. Injury accounted for 256 deaths, and suicide accounted for 255. After adjusting for covariates, elevated ALT and AST were significantly associated with an increased risk of all external-cause mortalities, as well as suicide and injury. Sub-distribution hazards ratios (95% CIs) of the highest versus the lowest quintiles of serum ALT and AST were, respectively, 1.57(1.26-1.95) and 1.45 (1.20-1.76) for all external causes, 2.73 (1.68-4.46) and 1.75 (1.15-2.66) for suicide, and 1.79 (1.10-2.90) and 1.85 (1.21-2.82) for injury. The risk of external-cause mortality was also significantly higher in the fourth quintile of ALT (21.6-27.5 IU/L) than in its first quintile.
   Conclusion: Elevated aminotransferase levels, even within the normal range, were significantly associated with increased risk of all external-cause mortalities, including suicide, and injury.

AB The association of alcohol dependence with suicidal behaviour is well established although complex. On the basis of epidemiological and clinical evidence, alcohol dependence is known to increase the risk for suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and completed suicide. However, this risk is modulated by a wide variety of factors including sociodemographic, clinical, treatment-related and life situational characteristics as well as current drinking status and the effect of inebriation. Treatment and management of patients with alcohol dependence and concomitant suicidal communication or suicide attempts is crucial, as is the recognition of these patients in emergency and other healthcare service contacts. The treatment strategies cannot be based on evidence derived from randomised clinical trials as such data do not exist. They must rather be based on current knowledge of risk factors for suicidal behaviour, efficacy of treatment for alcohol dependence or relevant co-morbid conditions and problems known to be common in treatment settings. In this article, we review the essential literature on the epidemiological and clinical research in the areas of alcohol dependence and suicidal behaviour.
   On the basis of current data and clinical experience, we suggest the following principles be followed in the management of alcohol-dependent individuals: (i) suicidal threats or communication by alcohol-dependent individuals in emergency and other contacts should be taken seriously; (ii) other mental disorders should be well evaluated, a consequent treatment plan initiated and follow-up arranged; (iii) appropriate and up-to-date pharmacological treatment should focus on both reducing the amount of drinking and treating symptoms of other mental disorders; (iv) psychotherapeutic efforts should be focused on emerging symptoms of both alcohol use and other mental disorders; and (v) known epidemiological and clinical risk factors, adverse life events in particular, should be recognised and taken into account.

ID SOCIAL MEDIA
AB Background: In 2016, 44,965 people in the United States died by suicide. It is common to see people with suicidal ideation seek help or leave suicide notes on social media before attempting suicide. Many prefer to express their feelings with longer passages on forums such as Reddit and blogs. Because these expressive posts follow regular language patterns, potential suicide attempts can be prevented by detecting suicidal posts as they are written.
   Objective: This study aims to build a classifier that differentiates suicidal and nonsuicidal forum posts via text mining methods applied on post titles and bodies.
   Methods: A total of 508,398 Reddit posts longer than 100 characters and posted between 2008 and 2016 on SuicideWatch, Depression, Anxiety, and ShowerThoughts subreddits were downloaded from the publicly available Reddit dataset. Of these, 10,785 posts were randomly selected and 785 were manually annotated as suicidal or nonsuicidal. Features were extracted using term frequency-inverse document frequency, linguistic inquiry and word count, and sentiment analysis on post titles and bodies. Logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithms were applied on resulting corpus and prediction performance is evaluated.
   Results: The logistic regression and SVM classifiers correctly identified suicidality of posts with 80% to 92% accuracy and F1 score, respectively, depending on different data compositions closely followed by random forest, compared to baseline ZeroR algorithm achieving 50% accuracy and 66% F1 score.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated that it is possible to detect people with suicidal ideation on online forums with high accuracy. The logistic regression classifier in this study can potentially be embedded on blogs and forums to make the decision to offer real-time online counseling in case a suicidal post is being written.

AB Aesthetic surgery is an essential component of plastic surgery and has become increasingly popular in American society. In 2002, 1.8 million surgical cosmetic procedures were performed in the United States, representing a 294 percent increase from 1992. The 1992 U.S. Food and Drug Administration moratorium on silicone breast implants arose in response to numerous reports of connective tissue disease associated with silicone gel breast augmentation and has led to a decade-long battle over the safety of silicone breast implants that continues today. Numerous scientific and epidemiologic studies of the past decade have established that there is no association between silicone breast prostheses and systemic disease. Recently, a new front has opened in the conflict regarding the safety of breast augmentation: the psychological impact of breast augmentation. Quality studies assessing the psychological characteristics of breast augmentation patients and the psychological impact of breast augmentation surgery are few and most studies are flawed in their methods. Recent reports have provided corroborating evidence to support the psychological benefits of cosmetic surgery and breast augmentation. New reports citing an increased risk for suicide among women with breast implants have brought renewed concerns but are unable to demonstrate a cause-and-effect relationship between breast implants and suicide. The present challenge is to determine whether the increased risk reported in epidemiologic studies is falsely associated with breast implants or whether it represents underlying risk factors or psychopathology in women undergoing breast augmentation that puts them at increased risk for suicide. The purpose of this article is to review the literature regarding the psychological impact of breast augmentation and assesses current scientific findings, with emphasis on the validity of suicide risk in breast augmentation patients.

AB The aim of this article is to conduct a critical analysis of existing family violence literature related to elder abuse homicide, also known as "eldercide." The focus relates to fatal violence perpetrated by current or former intimates. Men are the most likely victims of homicide but are rarely murdered by partners. Older women are most often killed in the home by a spouse or other family, consistent-with the notion of "femicide." The Federal Bureau of Investigation Supplemental Homicide Reports and the Bureau of Justice Statistics National Crime Victimization Survey are utilized to illustrate trends by sex over time. Intimate partner homicide-suicide is examined via news surveillance. Strengths and limitations of data and methods are addressed. Homicide trends among the members of the baby boom cohort are predicted based on current and future patterns as they age. To facilitate prevention, researchers are encouraged to move beyond simple prevalence estimates toward greater understanding of complex trends, distinctions, and motivations of these violent deaths.

AB Self-injury is a dangerous behavior that is different from suicidal behavior but is associated with increased risk of suicide attempts. Some effective psychological treatments for self-injury exist. Physicians in family medicine and primary care settings play a vital role as a first step in the treatment process for those who self-injure. Physicians can enhance the care provided to those who self-injure via the accurate assessment of risk, the understanding of the functions of the behavior, assisting the patient in identifying motivations for treatment and treatment options, and provision of long-term behavioral and risk monitoring. This article summarizes the current scientific knowledge regarding the clinical features, epidemiology, assessment methods, and existing treatments of self-injury. The role of the primary care physician in the treatment of patients who self-injure is specifically outlined. (J Am Board Fam Med 2010;23:240-259.)

AB Among the 1.4 million active duty U.S. military service members, 6% receive outpatient treatment for a mental disorder each year. Over 25% of these service members leave military service within 6 months, a rate that is more than two times higher than the rate following treatment for any other illness category. There is clearly a need to define psychiatric research priorities and an unprecedented opportunity to enhance the field of psychiatric research in general using the well-characterized military population. The first priority is to better define the burden of mental disorders in terms of incidence, prevalence, severity, risk factors, and health care use. The impact of mental disorders on occupational functioning, particularly among new recruits, needs to be better characterized. Suicide research should include efforts to validate mortality data, define the normal level of rate variability, and establish surveillance for clusters. The highly structured occupational environment of the military lends itself to studies of preventive interventions designed to reduce disability or occupational attrition resulting from mental/behavioral problems.

AB In recent years, drug regulation agencies from the US and the UK have issued warnings concerning the emergence of suicidal behavior in children and adolescents treated with antidepressants. As suicidal behavior is the most feared of the core symptoms of depression, these warnings were naturally met with great concern by mental health care technicians and afflicted patients and families.
   In this article we have conducted a review of the literature discussing the controversy that originated in 2003 with the reanalysis of data from clinical trials with selective serotonine reuptake inhibitors. Following our review of meta-analyses, observational studies and ecological studies, we found that SSRIs show some efficacy and are generally safe in the treatment of adolescent depressive disease, provided that the clinical decision to prescribe them is properly weighed and discussed. We make some clinical recommendations, underscoring that adolescents who are medicated with antidepressants must be carefully monitored with regard to suicidal behavior and eventual adverse effects.

AB BackgroundDiabetic patients, during the course of the disease, are most likely to experience depressive symptoms that might ultimately lead to suicidal ideation or suicide. The size of literature in diabetes depression/suicide is a good indicator of national and international efforts to address psychological co-morbidities associated with diabetes mellitus (DM). Therefore, the objective of this study was to give a comprehensive analysis, both quantitative and qualitative, of scientific literature in diabetes depression/suicide.MethodsSciVerse Scopus was used to retrieve relevant literature up to 2016.ResultsIn total, 1664 journal documents were retrieved with an average of 26.9 citations per article and an h-index of 98. Publications started in 1949 but showed a steep and noticeable increase after 2001. Retrieved articles were published in 641 different journals with Diabetes Care journal being the top productive one with a total of 130 (7.8%) articles. Researchers from 83 different countries participated in retrieved publications. Researchers from the United States of America participated in publishing 685 articles. There was a strong and positive correlation between research output and Gross Domestic Product (r=0.083; p<0.001) but not with prevalence or mortality caused by DM. Researchers from 4870 different institutions/organizations participated in publishing retrieved articles. Publications from the University of Washington, Seattle, USA had the highest h-index (38), while VA medical centers had the highest number of publications (75; 4.5%). In total, 5715 authors appeared in retrieved articles giving an average of 3.4 authors per article. Top cited articles focused on prevalence, impact of depression on glycemic control, and potential risk of diabetic complications. The total number of publications in depression/suicide in diabetic patients was lesser than that in cardiac (1938) or in cancer (1828) patients. However, publications in diabetes depression/suicide exceeded those in cardiac and cancer in the last 2years of the study period.ConclusionThe current study showed a noticeable growth of publications indicative of the importance of this topic. Research focusing on the psychiatric component of diabetes mellitus needs to be strengthened and encouraged. At the practical level, screening for depression/suicide among patients attending primary healthcare clinics is needed to optimize health and quality of life of diabetic patients.

AB Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) is a serious and relatively common psychiatric disorder, yet remains understudied among the personality disorders. The current study examines the psychiatric correlates of SPD in a representative epidemiologic sample, utilizing data from the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (N = 34,653). Multiple logistic regression compared people with SPD to the general population across a broad range of childhood adversities, comorbid psychiatric disorders, and suicidal behavior. SPD was strongly associated with many adverse childhood experiences. After adjusting for confounding factors, SPD was independently associated with major depression and several anxiety disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder. Interestingly, SPD was more strongly associated with borderline and narcissistic personality disorders than cluster A personality disorders. Individuals with SPD were also more likely to attempt suicide. As a whole, these results suggest that individuals with SPD experience significant morbidity and may be at increased risk of mortality.

AB Controversy exists about the role of mental disorders in the consistently documented association between smoking and suicidal behavior. This controversy is addressed here with data from the nationally representative National Comorbidity Survey-Replication (NCS-R). Assessments were made of 12-month smoking, suicidal behaviors (ideation, plans, attempts), and DSM-IV disorders (anxiety, mood, impulse-control, and substance use disorders). Statistically significant odds ratios (2.9 -3.1) were found between 12-month smoking and 12-month suicidal behaviors. However, the associations of smoking with the outcomes became insignificant with controls for DSM-IV mental disorders. Although clear adjudication among contending hypotheses about causal mechanisms cannot be made from the cross-sectional NCS-R data, the results make it clear that future research on smoking and suicidal behaviors should focus more centrally than previous research on mental disorders either as common causes, markers, or mediators.

AB Objectives. This study examined the contribution of socioeconomic status (SES) to the risk of injury mortality and morbidity among working-age adults.
   Methods. The sample consisted of respondents to the National Health Interview Survey (1987-1994), and separate analyses were conducted for injury deaths to respondents by linking: tct the National Death Index. Proportional hazards regression models were used to analyze mortality. Logistic regression models Were used to analyze morbidity
   Results. The effects of SES varied substantially by cause of injury mortality and indicator of SES. In the multi-variate models, blue-collar workers were at significantly increased odds nonfatal injury. Education was unrelated to total injury morbidity, although associations were observed after stratification of the outcome by severity and place of occurrence. slack persons were at increased risk for homicide, and Black and Hispanic persons were at decreased risk for suicide and nonfatal injuries, after adjustment for SES.
   Conclusions. SES is an important determinant of injury, although the effect depends on the indicator of SES and the cause and severity of injury.

AB Background: Guided by an ecological systems theory (EST) framework, the purpose of the present study was to investigate how multiple micro, mezzo, and macro factors influence the suicidality continuum from suicidal ideation to suicide attempt among Latinx LGB (lesbian, gay, and bisexual) youth living in the United States.
   Methods: Data for this cross sectional-study included 451 participants who self-identified as Latinx LGB on the 2017-National Youth Risk Behavioral Survey. The analysis explored micro, mezzo, and macro-level factors' association with three suicidality outcomes (ideation, planning, and attempt) at the bivariate and multivariate level. Since the outcome variables were dichotomized, univariate logistic regressions and backward elimination logistic regressions were used.
   Results: The most commonly reported suicidal behavior was ideation (n = 173; 40%), followed by planning (n = 150; 34%), and then attempt (n = 64; 21%). Findings from the backward elimination logistic regression on suicidal ideation suggest the best set of independent variables are being bullied at school (odds ratio [OR] = 2.81; CI: 1.61-4.89), experiencing sexual assault (OR = 2.32; CI: 1.32-4.07), experiencing depressive symptoms (OR = 1.99; CI: 1.07-3.69), being cannabis use (OR = 1.76; CI: 1.08-2.89), and being female (OR = 1.72; CI: 1.01-2.93). For suicide planning the model suggested, experiencing depressive symptoms (OR = 3.21; CI: 1.74-5.91), cannabis use (OR = 2.46; CI: 1.49-4.07), being bullied at school (OR = 2.04; CI: 1.17-3.58), and experiencing sexual assault (OR = 1.88; CI: 1.07-3.31) exhibited the strongest relationships. Suicide attempt was significantly associated with cannabis use (OR = 3.12; CI: 1.60-6.08), experiencing depression (OR= 2.89; CI: 1.30-6.43), experiencing sexual assault (OR = 2.77; CI: 1.34-5.71), and being bullied at school (OR = 2.34; CI: 1.12-4.91).
   Conclusion: Given the findings of this study, it is essential that tailored suicide prevention efforts be established that uniquely address the intersections of race/ethnicity and sexual orientation and how this intersection influences micro, mezzo, and macro factors associated with suicide ideation, planning, and attempt among Latinx LGB adolescents.

AB Data from 231 adolescents (mean age = 15.7, SD = 1.39) were collected from a public school setting in the United States. Participants completed several measures, including those assessing depression, hopelessness, past suicidal behavior, body image, and current suicidal ideation. It was hypothesized that depression, hopelessness, past suicidal behavior, and body image (a risk factor seldom examined) would significantly predict current suicidal ideation and that there would be gender differences for body image. Regression analyses indicated that all risk factors including body image were significant predictors of current suicidal ideation for the whole sample. For both males and females, body image offered a unique contribution to the measurement of suicide ideation above and beyond the other risk factors, with body attitudes/feelings being the strongest predictor. Results encourage the inclusion of body image as a variable in risk models for adolescent suicidal ideation, as it likely accounts for additional variance above and beyond traditional risk factors.

AB Two of every three American homicide victims are killed with firearms, yet little is known about the role played by household firearms in homicide victimization. The present study is the first to examine the cross sectional association between household firearm ownership and homicide victimization across the 50 US states, by age and gender, using nationally representative state-level survey-based estimates of household firearm ownership. Household firearm prevalence for each of the 50 states was obtained from the 2001 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Homicide mortality data for each state were aggregated over the three-year study period, 2001-2003. Analyses controlled for state-level rates of aggravated assault, robbery, unemployment, urbanization, per capita alcohol consumption, and a resource deprivation index (a construct that includes median family income, the percentage of families living beneath the poverty line, the Gim index of family income inequality, the percentage of the population that is black and the percentage of families headed by a single female parent). Multivariate analyses found that states with higher rates of household firearm ownership had significantly higher homicide victimization rates of men, women and children. The association between firearm prevalence and homicide victimization in our study was driven by gun-related homicide victimization rates; non-gun-related victimization rates were not significantly associated with rates of firearm ownership. Although causal inference is not warranted on the basis of the present study alone, our findings suggest that the household may be an important source of firearms used to kill men, women and children in the United States.

AB Problem/Condition: In 2014, approximately 59,000 persons died in the United States as a result of violence-related injuries. This report summarizes data from CDC's National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) regarding violent deaths from 18 U.S. states for 2014. Results are reported by sex, age group, race/ethnicity, marital status, location of injury, method of injury, circumstances of injury, and other selected characteristics.
   Reporting Period Covered: 2014.
   Description of System: NVDRS collects data from participating states regarding violent deaths. Data are obtained from death certificates, coroner/medical examiner reports, law enforcement reports, and secondary sources (e.g., child fatality review team data, supplemental homicide reports, hospital data, and crime laboratory data). This report includes data from 18 states that collected statewide data for 2014 (Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin). NVDRS collates documents for each death and links deaths that are related (e.g., multiple homicides, a homicide followed by a suicide, or multiple suicides) into a single incident.
   Results: For 2014, a total of 22,098 fatal incidents involving 22,618 deaths were captured by NVDRS in the 18 states included in this report. The majority of deaths were suicides (65.6%), followed by homicides (22.5%), deaths of undetermined intent (10.0%), deaths involving legal intervention (1.3%) (i.e., deaths caused by law enforcement and other persons with legal authority to use deadly force, excluding legal executions), and unintentional firearm deaths (< 1%). The term "legal intervention" is a classification incorporated into the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) and does not denote the lawfulness or legality of the circumstances surrounding a death caused by law enforcement. Suicides occurred at higher rates among males, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives (AI/AN), non-Hispanic whites, persons aged 45-54 years, and males aged = 75 years. Suicides were preceded primarily by a mental health, intimate partner, substance abuse, or physical health problem or a crisis during the previous or upcoming 2 weeks. Homicide rates were higher among males and persons aged < 1 year and 15-44 years; rates were highest among non-Hispanic black and AI/AN males. Homicides primarily were precipitated by arguments and interpersonal conflicts, occurrence in conjunction with another crime, or related to intimate partner violence (particularly for females). When the relationship between a homicide victim and a suspected perpetrator was known, it was most often either an acquaintance/ friend or an intimate partner. Legal intervention death rates were highest among males and persons aged 20-44 years; rates were highest among non-Hispanic black males and Hispanic males. Precipitating factors for the majority of legal intervention deaths were alleged criminal activity in progress, the victim reportedly using a weapon in the incident, a mental health or substance abuse problem, an argument or conflict, or a recent crisis. Deaths of undetermined intent occurred more frequently among males, particularly non-Hispanic black and AI/AN males, and persons aged 30-54 years. Substance abuse, mental health problems, physical health problems, and a recent crisis were the most common circumstances preceding deaths of undetermined intent. Unintentional firearm deaths were more frequent among males, non-Hispanic whites, and persons aged 10-24 years; these deaths most often occurred while the shooter was playing with a firearm and were most often precipitated by a person unintentionally pulling the trigger or mistakenly thinking the firearm was unloaded.
   Interpretation: This report provides a detailed summary of data from NVDRS for 2014. The results indicate that violent deaths resulting from self-inflicted or interpersonal violence disproportionately affected persons aged < 65 years, males, and certain minority populations. The primary precipitating factors for homicides and suicides were intimate partner problems, interpersonal conflicts, mental health and substance abuse problems, and recent crises.
   Public Health Action: NVDRS data are used to monitor the occurrence of violence-related fatal injuries and assist public health authorities in the development, implementation, and evaluation of programs and policies to reduce and prevent violent deaths. For example, North Carolina VDRS data were used to improve case ascertainment of pregnancy-associated suicides, Wisconsin VDRS data were used to develop the statewide suicide prevention strategy, and Colorado VDRS data were used to develop programs and prevention strategies for suicide among veterans. The continued development and expansion of NVDRS to include all U.S. states, territories, and the District of Columbia are essential to public health efforts to reduce the impact of violence.

AB Problem/Condition: In 2013, more than 57,000 persons died in the United States as a result of violence-related injuries. This report summarizes data from CDC's National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) regarding violent deaths from 17 U.S. states for 2013. Results are reported by sex, age group, race/ethnicity, marital status, location of injury, method of injury, circumstances of injury, and other selected characteristics.
   Reporting Period Covered: 2013.
   Description of System: NVDRS collects data from participating states regarding violent deaths obtained from death certificates, coroner/medical examiner reports, law enforcement reports, and secondary sources (e.g., child fatality review team data, supplemental homicide reports, hospital data, and crime laboratory data). This report includes data from 17 states that collected statewide data for 2013 (Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Carolina, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin). NVDRS collates documents for each death and links deaths that are related (e.g., multiple homicides, a homicide followed by a suicide, or multiple suicides) from a single incident.
   Results: For 2013, a total of 18,765 fatal incidents involving 19,251 deaths were captured by NVDRS in the 17 states included in this report. The majority (66.2%) of deaths were suicides, followed by homicides (23.2%), deaths of undetermined intent (8.8%), deaths involving legal intervention (1.2%) (i.e., deaths caused by law enforcement and other persons with legal authority to use deadly force, excluding legal executions), and unintentional firearm deaths (<1%). (The term legal intervention is a classification incorporated into the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision [ICD-10] and does not denote the lawfulness or legality of the circumstances surrounding a death caused by law enforcement.) Suicides occurred at higher rates among males, non-Hispanic whites, American Indian/Alaska Natives, persons aged 45-64 years, and males aged 75 years. Suicides were preceded primarily by a mental health, intimate partner, or physical health problem or a crisis during the previous or upcoming 2 weeks. Homicide rates were higher among males and persons aged 15-44 years; rates were highest among non-Hispanic black males. Homicides primarily were precipitated by arguments and interpersonal conflicts, occurrence in conjunction with another crime, or were related to intimate partner violence (particularly for females). A known relationship between a homicide victim and a suspected perpetrator was most likely either that of an acquaintance or friend or an intimate partner. Legal intervention death rates were highest among males and persons aged 20-24 years and 30-34 years; rates were highest among non-Hispanic black males. Precipitating factors for the majority of legal intervention deaths were another crime, a mental health problem, or a recent crisis. Deaths of undetermined intent occurred at the highest rates among males and persons aged <1 year and 45-54 years. Substance abuse and mental or physical health problems were the most common circumstances preceding deaths of undetermined intent. Unintentional firearm death rates were higher among males, non-Hispanic whites, and persons aged persons aged 15-19 and 55-64 years; these deaths were most often precipitated by a person unintentionally pulling the trigger while playing with a firearm or while hunting.
   Interpretation: This report provides a detailed summary of data from NVDRS for 2013. The results indicate that violent deaths resulting from self-inflicted or interpersonal violence disproportionately affected persons aged <65 years, males, and certain minority populations. For homicides and suicides, intimate partner problems, interpersonal conflicts, mental health problems, and recent crises were primary precipitating factors.
   Public Health Action: NVDRS data are used to monitor the occurrence of violence-related fatal injuries and assist public health authorities in the development, implementation, and evaluation of programs and policies to reduce and prevent violent deaths. For example, Utah Violent Death Reporting System (VDRS) data were used to develop policies that support children of intimate partner homicide victims, Colorado VDRS data to develop a web-based suicide prevention program targeting middle-aged men, and Rhode Island VDRS data to help guide suicide prevention efforts at workplaces. The continued development and expansion of NVDRS to include all U.S. states, territories, and the District of Columbia are essential to public health efforts to reduce the impact of violence.

AB Objectives: Opioid-related mortality has increased in the United States in the past decade. The purpose of this study was to examine trends and regional variation in opioid prescribing and overdose rates in a national health system, the Veterans Health Administration.
   Materials and Methods: Annual cohorts of Veterans Health Administration patients were identified on the basis of medical records, and overdose mortality was determined from National Death Index records. State-level prescribing and overdose rates were mapped to provide information on regional variability.
   Results: There were significant increases between 2001 and 2009 in the rate of overdoses associated with nonsynthetic opioids (beta = 0.53, 95% confidence interval, 0.35, 0.70) and methadone (beta = 0.63, 95% confidence interval, 0.37, 0.90) but not synthetic/semisynthetic opioids. State-level overdose rates had a moderate correlation with the average proportion of patients in that state receiving opioids (r = 0.29).
   Discussion: The present study demonstrates that the increases in prescription opioid overdoses observed in the general population are also found in the patient population of a national health system and provides further evidence of the population-level association between trends in opioid prescribing and opioid overdose deaths. There is substantial regional variation in both opioid prescribing and opioid-related overdose rates, and these data can inform region-specific overdose prevention strategies and opioid policy.

AB Suicide rates have increased over the past several decades. Prior research has evaluated risk factors for suicidal behavior, but much of this work does not adequately differentiate between risk factors for suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts, nor does it differentiate between first-onset SI and recurrent ideation. This study seeks to identify risk factors for first-onset SI among a high-risk group: individuals receiving treatment for substance use disorders. Data were drawn from the National Treatment Improvement Evaluation Study, a prospective study examining the impact of addiction treatment programs. Patients with no lifetime history of suicide attempts or ideation (n = 2560) were assessed at baseline and one year later for prospectively-occurring SI. Sociodemographic variables, mental health indices, interpersonal factors, and substance use severity indicators were evaluated as prospective predictors of first-onset SI in linear regression models. Current mental health problems (OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.19-2.01), current substance use problems (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.04-1.70), and difficulty accessing treatment for substance use problems (OR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.16-3.11) emerged as significant predictors of first-onset SI in a multivariate analysis, suggesting that individuals with current mental health or substance use related symptoms are among the most at risk for developing SI. Difficulty obtaining treatment remained significant, highlighting the importance of treatment accessibility. Future clinical work and research would benefit by addressing these issues, potentially by focusing on mental health treatment in substance abuse programs and evaluating barriers to treatment.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify circumstances and characteristics of suicidal behavior among early (aged 10-14 years) and late (aged 15-18 years) adolescents from a cohort of youth who were prescribed antidepressant medication.
   METHODS: In-depth reviews of all available medical records were performed for 250 randomly chosen confirmed episodes of suicidal behavior identified as part of a large retrospective cohort study of antidepressant users and suicidal behavior. Study data were obtained from Tennessee Medicaid records and death certificates from January 1, 1995, to December 31, 2006. Medical records and autopsy reports for cases identified from electronic data were adjudicated by 2 investigators blinded to exposure status and classified by using a validated scale.
   RESULTS: Of the 250 cases reviewed, 65.6% were female and 26.4% were aged 10 to 14 years. Medication ingestion was the most frequent method of suicidal behavior for both early and late adolescents; however, early adolescents were significantly more likely to use hanging as a method of suicide. Nearly one-half of the adolescents had previously attempted suicide. Early adolescents were significantly more likely to have a history of sexual abuse and significantly less likely to have a history of substance abuse. Early adolescents were also significantly more likely than older adolescents to have a history of a psychotic disorder and to report hallucinations before the suicide attempt.
   CONCLUSION: Suicidal behavior among early and late adolescents prescribed antidepressant medication differed in terms of methods used, previous psychiatric history, and proximal symptoms. Pediatrics 2011; 128: 447-454

   stress disorder; suicide

AB Rationale: Benzodiazepines are associated with mortality and poor outcomes among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but use of benzodiazepines for dyspnea among patients with end-stage disease may confound this relationship.
   Objectives: Assess the mortality risks of long-term benzodiazepine exposure among patients with COPD and comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), patients with chronic nonrespiratory indications for benzodiazepines.
   Methods: We identified all patients with COPD and PTSD within the Veteran's Health Administration between 2010 and 2012. We calculated propensity scores for benzodiazepine use and compared overall and cause-specific mortality of patients with long-term (>= 90 d) benzodiazepine use relative to matched patients without use. Secondary analyses assessed propensity-adjusted survival by characteristics of benzodiazepine exposure.
   Results: Among 44,555 eligible patients with COPD and PTSD, 23.6% received benzodiazepines long term. In the matched sample of 19,552 patients, we observed no mortality difference (hazard ratio [HR] for long-term use, 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95-1.18) but greater risk of death by suicide among those with long-term use (HR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.14-4.79). Among matched and unmatched patients, short-term benzodiazepine use, but not long-term use, was associated with increased mortality (short-term: HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05-1.28; long-term: HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.94-1.13).
   Conclusions: Risks for respiratory compromise related to long-term benzodiazepine use in COPD may be less than previously estimated, but short-term use of benzodiazepines could still pose a mortality risk. Suicide associated with benzodiazepine use in this population warrants further investigation.

AB Background: The purpose of this study is to characterize traumatic suicide attempts (TSA) by age, gender, race, and mechanism of injury. Methods: This is a retrospective review of TSA patients (identified by E-codes) admitted to our urban, level I trauma center from 1992 through 2005. Mechanisms of TSA included jump from height, firearm (gunshot wound [GSW]), cutting or piercing instrument (stab wound [SW]), and motor vehicle (MV)-related. Patients were categorized in groups by age in years (< 18, 18-35, 36-54, 55-69, >= 70). Results: A total of 876 TSA patients were identified; 83% were male, with a mean age of 35 years and a mean Injury Severity Score of 10. The most common mechanism was SW (39%), followed by jump (26%), GSW (21%), and MV-related (13%). Primary mechanism of TSA varied by age (p < 0.0001), with GSW most common in those patients aged < 18 years (64%) and >= 70 years (44%), and SW most common in all other age groups. Overall, 16% of TSAs were successful. The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for mortality for age 70+ vs. age 36-54 was 12.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3-78,p = 0.005), and the AOR for mortality from GSW vs. SW was 9.8 (95% CI 2.6-44, p = 0.001). Conclusions: The most common mechanism for TSA was SW, although GSW was the most effective. The mechanism of choice for TSA depends on age, with the extremes of age more commonly choosing a firearm. Age and method of TSA are significant contributing factors to success of suicide attempts. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

TI Lifetime Prevalence of Suicide Attempts Among Sexual Minority Adults by
   Study Sampling Strategies: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Review
ID MENTAL-HEALTH; BISEXUAL MEN; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; RISK-FACTORS; GAY
   MEN; ORIENTATION; POPULATION; IDEATION; PARTNERS; GENDER
AB Background. Previous reviews have demonstrated a higher risk of suicide attempts for lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) persons (sexual minorities), compared with heterosexual groups, but these were restricted to general population studies, thereby excluding individuals sampled through LGB community venues. Each sampling strategy, however, has particular methodological strengths and limitations. For instance, general population probability studies have defined sampling frames but are prone to information bias associated with underreporting of LGB identities. By contrast, LGB community surveys may support disclosure of sexuality but overrepresent individuals with strong LGB community attachment.
   Objectives. To reassess the burden of suicide-related behavior among LGB adults, directly comparing estimates derived from population-versus LGB community-based samples.
   Search methods. In 2014, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and Scopus databases for articles addressing suicide-related behavior (ideation, attempts) among sexual minorities.
   Selection criteria. We selected quantitative studies of sexual minority adults conducted in nonclinical settings in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
   Data collection and analysis. Random effects meta-analysis and meta-regression assessed for a difference in prevalence of suicide-related behavior by sample type, adjusted for study or sample-level variables, including context (year, country), methods (medium, response rate), and subgroup characteristics (age, gender, sexual minority construct). We examined residual heterogeneity by using tau(2).
   Main results. We pooled 30 cross-sectional studies, including 21 201 sexual minority adults, generating the following lifetime prevalence estimates of suicide attempts: 4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3%, 5%) for heterosexual respondents to population surveys, 11% (95% CI = 8%, 15%) for LGB respondents to population surveys, and 20% (95% CI = 18%, 22%) for LGB respondents to community surveys (Figure 1). The difference in LGB estimates by sample type persisted after we accounted for covariates with meta-regression. Sample type explained 33% of the between-study variability.
   Author's conclusions. Regardless of sample type examined, sexual minorities had a higher lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts than heterosexual persons; however, the magnitude of this disparity was contingent upon sample type. Community-based surveys of LGB people suggest that 20% of sexual minority adults have attempted suicide.
   Public health implications. Accurate estimates of sexual minority health disparities are necessary for public health monitoring and research. Most data describing these disparities are derived from 2 sample types, which yield different estimates of the lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts. Additional studies should explore the differential effects of selection and information biases on the 2 predominant sampling approaches used to understand sexual minority health.

AB Objective: Asthma and psychosocial stressors are common among Puerto Rican adults living in the United States. We estimated the prevalence of current asthma, and examined potential psychosocial risk factors and current asthma, among adults in Puerto Rico. Methods: Cross-sectional study of 3,049 Puerto Ricans aged 18-64 years living in Puerto Rico between May 2014 and June 2016. A structured interview was conducted to obtain information on demographics, lifestyle, mental disorders, and respiratory health. Current asthma was defined as self-reported physician-diagnosed asthma and still having asthma. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine psychosocial risk factors and current asthma. Results: The estimated prevalence of current asthma was 10.2%. In a multivariable analysis, exposure to violence (odds ratio [OR] for each 1-point increment in a validated scale = 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07 to 1.21) and a lifetime history of at least one suicide attempt (OR = 3.01, 95% CI = 1.80 to 5.01) were significantly associated with current asthma, independently of major depressive disorder. Moreover, a lifetime history of at least one suicide attempt was associated with co-existing asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (i.e., asthma-COPD overlap syndrome or ACOS (OR = 9.05, 95% CI = 3.32-24.67). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that asthma is a major health problem among adults in Puerto Rico, with psychosocial risk factors playing a significant role in asthma and ACOS. Addressing chronic stressors and mental illness should be part of comprehensive strategies to reduce asthma burden in this population.

AB Background: Self-immolation (SI) is considered one of the most painful, dramatic, and at the same time most inexplicable methods of suicide, with a high social impact. Prevalence rates are particularly high in Iran, and in north-western Iran specifically. Here, we report sociodemographic, psychological, and psychiatric characteristics of patients attempting self-immolation (PSIs), compared to patients with accident burns (PABs). Method: Patients referred to the Burns Emergency Unit of the Besat Hospital (Hamadan, Iran) were enrolled in the present study between winter 2015 and summer 2016. After burn-related treatments and surgery, a thorough interview was undertaken covering sociodemographic characteristics, burn-related information, and psychiatric background. Results: A total of 79 patients were enrolled. Among these, 19 (31.7%) had attempted suicide via SI. Compared to the PABs, the PS's were predominantly females; they reported family and marital problems as the main triggers for SI. The psychiatric interviews indi- cated that PSIS often suffered from major depressive disorders, adjustment disorders, and bipolar disorders. The prevailing feelings reported were guilt and shame. A binary logistic regression showed that feelings of guilt and marital and family problems predicted SI. Conclusions: The prevalence of SI was surprisingly high. Marital and family conflicts as a proxy for highly distressing social interactions, along with female gender and feelings of guilt and shame were strongly associated with SI. Family and couple counseling specifically tailored to difficulties experienced by women might reduce the risk of SI. (C) 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Objective: To assess national trends in hospital-treated self-harm events focusing on adults aged 45-64 years.
   Method: Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project data from 2001 (N=7,452,727) to 2011 (N=7,893,587) were used to assess national trends in hospital stays for suicide and self-inflicted injury among youth (0-24 years), young adults (35-44 years), middle-aged adults (45-64 years) and older adults (>= 65 years).
   Results: Among middle-aged adults, hospital-treated self-harm events increased from 5.1 (2001) to 7.1 (2011) per 10,000 population (OR=1.4, 95% CI=1.2, 1.6). This increase was larger than corresponding changes among youth (5.2-4.9) (interaction P=. 0003), young adults (10.0-10.6) (interaction P=. 006) or older adults (2.2-2.4) (interaction P=. 07). Among middle-aged adults, hospital-treated self-harm events per 100 hospital discharges significantly increased (OR=1.4, 95% CI=1.3, 1.6), but there was not a significant increase in self-harm discharges per 100 mental disorder discharges (OR=1.2, 95% CI=1.0, 1.4).
   Conclusions: Between 2001 and 2011, there was a disproportionate national increase in hospital-treated self-harm events among middle-aged adults that mirrored national trends in suicide. Because the increase was largely accounted for by an overall increase in mental health hospitalizations of middle-aged adults, the rising rate of hospital-treated self-harm events may reflect broader population-based mental health challenges facing US middle-aged adults.

AB Introduction: This systematic review assessed the impact of race/ethnicity, education, and income on transgender individual's lifetime experience of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (SITB) in gray and published literature (1997-2017). Methods: Sixty four research projects (108 articles) were identified in WorldCat, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Articles were included if they were published in Canada or the United States, included original quantifiable data on transgender SITBs, and had >= 5 participants, at least 51% of whom were >= 18 years. Results: Across all projects suicide ideation averaged 46.55% and attempts averaged 27.19%. The majority of participants were Caucasian, whereas the highest rate of suicide attempts (55.31%) was among First Nations, who accounted for <1.5% of participants. Caucasians, by contrast, had the lowest attempt rate (36.80%). More participants obtained a bachelor's degree and fewer an associate or technical degree than any other level of education. Suicide attempts were highest among those with <= some high school (50.70%) and lowest among those with an advanced degree (30.25%). More participants made an income of $20-$50,000/year and less $10-$20,000 than any other income bracket. Conclusion: SITBs, among the transgender population, are both universally high and impacted by race/ethnicity, educational attainment, and income. These findings may be useful in creating culturally and factually informed interventions for transgender individuals experiencing SITBs and in informing future research on this topic.

AB Objective: U.S. Army personnel experience a significant mental health burden, particularly during times of war and multiple deployments. This study identified rates of suicidality (seriously considering or attempting suicide) and types of mental health services used in the past 12 months by active duty Army soldiers. Methods: This study used the 2008 Department of Defense Survey of Health Related Behaviors Among Active Duty Military Personnel, which sampled 10,400 Army soldiers from a total population of 508,088 soldiers. Mental health service utilization included receiving counseling or therapy from a general medical doctor, receiving counseling or therapy from a mental health professional, and being prescribed medications for depression, anxiety, or sleep. Suicidally was assessed via self-report questions. Results: Thirteen percent had seriously considered or attempted suicide at some point in their lives, 7% since joining the military. One percent who reported suicidality since joining the Army reported having considered or attempted suicide in the past year. After the analyses adjusted for sociodemographic factors, soldiers who seriously considered or attempted suicide since joining the military versus those who did not were 1.71 times more likely to have used a mental health service, 2.33 times more likely to have used two or more types of services, 1.82 times more likely to have seen a mental health specialist, and 1.67 times more likely to have received medication in the past year. Conclusions: Understanding the relationship between suicidal thoughts and behaviors and the specific levels and types of mental health services received in this military population is important for health care provision and planning.

AB Objective. To report on the epidemiology of schizophrenia and other common mental health disorders in the English-speaking Caribbean.
   Methods. The MEDLINE, MEDCARIB and West Indiana electronic databases were searched with the phrases Caribbean AND psychiatry OR mental OR suicide, and items with specific reference to epidemiology were culled and reviewed.
   Results. The age-corrected incidence rate for schizophrenia per 10 000 is 2.09 in Jamaica, 2.2 per 1000 in Trinidad, and 2.92 in Barbados. These rates are lower than the incidence rates reported for white British people, and significantly lower that the 6- to 18-fold higher risk ratio incidence reported for African Caribbeans living in Britain. A comparative diagnostic study carried out in the United Kingdom (UK) suggests that misdiagnosis plays a significant role in this difference. Relatively low incidence figures for affective disorders, anxiety states, suicide and attempted suicide have been reported for Jamaica, Trinidad, and Barbados.
   Discussion. Most published epidemiological studies of Caribbean populations center on schizophrenia, because of the startling findings of a large increase in risk ratios for African Caribbean people living in England compared to the white native British people. The etiological evidence is shifting toward factors of racism and social alienation experienced by black people in the UK, and to misdiagnosis by white British psychiatrists. Studies of the role of colonial enslavement and social engineering raise the etiological possibility of a role for social and structural community organization in the genesis of schizophrenia. The Caribbean thus represents a rich crucible for research in the epidemiology and etiology of mental health disorders.

AB Objective To determine the prevalence and correlates associated with sedative use and misuse in the general population.
   Method Data were drawn front the National Comobidity Survey (n = 8098), a representative sample of adults in the community. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify correlates of sedative use, non-prescription use and self-perceived dependence.
   Results The life-time prevalence of self-perceived sedative dependence was 0.5%, 7.1'% reported non-prescribed sedative use and 17.0% had been prescribed sedatives and denied misuse. Individuals who used sedatives without a prescription were more likely to be mate (OR = 0.61 (0.44, 0.86)), have lower income (OR = 0.71 (0.54, 0.94)), more education (OR = 1.51, (1.17, 1.96)), major depression (OR = 1.47 (1.04, 2.08)), agoraphobia (OR 1.59 l 2.32)), ASPD (OR = 5.29 (3.42, 8.20)) and suicide ideation (OR 1.91 (1.23, 2.94)), compared with those who did not use sedatives. Individuals with self-perceived dependence on sedatives were older (OR = 1.05 (1.02, 1.08)), had less education (OR = 0.2 (0.1, 0.7)) and were more likely to have a parent who abused prescription medications (OR = 4.3 (1.03, 18.03)), compared with those without sedative dependence.
   Conclusions Almost one in 10 Adults report misuse of sedatives in their lifetime. Sedative use and misuse arc associated with high levels of psychopathology and suicide risk, and show a specific association with parental abuse of prescription medications in the general population. Future work to understand more effectively the nature of these associations may ultimately lead to improved effectiveness of preventive interventions.

AB Aims: The aims of this study were to investigate the risk of death and time trends from external causes, and to evaluate the significance of the effects of age, period and birth cohort on suicide mortality among middle-aged men during the period 1971 - 2000 in Lithuania. Methods: Random samples of men aged 45 - 59 years from the Kaunas Rotterdam Intervention Study ( conducted in 1972 - 74) and Study of Multifactorial Prevention of CHD ( conducted in 1977 - 80) were examined ( n = 6,480). The participants of the two surveys were observed until 1 January 2001. Over this time 2,841 men had died, 230 of these from external causes. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the risk of death from external causes. Trends in mortality from external causes and average annual changes were based on logarithmic regression analysis. For assessment of the effects of age, period, and birth cohort the Poisson regression model was applied. Results: The risk of mortality from external causes among men was positively related to smoking habits and arterial hypertension and negatively related to education level and total serum cholesterol concentration but there was no association with consumption of alcohol. The risk of suicide mortality was associated with family status and occupation only. Trends in mortality from all external causes showed no significant changes during the period 1971 - 2000. After adjusting for age and cohort effects, the period effect was statistically significant. Conclusion: Prognosis of risk factors for mortality from external causes and period effect on suicide mortality rates will form important parts of future research agendas.

AB The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the type and number of stressful life events (SLEs) will be associated with suicidal behavior in a 3-year follow-up period in persons with major depressive disorder (MDD). Data came from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), a nationally representative longitudinal survey of mental health in non-institutionalized adults in the United States. The survey consisted of two waves: Wave 1 (2001--2002) and Wave 2 (2004-2005), n=34,653. Twelve past-year SLEs were assessed at baseline. These SLEs were categorized into the following groups based on previous research: Loss or victimization; Relationship, friendship, or interpersonal stress; Financial stress; and Legal problems. Only respondents with MDD at Wave 1 were included (n=6,004). Several SLEs were strongly associated with suicide attempts, among which, "serious problems with neighbor, friend, or relative" (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=2.21; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.41, 3.45) and "major financial crisis, bankruptcy, or unable to pay bills" (AOR=2.31; 95% CI: 1.45, 3.66) were the most robust predictors of suicide attempts even after adjusting for sociodemographic variables and any anxiety, substance use, or personality disorder. People with MDD who had been exposed to certain SLEs are at elevated risk for future suicide attempts, even after accounting for the demographic factors and psychiatric comorbidity.

AB Background: In jurisdictions that permit euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide, patients with cancer comprise the largest group to die by these methods. We investigated the personal attitudes toward these practices of patients receiving palliative care for advanced cancer.
   Methods: Seventy patients (32 men and 38 women; median survival, 44.5 days) took part in a survey using in-depth semistructured interviews. The interviews were audiotaped for transcription and content analysis of themes.
   Results: Most participants (73%) believed that euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide should be legalized, citing pain and the individual's right to choose as their major reasons. Participants who were opposed to legalization cited religious and moral objections as their central concerns. Forty (58%) of the 69 participants who completed the entire interview also believed that, if legal, they might personally make a future request for a hastened death, particularly if pain or physical symptoms became intolerable. Eight of these individuals (12%) would have made such a request at the time of the interview. These 8 participants differed from all others on ratings of loss of interest or pleasure in activities, hopelessness, and the desire to die (Ps<.02). They also had a higher prevalence of depressive disorders (P<.05). However, they did not differ on ratings of pain severity.
   Conclusions: Many patients with advanced cancer favor policies that would allow them access to both euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide if pain and physical symptoms became intolerable. For patients who would actually make requests for a physician-hastened death, however, psychological considerations may be at least as salient as physical symptoms.

AB Calls to legalize physician-assisted suicide have increased and public interest in the subject has grown in recent years despite ethical prohibitions. Many people have concerns about how they will die and the emphasis by medicine and society on intervention and cure has sometimes come at the expense of good end-of-life care. Some have advocated strongly, on the basis of autonomy, that physician-assisted suicide should be a legal option at the end of life. As a proponent of patient-centered care, the American College of Physicians (ACP) is attentive to all voices, including those who speak of the desire to control when and how life will end. However, the ACP believes that the ethical arguments against legalizing physician-assisted suicide remain the most compelling. On the basis of substantive ethics, clinical practice, policy, and other concerns articulated in this position paper, the ACP does not support legalization of physician-physician relationship, affects trust in the relationship and in the profession, and fundamentally alters the medical profession's role in society. Furthermore, the principles at stake in this debate also underlie medicine's responsibilities regarding other issues and the physician's duties to provide care based on clinical judgment, evidence, and ethics. Society's focus at the end of life should be on efforts to address suffering and the needs of patients and families, including improving access to effective hospice and palliative care. The ACP remains committed to improving care for patients throughout and at the end of life.

AB Objective: Given that a cohort effect is rarely mentioned as one of the possible contributors to the increased incidence of childhood-onset bipolar disorder in the United States, we reexamined evidence for the phenomenon within our outpatient Bipolar Collaborative Network.
   Methods: 968 outpatients (mean age, 41 years) with DSM bipolar disorder from 1995 to 2002 from 4 sites in the United States and 3 in the Netherlands and Germany (abbreviated as Europe) gave informed consent and provided detailed demographic, illness, and family history information on a patient questionnaire. Family history of bipolar disorder, depression, suicide attempt, alcohol abuse, substance abuse, and "other" illness was collected for each parent and the 4 grandparents. Age at onset and family history of illness burden were then assessed as a function of the age of the patient at network entry.
   Results: Data for patients aged 35 years or older (n = 613) were included in the first analysis. Compared to older patients, those who were younger when they entered the network had an earlier age at onset of their bipolar disorder (r = 0.33, P < .001). Similarly, the youngest patients at entry (representing the most recent cohorts) had parents and grandparents with more psychiatric illness than patients born in earlier cohorts (n = 968).
   Conclusions: These preliminary data, taken with the substantial literature, suggest a cohort effect for earlier age at onset of bipolar disorder and greater burden of psychiatric disorders in 2 generations of direct progenitors of our patients. The resulting likely increase in severity of bipolar illness in future generations based on this earlier age at onset and increased familial loading, particularly in the United States, deserves focused clinical and public health attention and attempts at amelioration.

AB Objective: To longitudinally assess the prevalence of depression and anxiety following carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning and to assess the contributions of mode of poisoning (accidental versus suicide attempt), cognitive sequelae, and oxygen dose (hyperbaric oxygen versus non-nobaric oxygen) to depression and anxiety. of affective morbidity following CO poisoning and remain vigilant about CO prevention.
   Background: CO is the most common cause of poisoning in the United States and may result in neuropathologic changes and cognitive and neurologic sequelae, yet little is known regarding affective outcomes.
   Method: We prospectively assessed affect in 127 CO-poisoned patients. Self-report inventories of depression and anxiety were administered at 6 weeks and at 6 and 12 months post CO poisoning. The primary outcome was prevalence of depression and anxiety at 6 weeks. To determine the effect of mode of poisoning, cognitive sequelae, and oxygen dose, odds ratio estimates were calculated at all three times using logistic regression.
   Results: Depression and anxiety were present in 45% of patients at 6 weeks, 44% at 6 months, and 43% at 12 months. Patients with suicide attempt and cognitive sequelae had higher prevalence of depression and anxiety at 6 weeks. At 12 months, there were no differences in depression or anxiety regardless of mode of poisoning, presence of cognitive sequelae, or oxygen dose.
   Conclusions: CO poisoning results in significant depression and anxiety that persist to at least 12 months. Patients with cognitive sequelae and suicide attempt had a higher rate of depression and anxiety at 6 weeks but not at 12 months. Clinicians need to be aware of affective morbidity following CO poisoning and remain vigilant about CO prevention.

   ONSET
AB OBJECTIVES: Adolescent depression and attempted and completed suicide are increasing in the United States. Because suicide is often impulsive, the means of self-harm are frequently items of convenience like medication. Authors of a recent study compared tricyclic antidepressant overdose to bupropion overdose. Fluoxetine and escitalopram are the only agents with Food and Drug Administration approval for pediatric depression, but off-label bupropion prescriptions are common. We sought to compare the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and bupropion in overdose. METHODS: This was an analysis of the National Poison Data System from June 2013 through December 2017 for adolescent (ages 10-19) exposures to SSRIs or bupropion coded as "suspected suicide." Demographics, clinical effects, therapies, and medical outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 30 026 cases during the study period. Sertraline and fluoxetine accounted for nearly 60%, whereas bupropion was reported in 11.7%. Bupropion exposure was significantly associated with death (0.23% vs 0%; P < .001) or serious outcome (58.1% vs 19%; P < .001) as well as the 10 most common clinical effects, including seizures (27.0% vs 8.5%; P < .001) and hallucinations (28.6% vs 4.3%; P < .001). Bupropion exposure was significantly associated with the need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (0.51% vs 0.01%; P < .001), intubation (4.9% vs 0.3%; P < .001), vasopressors (1.1% vs 0.2%; P < .001), and benzodiazepines (34.2% vs 5.5%; P < .001). There was a significant increase in all exposures and in proportion of serious outcomes over time. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents who attempt self-harm are at higher risk for serious morbidity and poor outcomes with bupropion than with SSRIs. These risks, and the patient's propensity for self-harm, should be evaluated when therapy with bupropion is considered.

AB Background: Low-and-Middle-Income-Countries (LMICs) account for 75% of global suicides. While primary care populations in high-income countries (HIC) typically have higher prevalence of suicidal behavior relative to general populations, few studies have explored suicidal behavior among general medical outpatients in LMICs. This study addresses the research gap by characterizing potential risk factors for suicidal ideation in a large general medical outpatient setting in rural Kenya.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study of adult general medical outpatients attending a rural sub-county hospital in Kaloleni, Kenya. Primary outcomes included major depressive disorder (MDD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicidal behavior measured by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI 5.0). We use binary logistic regression to model suicidality, mental disorders, intimate partner violence, and lifetime abuse.
   Results: 394 outpatients completed the assessment. The prevalence of SI over the past month was 20%. 18% of those with suicidal ideation over the past month also attempted suicide in the past month. Participants who met criteria for MDD (suicidality item removed) were 19 times [CI: 4.56, 79.05] more likely to report suicidal ideation compared to those without MDD (adjusted odds ratio 12.15 [CI: 2.66, 55.49]).
   Limitations: This was a cross sectional study design with convenience sampling and hence vulnerable to selection and recall bias.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of SI and its strong association with actual suicide attempt in this population, make an urgent public health case for intervention. These data identify MDD as a highly significant correlate of SI.

AB Background: Families' experiences of assisted dying are under-investigated and families are rarely considered in clinical guidelines concerning assisted dying. Aim: To systematically review family experiences of assisted dying. Design: A systematic literature review using thematic synthesis. Data sources: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine) and PsycINFO databases (January 1992 to February 2019). Studies investigating families' experiences on the practice of legalised assisted dying were included. We excluded studies prior to legalisation within the jurisdiction, secondary data analysis and opinion papers. Results: Nineteen articles met the inclusion criteria. Publications were derived from four countries: The Netherlands, United States (Oregon, Washington and Vermont), Canada and Switzerland. Dutch studies predominately investigated family involvement in euthanasia, while Swiss and American studies only reported on assisted suicide. Eleven studies had a qualitative design, using predominately in-depth interviews; seven were retrospective surveys. Five analytical themes represented families' experiences in assisted dying: (1) context of the decision, (2) grounding the decision, (3) cognitive and emotional work, (4) experiencing the final farewell and (5) grief and bereavement. The results showed that families can be very involved in supporting patients seeking assisted dying, where open communication is maintained. Family involvement appeared to be influenced by the type of legislation in their country and the families' perception of the social acceptability of assisted dying. Conclusion: Our data confirm that families across all jurisdictions are involved in assisted suicide decision and enactment. Family needs are under-researched, and clinical guidelines should incorporate recommendations about how to consider family needs and how to provide them with evidence-based tailored interventions.

AB Alcohol, primarily in the form of ethyl alcohol (ethanol), has occupied an important place in the history of humankind for at least 8,000 years. In most Western societies, at least 90% of people consume alcohol at some time during their lives, and 30% or more of drinkers develop alcohol-related problems. Severe alcohol-related life impairment, alcohol dependence (alcoholism), is observed at some time during their lives in about 10% of men and 3-5% of women. An additional 5-10% of each sex develops persistent, but less intense, problems that are diagnosed as alcohol abuse. It this review, neurobiological aspects of suicidal behavior in alcoholism is discussed. In individuals with comorbid depression and alcoholism, greater serotonergic impairment may be associated with higher risk of completed suicide. Dopaminergic dysfunction may play an important role in the pathophysiology of suicidal behavior in alcoholism. Brain damage and neurobehavioral deficits are associated with alcohol use disorders and may contribute to suicidal behavior in persons with alcohol dependence or abuse. Aggression/impulsivity and alcoholism severity affect risk for suicide among individuals with alcoholism. Major depressive episodes and stressful life events particularly, partner-relationship disruptions, may precipitate suicidal behavior in individuals with alcohol use disorders. Alcohol misuse and psychosocial adversity can combine to increase stress on the person, and, thereby, potentially, increase the risk for suicidal behavior. The management of suicidal patients with alcohol use disorders is also discussed. It is to be hoped that the efforts of clinicians will reduce morbidity and mortality associated with alcohol misuse.

SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE
LA English
DT Article
ID BUSINESS-CYCLE; UNITED-STATES; UNEMPLOYMENT; SUICIDE
AB Thinking in France on relations between crime rate trend and evolution of socio-economic context over time is underdeveloped. Recent studies in the United Kingdom suggest that the business cycle influences fluctuations in both property offenses and violent crime. Whereas pre-1970 research in the United States only rarely pointed up a direct link between crime rate and unemployment, post-1970 American studies are dominated by demonstrations of a direct correlation between the two. In this article, analysis of trends in unemployment, prices and wages, marriage among men, and schooling leads to an interpretation of delinquency and crime over the long term in which it is affirmed that an increase in opportunity, such as that attested to by increased consumer prices and wages over time, has a more pronounced role in the strong growth period of the cycle and influences property offenses more than violent crime, and that unemployment among young people without educational degrees is a factor working in favor of both theft and violent crime. This phenomenon was partially masked in periods where it was common to remain in the school system, such as early in the last decade of the twentieth century in France. Lastly, the fact that starting in the early 1980s fewer young people settled in couples and, more generally, the tension in relations between the sexes may also have worked to favor delinquency.

AB Background: Although insomnia has been identified as a robust predictor of suicidal ideation and behaviors, little is known about the mechanisms by which sleep disturbances confer risk for suicide. We investigated thwarted belongingness as an explanatory link between insomnia symptoms and suicidal ideation across three military service member and veteran samples.
   Methods: Data were collected among United States military service members and veterans (N-1=937, N-2=3,386, N-3=417) who completed self-report measures of insomnia symptoms, thwarted belongingness, suicidal ideation, and related psychiatric symptoms (e.g., anxiety, hopelessness). Bias-corrected bootstrap mediation analyses were utilized to examine the indirect effects of insomnia symptoms on suicidal ideation through thwarted belongingness, controlling for related psychiatric symptoms.
   Results: Consistent with study hypotheses, thwarted belongingness significantly accounted for the relationship between insomnia and suicidal ideation across all three samples; however, insomnia symptoms did not significantly account for the relationship between thwarted belongingness and suicidal ideation, highlighting the specificity of our findings.
   Limitations: This study utilized cross-sectional self-report data.
   Conclusions: Insomnia may confer suicide risk for military service members and veterans, in part, through the pathway of thwarted belongingness. Additional prospective studies are warranted to further delineate this model of risk. Our results offer a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of suicide, via the promotion of belongingness, among service members and veterans experiencing insomnia symptoms.

AB American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth have higher rates of suicidality than any other ethnic or cultural group in the United States. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is an evidence-based treatment that has been found to reduce suicidality in adolescents, but there is little literature speaking to its efficacy with the AI/AN population. The transactional-ecological model of suicidality helps identify protective factors that can be bolstered at the individual, familial, community, and spiritual levels to reduce suicidality and suicidal contagion in AI/AN youth. The current study examines a case where DBT was culturally adapted and embedded within a transactional-ecological framework to treat a 14-year-old Navajo female with Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features who presented to a psychiatric inpatient facility following a suicide attempt. The patient's wish to die was motivated by her belief that her death could lead to positive changes in an extended family system plagued by historical trauma, alcoholism, suicide, and domestic violence. Ongoing assessment was conducted using the Suicide Status Form (SSF), Suicide Probability Scale (SPS), Reasons for Living Scale for Adolescents (RFL-A), and the DBT diary card. Navajo healing traditions were used in conjunction with DBT skills training and enhancement of ecological protective factors. Initial reduction in depression and suicidality was complicated by an increase in homicidal ideation. A comprehensive psychiatric evaluation was completed, and treatment was modified through medication changes, increased mindfulness practice, bolstering support systems, and engagement in a Navajo healing ceremony. Implications for clinicians treating suicidality in Navajo youth are discussed.

AB Several studies have suggested that suicidal behavior is at least partially determined by genetic factors, supporting a search for related genes. Two genes that have been highlighted in the literature as being involved are HTR1B, which codes for the serotonin 1B receptor, and COMT, which is related to the inactivation of catecholamines. In order to assess the combined evidence for the numerous studies that have been published relating suicidal behavior to these two genes, two different random effects meta-analyses were conducted utilizing seven studies related to HTR1B and six studies related to COMT. For HTR1B, the combined evidence from 789 case and 1,247 control subjects/participants, suggested that there was no significant association between the HTR1B G861C polymorphism. and suicidal behavior. For COMT, based on the combined data from 519 cases and 933 control subjects, there was evidence of a significant association between the COMT 158Met polymorphism. and suicidal behavior. Although the results for COMT were not influenced by publication bias, the significance of the combined results was not robust and was related to the gender of the case and control subjects. The results for COMT support past literature that has found a relationship between suicidal behavior and COMT, and has also found that the relationship differs for males and females. Given that in the United States a higher proportion of females attempt suicide, and the higher proportion of males successfully commit suicide, it is possible that COMT is related to the lethality of suicide attempts.

TI Al-Qaeda as an adversary - Do we understand our enemy?
SO WORLD POLITICS
LA English
DT Review
AB Several recent books on al-Qaeda depict the organization as capable, committed, and bloodthirsty. The authors contend that further attacks, perhaps exceeding the scale of September 11, are likely and may even be inevitable. Indeed, they portray the United States as caught in an enduring struggle with Islamic extremism. Although the effort to arrest, kill, or disrupt al-Qaeda's leadership may be going extremely well, radical Islam appears to be thriving.
   The bleak outlook, however, ignores several. positive signs. Infighting among Islamists remains rampant, a perennial problem that al-Qaeda has managed to reduce but not eliminate. Islamist regimes such as the Taliban's Afghanistan have been overthrown, while revolutionary regimes in Sudan and Iran are now far less fervent. Nor have violent movements gained mass support in the Muslim world, as their bloody tactics alienate more Muslims than they attract.
   This portrait of al-Qaeda as an adversary suggests several policies. First, many of the bromides regarding counterterrorism in general-often drawn from struggles against small, left-wing European groups with at best limited popular appeal-do not apply to al-Qaeda. Its size, dedication, and popular appeal make it unusually, perhaps uniquely, formidable. Second, one must be wary of confusing al-Qaeda with its many affiliates and of confusing these violent radical groups with the broader political Islamist movement. Third, the United States must re-engage its allies, ensuring that its counterterrorism strategy is robust enough to maintain their support. Fourth, public diplomacy, always an American weakness, must go from an episodic and underfunded foreign policy instrument to a major tool of national power. Fifth, al-Qaeda's unusually innovative nature requires the United States to try to defend not only against obvious methods such as truck bombs but also against new means like surface-to-air missiles and sustained suicide bombing campaigns. Sixth and finally, political leaders must engage the public to increase the ability of the United States to stand fast in the event of another major attack.

AB The rate of HIV infection among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) is increasing in the United States, and targeted research is needed to inform interventions aimed at reducing HIV transmission in this population. This study aims to understand the association between HIV status disclosure and sexual risk behavior among HIV-positive YMSM. A particular focus is given to depressive symptoms and their potential role in explaining the association between HIV disclosure and sexual risk behavior. In a sample of 991 YMSM receiving care at 20 clinics across the United States, Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to explore these associations. Approximately one-half (52.4 %) of participants reported disclosing to their current sexual/romantic partner. Disclosure to family members was negatively associated with sexual risk behavior. Also, depressive symptoms were positively associated with sexual risk behavior. We discuss the implications of our findings for future research and intervention.

AB Prisons in the Southern United States are among the most underfunded, understaffed, and crowded in the nation. This study seeks to identify how Alabama state correctional officers experienced crowding related to their mental and physical health and safety. A total of 66 correctional officers at 3 Alabama men's prisons are surveyed about crowding in relation to job performance, health and safety, and inmate control. Respondents at all facilities, which had occupancy rates between 154% and 206% of capacity, report high levels of stress and impaired job performance due to understaffing and overwork. Officers at the most crowded prison are most stressed and fearful of inmates. In the absence of policies to reduce density or increase staffing in prisons, new strategies are urgently needed to reduce occupational stress among officers in crowded correctional facilities.

There is need for improved integration of the knowledge accumulated in the study of death, dying, and bereavement into the basic curricula of the parent disciplines and professional schools. Facilitation of personal engagement with the issue of mortality is an important component of the educative process. Various assessment problems are outlined and some suggestions,for improvements are offered. The death education needs of various groups, including school age children and older adults, are. noted.

AB Context: Prescriptions for nonopioid pharmacological therapies such as gabapentin and baclofen have been increasing. While gabapentin and baclofen are less likely than opioids to result in fatal overdose, they are each associated with dependence, misuse and adverse effects. Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate and describe trends in adult exposures to gabapentin and baclofen reported to U.S. Poison Centers. Methods: This was a retrospective review of data collected by U.S. Poison Centers and entered in the National Poison Data System. We identified all cases of exposures to gabapentin (2013-2017) and baclofen (2014-2017) in patients aged 18 years and over. We then analyzed demographics, common co-ingestions, medical outcomes, and geographic distribution. Results: During the five-year period (2013-2017), there were 74,175 gabapentin exposures. All gabapentin exposures increased by 72.3%; isolated exposures increased by 67.1%; and isolated abuse/misuse exposures increased by 119.9%. During the four-year period (2014-2017), there were 15,397 baclofen exposures. All baclofen exposures increased by 36.2%; isolated exposures increased by 35.0%; and isolated abuse/misuse exposures increased by 31.7%. Co-ingestions of sedatives and opioids were common for both medications. Admissions to a health care facility were required in 16.7% of isolated gabapentin exposures, and 52.1% of isolated baclofen exposures. Intentional suspected suicide attempts with isolated gabapentin exposures increased by 80.5% over a five-year period; and increased by 43% for isolated baclofen exposures over a four-year period. All states saw increases in gabapentin exposures and most states saw increases in baclofen exposures, gabapentin misuse/abuse, and baclofen misuse/abuse. Conclusion: Gabapentin and baclofen misuse, toxicity, use in suicide attempts, and associated healthcare utilization among adults in the United States have significantly increased since 2013. Careful consideration and risk-benefit analysis should be employed when prescribing these medications.

ID OVERDOSE DEATHS; ASSOCIATION; EXPECTANCY; INCREASES; DISEASE; HEALTH
AB Objectives. To assess years of life lost to each cause of death in the United States between 1995 and 2015, and compare it with the number of deaths.
   Methods. We used Vital Statistics mortality data and defined "life-years lost" as remaining life expectancy for each decedent's age, sex, and race. We calculated the share of life-years lost to each cause of death in each year, and examined reasons for changes.
   Results. In 2015, heart disease caused the most deaths, but cancer caused 23% more life-years lost. Life-years lost to heart disease declined 6% since 1995, whereas life-years lost to cancer increased 16%. The increase for cancer was entirely attributable to population growth and longer life expectancy; had these factors remained constant, life-years lost to heart disease and cancer would have fallen 56% and 38%, respectively. Accidents (including overdoses), suicides, and homicides each caused twice the share of life-years lost as deaths. Measuring life-years lost highlighted racial disparities in heart disease, homicides, and perinatal conditions.
   Conclusions. Life-years lost may provide additional context for understanding long-term mortality trends.

Born in France, but raised from early childhood in the United States, Seguin published widely, developed a high-profile New York City practice, and was named Clinical Professor of Diseases of the Mind and Nervous System at the College of Physicians and Surgeons (New York) in 1874. Typical of the era, he studied neurologic disorders, but also several conditions that today would be considered in the realm of psychiatry. One of his seminal papers was titled "The treatment of mild cases of melancholia at home" (1876). Contrary to the widespread practice of isolating patients in either rest homes or asylums, Seguin introduced and formalized treatment of depression within the household. Against this academic backdrop, Seguin returned home on October 31, 1882, to discover that his own wife, afflicted with long-standing depression and treated at home, had committed suicide after murdering their 3 children. The grim dichotomy between the confidently written paper and the reality of the treatment failure is a neurologic lesson in humility regarding diseases and their unpredictable outcomes.

AB Objectives. To evaluate trends in premature death rates by cause of death, age, race, and urbanization level in the United States.
   Methods. We calculated cause-specific death rates using the Compressed Mortality File, National Center for Health Statistics data for adults aged 25 to 64 years in 2 time periods: 1999 to 2001 and 2013 to 2015. We defined 48 subpopulations by 10-year age groups, race/ethnicity, and county urbanization level (large urban, suburban, small or medium metropolitan, and rural).
   Results. The age-adjusted premature death rates for all adults declined by8% between 1999 to 2001 and 2013 to 2015, with decreases in 39 of the 48 subpopulations. Most decreases in death rates were attributable to HIV, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. All 9 subpopulations with increased death rates were non-Hispanic Whites, largely outside large urban areas. Most increases in death rates were attributable to suicide, poisoning, and liver disease.
   Conclusions. The unfavorable recent trends in premature death rate among non-Hispanic Whites outside large urban areas were primarily caused by self-destructive health behaviors likely related to underlying social and economic factors in these communities.

AB In the United States, different people have different rights to die. This Article traces the origins of death-sentenced prisoners' ability to enlist assistance in dying and compares it to the considerably more circumscribed right held by people with serious illness. It uses empirical research on "volunteers," death-sentenced prisoners who sought execution, to argue that the legal standard for adjudicating their requests to hasten execution should be changed. Empirical evidence suggests many of the concerns governing the regulation of assisted dying in the medical context are present in the death row case. This Article therefore urges courts to use a balancing test comparable to that developed in cases involving assisted dying in the medical context. Further, counsel should be appointed to articulate the state's interests in subjecting the conviction and sentence to appellate review.

AB The effects of solitary confinement have been debated since at least the middle of the nineteenth century when both Americans and Europeans began to question the then-widespread use of solitary confinement of convicted offenders. A sizable and impressively sophisticated literature, now largely forgotten, accumulated for more than a half century and documented significant damage to prisoners. More recently the development of supermax prisons in the United States and human rights objections to pretrial solitaty confinement in Scandinavia revived interest in the topic and controversy over the findings. The weight of the modern evidence concurs with the findings of earlier research: whether and how isolation damages people depends on duration and circumstances and is mediated by prisoners' individual characteristics; but for many prisoners, the adverse effects are substantial.

AB Penetrating self-inflicted injury is a mechanism that occurs with significant frequency at many trauma centers in the United States and internationally. With high rates of unemployment and growing numbers of individuals with mental illness, we expect more and more patients to present with these injuries. Additionally, there are known to be misconceptions about the seriousness of injuries that can occur when penetrating trauma is self-inflicted, especially with stab wounds. There is also often uncertainty among surgeons regarding how to treat these patients effectively in a multidisciplinary fashion while working with psychiatry services. Our goal was to review the epidemiology, mechanisms, anatomic considerations, role of substance use, and psychiatric illness in these injuries and the approach to evaluation and treatment of these patients.

TI Exploring coronial determination of intent for poisoning-related deaths

DT Article
DE Coroners systems; Suicide; Drug and alcohol policy; Medico-legal
   databases; Coding and classification
ID UNDETERMINED MANNER; SUICIDE; CLASSIFICATION; PREVENTION; TIME
AB Background: In countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, systematic variation in the classification of intent in pharmaceutical poisoning deaths have been identified between jurisdictions. This study aimed to explore whether the coronial determination of intent (unintentional, intentional, undetermined) for pharmaceutical-related poisoning deaths may have affected death rates over time and by jurisdiction in Australia.
   Methods: A retrospective examination of mortality records in the National Coronial Information System (NCIS) during 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2013 was conducted. The NCIS is a national internet-based data storage and retrieval system for deaths that were notified to a coroner. Pharmaceutical deaths due to unintentional, intentional or undetermined intent were identified using the NCIS classification. Proportions of the different intent classifications and the mortality rates by intent over time were compared between jurisdictions.
   Results: There were 17,895 pharmaceutical-related poisoning deaths in Australia between 2001 and 2013 that had closed cases in the NCIS. Proportions of deaths classified as unintentional (48.3-66.3%), intentional (24.7-35.9%) and undetermined (6.7-24.7%) varied significantly among Australian jurisdictions. There were significant increases in the rate of classification of unintentional poisoning for some states, and significant increases in intentional poisoning classification in Western Australia, and decreases in New South Wales and Victoria. There was no significant change in classification of undetermined intent.
   Conclusions: Significant variation in classifications of intent, both between state jurisdictions and over time, may be the result of regional differences in demographics and increases in prescription drug misuse. However, the inconsistent use of 'undetermined' intent between state jurisdictions suggests coroners may experience varying difficulty in retrospectively ruling on intent in the equivocal circumstances of pharmaceutical poisoning. The widespread use of psychological autopsy may assist coroners to classify intent, while the implementation of new classifications for pharmaceutical poisoning death may overcome some of the inherent difficulty in intent classification and improve the potential for injury surveillance irrespective of intent.

AB Postpartum depression has been described as a thief that steals motherhood. It can result in tragedy and sometimes in headline-gripping maternal suicide or infanticide. Because one of the highest priorities for nursing is to continually advance the knowledge the underlies nursing practice, it is essential that we understand what nurse researchers have done to advance the knowledge base of postpartum depression. This integrative review is a two-part series for MCN that summarizes 141 postpartum depression studies conducted by nurse researchers from around the globe, including United States, Australia, Canada, China (Hong Kong, Taiwan), Finland, Iceland Sweden, Turkey, and Malaysia. Specific areas of postpartum depression to which nurse researchers have devoted their primary attention include epidemiology, risk factors, transcultural perspectives, instrument development, screening, interventions and mother-infant interactions.

AB Objectives. To examine whether indicators of community-and state-level lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender equality are associated with transgender veterans' mental health.
   Methods. We extracted Veterans Administration data for patients who were diagnosed with gender identity disorder, had at least 1 visit in 2013, and lived in a zip code with a Municipality Equality Index score (n = 1640). We examined the associations of whether a state included transgender status in employment nondiscrimination laws and in hate crimes laws with mood disorders; alcohol, illicit drug, and tobacco use disorders; posttraumatic stress disorder; and suicidal ideation or attempt.
   Results. Nearly half (47.3%) of the sample lived in states with employment discrimination protection, and 44.8% lived in states with hate crimes protection. Employment nondiscrimination protection was associated with 26% decreased odds of mood disorders (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.59, 0.93) and 43% decreased odds of self-directed violence (AOR = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.34, 0.95).
   Conclusions. Understanding lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender social stressors can inform treatment and care coordination for transgender populations.

AB Evidence suggests that antidepressant treatment may in some cases result in worsening depression and increased risk of suicidality in pediatric and adolescent patients. The United States Food and Drug Administration requires that antidepressants carry a black box warning regarding such a risk in patients up to age 24. Many studies of antidepressant-induced suicidality among adults have also reported an increased risk, while several other investigations involving that population have not supported such a finding. This article provides an update of the controversy surrounding antidepressants as a potential cause of suicidal ideations or behavior. Antidepressant-induced suicidality appears to be an uncommon occurrence but also a legitimate phenomenon. Close monitoring and a follow-up care should be provided for patients after initiation of a new antidepressant.

AB Context: National data on the epidemiology of firearm injuries and circumstances of firearm deaths are difficult to obtain and often are nonreliable. Since firearm injury and death rates and causes can vary substantially between states, it is critical to consider state-specific data sources.
   Objective: In this study, we illustrate how states can systematically examine demographic characteristics, firearm information, type of wound, toxicology tests, precipitating circumstances, and costs to provide a comprehensive picture of firearm injuries and deaths using data sets from a single state with relatively low rates of firearm injury and death.
   Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Setting: Firearm-related injury data for the period 2005-2014 were obtained from the Rhode Island emergency department and hospital discharge data sets; death data for the same period were obtained from the Rhode Island Violent Death Reporting System.
   Main Outcome Measure: Descriptive statistics were used. Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project cost-to-charge ratios were used to convert total hospital charges to costs.
   Results: Most firearm-related emergency department visits (55.8%) and hospital discharges (79.2%) in Rhode Island were from assaults; however, most firearm-related deaths were suicides (60.1%). The annual cost of firearm-related hospitalizations was more than $830 000. Most decedents who died because of firearms tested positive for illicit substances. Nearly a quarter (23.5%) of firearm-related homicides were due to a conflict between the decedent and suspect. More than half (59%) of firearm suicide decedents were reported to have had current mental or physical problems prior to death.
   Conclusions: Understanding the state-specific magnitude and patterns (who, where, factors, etc) of firearm injury and death may help inform local injury prevention efforts. States with similar data sets may want to adopt our analyses. Surveillance of firearm-related injury and death is essential. Dissemination of surveillance findings to key stakeholders is critical in improving firearm injury prevention. States that are not part of the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) could work with their other data sources to obtain a better picture of violent injuries and deaths to make the best use of resources.

AB The aim of the current paper is to examine the impact of the enactment of constitutional prohibition in the United States in 1920 on total homicides, alcohol-related homicides and non-alcohol-related homicides in Chicago.
   Data are drawn from the Chicago Historical Homicide Project, a data set chronicling 11 018 homicides in Chicago between 1870 and 1930. Interrupted time-series and autoregression integrated moving average (ARIMA) models are employed to examine the impact of prohibition on three separate population-adjusted homicide series. All models control for potential confounding from World War I demobilization and from trend data drawn from Wesley Skogan's Time-Series Data from Chicago.
   Total and non-alcohol-related homicide rates increased during prohibition by 21% and 11%, respectively, while alcohol-related homicides remained unchanged. For other covariates, alcohol-related homicides were related negatively to the size of the Chicago police force and positively to police expenditures and to the proportion of the Chicago population aged 21 years and younger. Non-alcohol-related homicides were related positively to police expenditures and negatively to the size of the Chicago police force.
   While total and non-alcohol-related homicides in the United States continued to rise during prohibition, a finding consistent with other studies, the rate of alcohol-related homicides remained unchanged. The divergent impact of prohibition on alcohol- and non-alcohol-related homicides is discussed in relation to previous studies of homicide in this era.

AB Objectives. We examined the relationship between gun ownership and stranger versus nonstranger homicide rates.
   Methods. Using data from the Supplemental Homicide Reports of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports for all 50 states for 1981 to 2010, we modeled stranger and nonstranger homicide rates as a function of state-level gun ownership, measured by a proxy, controlling for potential confounders. We used a negative binomial regression model with fixed effects for year, accounting for clustering of observations among states by using generalized estimating equations.
   Results. We found no robust, statistically significant correlation between gun ownership and stranger firearm homicide rates. However, we found a positive and significant association between gun ownership and nonstranger firearm homicide rates. The incidence rate ratio for nonstranger firearm homicide rate associated with gun ownership was 1.014 (95% confidence interval = 1.009, 1.019).
   Conclusions. Our findings challenge the argument that gun ownership deters violent crime, in particular, homicides.

ID MORTALITY; CENTERS
AB Objective: To determine the impact of the increasing aging population on trauma mortality relative to mortality from cancer and heart disease in the United States.
   Background: The population in the United States continues to increase as medical advancements allow people to live longer. The resulting changes in the leading causes of death have not yet been recognized.
   Methods: Datawere obtained (2000-2010) from the Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System database of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We defined trauma deaths as unintentional injuries, suicides, and homicides.
   Results: From 2000 to 2010, the US population increased by 9.7% and the number of trauma deaths increased by 22.8%. Trauma deaths and death rates deceased in individuals younger than 25 years but increased for those 25 years and older. During this period, death rates for cancer and heart disease decreased. The largest increases in trauma deaths were in individuals in their fifth and sixth decades of life. Since 2000, the largest proportional increase (118%) in crude trauma deaths occurred in 54-year-olds. Overall, in 2010, trauma was the leading cause of death in individuals 46 years and younger. Trauma remains the leading cause of years of life lost.
   Results: Trauma is now the leading cause of death for individuals 46 years and younger. The largest increase in the number of trauma deaths and the highest crude number of trauma deaths occurred in baby boomers. Policy makers allocating resources should be made aware of the larger impact of trauma on our aging and burgeoning US population.

AB Severe acetaminophen hepatotoxicity frequently leads to acute liver failure (ALF). We determined the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of acetaminophen-induced ALF at 22 tertiary care centers in the United States. Detailed prospective data were gathered on 662 consecutive patients over a 6-year period fulfilling standard criteria for ALF (coagulopathy and encephalopathy), from which 275 (42%) were determined to result from acetaminophen liver injury. The annual percentage of acetaminophen-related ALF rose during the study from 28% in 1998 to 51% in 2003. Median dose ingested was 24 g (equivalent to 48 extra-strength tablets). Unintentional overdoses accounted for 131 (48%) cases, intentional (suicide attempts) 122 (44%), and 22(8%) were of unknown intent. In the unintentional group, 38% took two or more acetaminophen preparations simultaneously, and 63% used narcotic-containing compounds. Eighty-one percent of unintentional patients reported taking acetaminophen and/or other analgesics for acute or chronic pain syndromes. Overall, 178 subjects (65%) survived, 74 (27%) died without transplantation, and 23 subjects (8%) underwent liver transplantation; 71% were alive at 3 weeks. Transplant-free survival rate and rate of liver transplantation were similar between intentional and unintentional groups. In conclusion, acetaminophen hepatotoxicity far exceeds other causes of acute liver failure in the United States. Susceptible patients have concomitant depression, chronic pain, alcohol or narcotic use, and/or take several preparations simultaneously. Education of patients, physicians, and pharmacies to limit high-risk use settings is recommended.

SO LANCET

DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; OWNERSHIP; ASSOCIATION; SUICIDE; DEATH; RISK; LAWS
AB Background In an effort to reduce firearm mortality rates in the USA, US states have enacted a range of firearm laws to either strengthen or deregulate the existing main federal gun control law, the Brady Law. We set out to determine the independent association of different firearm laws with overall firearm mortality, homicide firearm mortality, and suicide firearm mortality across all US states. We also projected the potential reduction of firearm mortality if the three most strongly associated firearm laws were enacted at the federal level.
   Methods We constructed a cross-sectional, state-level dataset from Nov 1, 2014, to May 15, 2015, using counts of firearm-related deaths in each US state for the years 2008-10 (stratified by intent [homicide and suicide]) from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System, data about 25 firearm state laws implemented in 2009, and state-specific characteristics such as firearm ownership for 2013, firearm export rates, and non-firearm homicide rates for 2009, and unemployment rates for 2010. Our primary outcome measure was overall firearm-related mortality per 100 000 people in the USA in 2010. We used Poisson regression with robust variances to derive incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% CIs.
   Findings 31 672 firearm-related deaths occurred in 2010 in the USA (10.1 per 100 000 people; mean state-specific count 631.5 [SD 629.1]). Of 25 firearm laws, nine were associated with reduced firearm mortality, nine were associated with increased firearm mortality, and seven had an inconclusive association. After adjustment for relevant covariates, the three state laws most strongly associated with reduced overall firearm mortality were universal background checks for firearm purchase (multivariable IRR 0.39 [95% CI 0.23-0.67]; p=0.001), ammunition background checks (0.18 [0.09-0.36]; p<0.0001), and identification requirement for firearms (0.16 [0.09-0.29]; p<0.0001). Projected federal-level implementation of universal background checks for firearm purchase could reduce national firearm mortality from 10.35 to 4.46 deaths per 100 000 people, background checks for ammunition purchase could reduce it to 1.99 per 100 000, and firearm identification to 1.81 per 100 000.
   Interpretation Very few of the existing state-specific firearm laws are associated with reduced firearm mortality, and this evidence underscores the importance of focusing on relevant and effective firearms legislation. Implementation of universal background checks for the purchase of firearms or ammunition, and firearm identification nationally could substantially reduce firearm mortality in the USA.

AB To date, little empirical data exists examining the psychological experience of survivors of child sex trafficking in the form of prostitution, nor does current scientific data suggest how American women and children are recruited into the sex trade and sold for sex within the United States. This qualitative research study analyzed the narratives of interviews with 6 survivors of child and adolescent sex trafficking to assess factors that influenced their ability to survive, leave the sex trade, and reintegrate back into the community. Data were analyzed with an ecological systems model and a number of patterns emerged within participants' microsystems, mesosystems, and macrosystems. In the survivor microsystem, participants' insecure attachments led to their vulnerability to recruitment; within the mesosystem unsafe relationships contributed to increased emotional insecurities; in the macrosystem, participants were raised in environments that desensitized them to prostitution. In regard to escape and resilience, in the survivor microsystem participants left the sex trade because of pregnancy or mental health symptoms; in this mesosystem, participants needed safe relationships and increased self-worth; at the level of the macrosystem, once participants left the industry they began processing their traumatic experiences through the mental health system. These data provide unprecedented insights into the psychological effects that the sex trade has on the individuals involved, shedding light on an unexplored issue that has a profound, yet furtive presence in the United States.

   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study included statewide, all-payer, longitudinally linked ED patient records and mortality data from all California residents who presented to a California-licensed ED at least 1 time from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2011, with deliberate self-harm, suicidal ideation but not self-harm, or neither (a 5% random sample). Age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-adjusted standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for suicide and other manners or causes of death were determined for each patient group using statewide mortality data. Data were analyzed from January 10 to July 18, 2019.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Suicide and other manners or causes of death were ascertained using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes. Suicide rate and all mortality rates were measured per 100 000 person-years.
   RESULTS Among 648 646 individuals (mean [SD] age, 43.8 [20.6] years; 350 687 [54.1%] women) who visited an ED in California from 2009 to 2011, the rates of suicide deaths per 100 000 person-years in the year after index ED presentation were 693.4 deaths among 83 507 individuals presenting with deliberate self-harm (SMR, 56.8; 95% CI, 52.1-61.4), 384.5 deaths among 67 379 individuals presenting with suicidal ideation but not self-harm (SMR, 31.4; 95% CI, 27.5-35.2), and 23.4 deaths among 497 760 reference patients (SMR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.6-2.3). Compared with the demographically matched general population, the rates of nonsuicide external-cause mortality were also increased among patients with self-harm (SMR, 14.2; 95% CI, 12.9-15.5), patients with suicidal ideation (SMR, 11.8; 95% CI, 10.6-13.0), and reference patients (SMR, 2.2; 95% CI, 2.0-2.3). In all 3 groups, the rates of suicide mortality per 100 000 person-years were higher among men (deliberate self-harm: 1011.1 deaths; suicidal ideation: 539.8 deaths; reference: 36.6 deaths), people 65 years or older (deliberate self-harm: 1919.5 deaths; suicidal ideation: 691.2 deaths; reference: 28.6 deaths), and non-Hispanic white patients (deliberate self-harm: 914.1 deaths; suicidal ideation: 511.6 deaths; reference: 33.8 deaths) than among their respective referent groups. Other sociodemographic factors and clinical diagnoses were associated with striking differences in suicide rates, but these patterns were heterogeneous across patient groups.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest that ED patients with deliberate self-harm or suicidal ideation are associated with substantially increased risk of suicide and other mortality during the year after ED presentation. The process of planning for ED discharge may present opportunities to help ensure safe transitions to continuing outpatient mental health care and to consider broader risk for unintentional injury and other causes of premature mortality.

This section covers situations in trauma unique to the geriatric population, who are often under-triaged and have significant injuries underestimated. Topics covered include age-related pathophysiological changes, underlying existing medical conditions and certain daily medications that increase the risk of serious injury in elderly trauma patients. Diagnostic evaluation of this group requires liberal testing, imaging, and a multidisciplinary team approach. Topics germane to geriatric trauma including hypothermia, elder abuse, and depression and suicide are also covered.

AB The experience of receiving patient requests for assistance in prematurely ending life can represent both an ethical and legal dilemma for nurses in the United States. Similarly, the study of nurses' involvement with such a sensitive topic also poses risks to the study participants, the researcher, and the nursing profession's covenant with society. The purpose of this article is to explore methodological issues and approaches associated with studying an ethically and legally sensitive issue, and to describe application of these approaches to a study of oncology nurses' experiences with receiving requests for assisted dying from terminally ill patients with cancer.

AB A needs assessment surveying American Indians and Alaska Natives (AIs/ANs) at an AI/AN health center in the Midwestern United States was conducted, with an emphasis on traditional Native healing. Data from this study included qualitative material from interviews of community members (N = 27; age 12-82) and service providers (N = 11; age 26-70). Respondents emphasized the path to wellness includes physical, spiritual and mental health and that traditional healing can restore various imbalances. Furthermore, traditional healing was considered a complement to Western medicine. Third, traditional medicine as a tool in healthcare settings was conceptualized on a continuum.

AB A reexamination of ethnicity as a risk factor for adolescent suicidal behavior, focusing on whether Mexican American youths are at increased risk, was undertaken. Data from a sample of 4,175 African, European, and Mexican Americans, aged 11-17, are presented. We examined lifetime attempts and past year attempts, thoughts, and plans. Odds ratios, adjusting for covariates, indicate no differences between European and Mexican Americans on past year thoughts, plans, or attempts or lifetime attempts. Although some studies have reported Mexican American youths are at increased risk, we did not find any differences. Possible explanations for disparate results across studies are discussed, in particular methods effects.

AB Adolescent development includes solidification of personal identity, ethical beliefs, approach to the world, patterns of friendships, cognitive sophistication and sexual/gender identity. Rapid brain development accounts for many of the changes of adolescence, but this can be affected by environmental and social factors. In the US, the top 3 causes of adolescent death are unintentional injuries (often involving motor vehicles), homicide and suicide. In Canada, the top 3 are unintentional injuries (more than a third of deaths in 15-19 year olds), suicide (about a fifth of deaths) and neoplasia. This chapter does not discuss some major areas of health and determinants, including gay, lesbian and trans-gender youth, gender inequality and mental health. Issues for aboriginal youth include those of education, nutrition, housing and racism. Racism is not limited to this group and is also intertwined with the issues faced by immigrant youth. Access to high-quality education is particularly problematic in the United States. Alcohol and other substance use lead to health issues and also educational problems. Adolescent pregnancy, parenting and access to abortion are issues in both countries (more extreme in the US). Finally, the care of children by the state leads to issues in adolescence and adulthood.

The Inflammatory Diet is now shown to be related to diabetes. Multiple perspectives on palliative care for the homeless. Could pharmacists assist in preventing suicide? There are changes in the practice of family medicine. Social determinants of health substantially influence health and medical care. Moreover, care for patients from deprived communities is under-reimbursed. Patient pre-existing conditions increased after the Affordable Care Act, suggesting that repealing pre-existing condition protections would likely exacerbate disparities in health and health care.

AB Liver transplantation (LT) programs encounter patients with fulminant hepatic failure resulting from suicide attempts involving acetaminophen or multidrug ingestion. Members of transplant teams often have different opinions about whether these patients should be offered transplantation. Disagreements can delay the transfer of these patients to a transplant facility and negatively affect their management. Currently, transplant programs have no guidelines to help them with their decisions about the appropriateness of LT for these patients. Here we present a clinical case encountered at our facility, and we discuss ethical principles that should help programs to make informed decisions about transplantation for these patients.

TI A disability perspective from the United States on the case of Ms B
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
AB This article will examine the case of Ms B, a woman with tetraplegia for a year, who, prior to rehabilitation or return to community life, sought a ruling that doctors may turn off her ventilator. The authors are people with disabilities. Their analysis focuses on the manner in which the High Court (a) framed the case in terms of mental capacity, (b) addressed the issue of suicide and ambivalence, and (c) resolved informed consent and treatment alternative issues. While the disability community in the US does not oppose the general right to refuse treatment, there is significant concern about lack of informed consent and denial of desired treatment alternatives, and the cavalier manner in which these factors have been dismissed.

AB A significant portion of the world's population is impacted by chronic pain; in the United States, chronic pain costs billions annually in treatment and lost productivity. A needs assessment was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of chronic nonmalignant pain (CNMP) at a university occupational therapy clinic over a 3-month period; recommendations were made to improve pain management at the clinic and referring hospital system. Graded Chronic Pain Scale 2.0 results indicated the prevalence of CNMP was a significant problem. Three evidence-based interventions based on the biblically based CREATION Health Model were developed.

AB High unemployment rates entail substantial costs to the working population in terms of reduced subjective well-being. This paper studies the importance of individual economic security, in particular job security, by exploiting sector-specific institutional differences in the exposure to economic shocks. Public servants have stricter dismissal protection and face a lower risk of their organization becoming bankrupt than private sector employees. The empirical results from individual panel data for Germany and repeated cross-sectional data for the United States and Europe show that private sector employees subjective well-being reacts indeed much more sensitive to fluctuations in unemployment rates than public sector employees'.

AB Using Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study (CILS), this study examined the links between strain, psychological conflicts, aspiration-attainment gap, and depressive tendencies of 755 youth of Mexican origin. Two research questions were raised: (a) What types of strain and psychological conflict induced depressive tendencies? (b) What types of aspirations were relevant to these depressive symptoms? Overall, this study showed that factors implicated by collision of values, perceived discrepancies between aspiration and attainment, and negative appraisal of self could induce depressive mood, feelings, and behaviors, an important finding revealing that this underserved population can benefit from better public health services.

AB Transgender individuals experience violence and discrimination, which, in addition to gender transitioning, are established correlates of psychological distress. In a statewide sample of 350 transgender adults, we investigated whether a history of violence and discrimination increased the odds of reporting lifetime suicidal ideation (SI) and whether differences in SI were predicted by gender transition status. Violence, discrimination, and transition status significantly predicted SI. Compared with individuals with no plans to transition, individuals with plans or who were living as their identified gender reported greater odds of lifetime SI. We discuss implications for SI disparities using Meyer's minority stress model.

AB BACKGROUND Little research exists examining the impact of multiple minority identities, particularly sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and sex on health-risk behaviors like mental health, substance use, violence, and sexual risk among high school students in the United States. In this study, we use a nationally representative dataset to examine differences between non-Hispanic white heterosexuals (HSs) and non-Hispanic white sexual minority, black HS, black sexual minority, Hispanic HS, and Hispanic sexual minority students. METHODS Data from the 2015 wave of the Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance System were used in this study. Chi-square and hierarchical logistic regression models examined differences between the groups on outcomes including: (1) mental health and suicide, (2) alcohol, tobacco, and illicit substances, (3) sexual risk and protective factors, and (4) school and physical and/or sexual violence. RESULTS Whereas sexual minority youth (SMY) generally demonstrate poorer health outcomes compared to HSs, SMY who are also racial/ethnic minorities often have even poorer health outcomes, particularly relating to substance use, sexual risk behaviors, physical/sexual violence, and suicide. CONCLUSIONS The need for culturally tailored education and school-based interventions that consider intersections between race/ethnicity, sexual identity, and biological sex are warranted to address health disparities related to mental health and suicide, substance use, sexual risk, and violence.

There were 12,917 exposures, increasing from 927 in 1993 to 2,445 in 1999. The majority of children during the entire study period experienced no effect (60.3%) or minor effects (28.7%), with no fatalities. Most common reasons were unintentional general or therapeutic errors in children under 13 years and suicide attempt in adolescents. Adolescents were more likely to experience clinical toxicity, hospitalizations and more serious outcomes. The trend of increasing frequency of methylphenidate exposures reported to poison centers exactly parallels increasing therapeutic use.

AB Background: The defeat-entrapment theory has been proposed to explain both depression and suicidal behavior.
   Methods: Measures of defeat, entrapment, hopelessness and depression were administered to Iranian and American students.
   Results: Scores on measures of hopelessness, defeat, entrapment and depression were strongly associated. In both nations, scores for defeat and entrapment were stronger predictors of past suicidal ideation and attempted suicide. Overall, the Iranian respondents had higher scores on the measures of defeat, entrapment, hopelessness and depression, but less often reported prior suicidal ideation.
   Conclusion: The defeat-entrapment theory of depression and suicidal behavior appears to have validity in both Iran and America.

The pervasive nature, causes, and different forms of violence in the United States are compared with those found in other countries. Underlying sociocultural values and myths, historical and current cultural contexts are considered breeding grounds for potential violence. How therapists can promote healthy change in their groups and in the broader society is explored. The articles contained in part one are reviewed against this backdrop.

AB Depression is a common mental disorder affecting individuals. Although many strides have been made in the area of depression, little is known about depression in special populations, especially African American men. African American men often differ in their presentation of depression and are often misdiagnosed. African American men are at greater risk for depression, but they are less likely to participate in mental health care. This article explores depression in African American by looking at environmental factors, sigma, role, and other unique to this populations, such as John Henryism. Interventions to encourage early screening and participation in care are also discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The purpose of this study was to explore ethical issues hospice volunteers confront in their work. Interviews with 39 hospice volunteers were conducted, audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative methods. Prominent themes were dilemmas about gifts, patient care and Family concerns, issues related to volunteer roles and boundaries, and issues surrounding suicide and hastening death. Suggestions for training include discussions of ethics after initial training once volunteers had confronted ethical issues, With special emphasis on strategies for negotiating their uneasy role positioned between health care professional and friend.

AB Depression imposes significant costs on sufferers, their families and caregivers, employers and insurance payers. This article summarises medical and health economics literature regarding the societal economic burden of depression and the incremental economic burden of depression sufferers in comparison with non-depressed counterparts. This substantial knowledge base probably underestimates the true economic burden of the disease because the available data and analysis techniques do not capture all of the subtle costs of this condition. Future investigation is likely to focus on the relationship between depression and comorbid conditions, the role of caregiver burdens, and the economic differences in life outcomes.

AB Recent reviews and national statistics indicate that, so far, our field has made limited progress on fulfilling its central mission of preventing future suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs). We posit that a fundamental reason for our lack of progress is the way in which our field tends to think about and select STB intervention targets. Specifically, the vast majority of our intervention targets are derived from untested theoretical assertions, moderate correlates of STBs, or weak risk factors for STBs. None of these forms of evidence permits causal inferences, which is problematic because successful STB interventions must target the causes of STBs. To develop effective interventions, we must employ experimental designs to identify targets that are causal, necessary, and viable.

ID ETHNIC DISPARITIES; REPORTING SYSTEM
AB Injuries and violence among young people have a substantial emotional, physical, and economic toll on society. Understanding the epidemiology of this public health problem can guide prevention efforts, help identify and reduce risk factors, and promote protective factors. We examined fatal and nonfatal unintentional injuries, injuries intentionally inflicted by other (i.e., assaults and homicides) among children ages 0-19, and intentionally self-inflicted injuries (i.e., self-harm and suicides) among children ages 10-19. We accessed deaths (1999-2015) and visits to emergency departments (2001-2015) for these age groups through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS), and examined trends and differences by age, sex, race/ethnicity, rural/urban status, and injury mechanism. Almost 13,000 children and adolescents age 0-19 years died in 2015 from injury and violence compared to over 17,000 in 1999. While the overall number of deaths has decreased over time, there were increases in death rates among certain age groups for some categories of unintentional injury and for suicides. The leading causes of injury varied by age group. Our results indicate that efforts to reduce injuries to children and adolescents should consider cause, intent, age, sex, race, and regional factors to assure that prevention resources are directed at those at greatest risk.

AB Background: Both physical and emotional traumas have been related to neurologic and neuroendocrine abnormalities that may be associated with violent behavior.
   Methods: A modified case-control design was used for blinded comparison of 113 female inmates convicted of violent and nonviolent crimes. History of having been physically or sexually abused, neurologic history and physical examination, basal salivary cortisol levels, and associated variables were investigated to identify possible risk factors for violent compared to nonviolent criminal convictions.
   Results: Of all inmates studied, 95% had neurologic histories predating the current crime and/or neurologic examination abnormalities. Logistic regression revealed morning cortisol levels, number of years since last abuse, number of prior suicide attempts, and traumatic brain injuries with loss of consciousness to be significantly associated with current violent convictions, with a mean of two brain injuries with loss of consciousness per subject in the violent group.
   Conclusions: A greater number of traumatic brain injuries with loss of consciousness and suicide attempts, more recent abuse, and low morning basal salivary cortisol levels could be associated with dangerous violent criminal behavior, including murder, in female prison inmates. Future research should investigate neuroendocrine challenges, more psychiatric and violence measures, and different populations with longitudinal designs. (C) 2004 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

AB Law enforcement agencies often deal with difficult, dangerous, and disordered individuals by applying the theory and practice of tactical negotiation, which is composed of a unique application of communication techniques aimed at obtaining voluntary compliance. Known as hostage or crisis negotiation, law enforcement tactical negotiation (LETN) has shown to be an effective technique for resolving barricaded hostage and crisis situations, kidnappings, and suicidal incidents. Over the years, there have been several models of LETN, however; most of them are based on the assumption that the 1) subject is rational and 2) the subject views the officer as credible; however, in situations where people are in crisis, emotions control their actions rather than reason. Therefore, being successful requires the officer to return the subject to a rational state of mind and establish trust (credibility). If either of these, elements are missing, then traditional negotiation will most likely fail in gaining voluntary compliance in a timely manner. This is especially true with suicidal persons who have exceeded their ability to cope with their situation and believe that no one will help them. The Behavioral Influence Stairway Model (BISM) operates on the premise that a state of personal crisis occurs when coping and social support mechanisms fail and that to end the crisis, at least one of these elements must be restored. In these situations, the BISM provides a method by which the officer can re-establish social support through effectively dealing with emotions (thus returning the individual to a rational state of mind) and demonstrating empathy (thus obtaining trust).
   In Hong Kong, the Police Negotiation Cadre (PNC) routinely deals with a unique form of suicide where persons in crisis frequently choose jumping off high-rise buildings as their preferred means of suicide. Unlike in the United States, where a significant number of suicides involve barricaded individuals with firearms, most LETN in Hong Kong is accomplished face-to-face, since officer safety relating to firearms is atypical. Despite these differences in structure, culture, and language, the BISM is routinely used to successfully resolve suicidal situations in Hong Kong, based on the theory that emotions and relationship needs are universal and not contingent on context. Therefore, this article will present an updated version of the BISM and extend the principles of the BISM cross-culturally by providing evidence of its efficacy in negotiating with suicidal persons who threaten to jump from multi-story buildings in Hong Kong, as well as its proactive application to non-police intervenors.

AB Background: Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is an analgesic and antipyretic drug widely used across the world. Its ingestion is one of the most common causes of drug overdose. In the United States is the first cause of acute hepatitis in adults. Aim: To describe the epidemiological profile of paracetamol overdose in Chile. Material and Methods: Cross sectional retrospective study that included all the phone call inquiries received at the Poison Control Center of the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile (CITUC) during 2009. Results: Nine hundred fifty nine inquiries involving acute paracetamol exposures were received. Women represented a 63.1% of the cases. Half of the cases were suicide attempts, of which 74.8% were women. Accidental exposures occurred mainly in children. In 29.3% of the patients, the exposure was considered to involve a hepatotoxic dose. Women had 2.7 times the risk of men to ingest a toxic dose of paracetamol with suicidal purpose (Odds ratio (OR) = 2.7; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.1-3.6; p < 0.001). Adolescents had 3.4 times the risk of the general consultants (OR: 3.4; 95% CI: 2.4-4.7; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Paracetamol overdose is common in Chile. Authorities should carry out preventive measures. Antidotes and the capacity to measure plasma levels of paracetamol should be available in healthcare centers. (Rev Med Chile 2012; 140: 313-318).

AB Background/Aims: Gene therapy is a promising approach for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, transduction of non-tumoral hepatocytes may lead to severe hepatitis when using suicide gene therapy approaches. The aim of our study was to evaluate the gene transfer efficiency into HCC cells and normal hepatocytes using human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-derived lentiviral vectors in vitro and in vivo.
   Methods: Lentiviral vectors encoding for the LacZ gene or the fusion gene HSV-Tk/GFP were tested in vitro in human HCC cells and human hepatocytes in primary culture and in vivo in a chemically induced rat model of HCC.
   Results: We show that HIV-1-derived lentiviral vectors are efficient in transducing HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. No significant transduction of non-tumorous hepatocytes was observed in vivo whatever the route of administration used. Measurement of tumor growth following direct intratumoral injection of a lentiviral vector containing the HSV-Tk gene and GCV treatment showed a strong antitumoral efficacy in the absence of normal liver toxicity.
   Conclusions: These observations suggest that lentiviral vectors allow an antitumoral effect with low liver toxicity when using suicide gene therapy approach and could be efficient tools for HCC gene therapy.

TI Advance Directives for Refusing Life-Sustaining Treatment in Dementia
SO HASTINGS CENTER REPORT
LA English
DT Article
ID DEATH
AB Aid-in-dying laws in the United States have two important restrictions. First, only patients who are terminally ill, defined as having a prognosis of six months or less to live, qualify. Second, at the time the patients take the lethal medication, they must be competent to make medical decisions. This means that an advance directive requesting aid in dying for a later time when the patient lacks decision-making capacity would be invalid. However, many people are more concerned about avoiding living into severe dementia for yearsa time when they will lack decision-making capacitythan they are about preventing suffering or the loss of dignity or autonomy for a few months at the end of life.Gillian Bennett is an example of someone determined not to live into severe dementia. She opted for preemptive suicide in 2014, explaining why in a letter she posted online: Every day I lose bits of myself, and it's obvious that I am heading toward the state that all dementia patients eventually get to: not knowing who I am and requiring full-time care.A major problem with Bennett's solution, however, is that the individual is likely thereby to be giving up some good time. A legal alternative to preemptive suicide is to create an advance directive stating the circumstances under which one wants not to receive any lifesaving or life-sustaining treatment, even the most basic and noninvasive. This option is our focus in this paper: how to create effective advance directives to avoid living into severe dementia. To be relevant to progressive dementia, the directive would need to state what kinds of care should be withheld and when. At the same time, advance directives for severe dementia face serious challenges. Before addressing these, we review the normative force of directives themselves.

AB A meta-analysis of the published research on the effects of child sexual abuse (CSA) was undertaken for 6 outcomes: posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, suicide, sexual promiscuity, victim-perpetrator cycle, and poor academic performance. Thirty-seven studies published between 1981 and 1995 involving 25,367 people were included. Many of the studies were published in 1994 (24; 65%), and most were done in the United States (22: 59%). All six dependent variables were coded, and effect sizes (d) were computed for each outcome. Average unweighted and weighted ds for each of the respective outcome variables were .50 and .40 for PTSD, .63 and .44 for depression, .63 and .44 for suicide, .59 and .29 for sexual promiscuity, .41 and .16 for victim-perpetrator cycle, and .24 and .19 for academic performance. A file drawer analysis indicated that 277 studies with null ds would be required to negate the present findings. The analyses provide clear evidence confirming the link between CSA and subsequent negative short- and long-term effects on development. There were no statistically significant differences on ds when various potentially mediating variables such as gender, socioeconomic status, type of abuse, age when abused, relationship to perpetrator, and number of abuse incidents were assessed. The results of the present mete-analysis support the multifaceted model of traumatization rather than a specific sexual abuse syndrome of CSA.

AB Within the interpersonal theory of suicide (Joiner, 2005; Van Orden et al., 2010), the experience of thwarted belongingness (akin to, "I am alone") and perceived burdensomeness (akin to, "I am a burden") is considered necessary for suicidal desire. Researchers describe suicide as being the most extreme form of experiential avoidance. Yet, the relevancy of experiential avoidance and other central processes of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), such as cognitive fusion, to thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness remain unexamined. This study examined the relevancy of experiential avoidance, cognitive fusion, and their interactive effect in relation to thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness among United States community adults (N =352) recruited through the internet. As predicted, experiential avoidance and cognitive fusion interacted in relation to perceived burdensomeness. The pattern of the interaction indicated that experiential avoidance and cognitive fusion both shared a stronger association with perceived burdensomeness at high, relative to low, scores of the other ACT process. The interaction was unaccounted for by demographic variables, hopelessness, or depressive symptoms. Contrary to predictions, the interaction was not found in relation to thwarted belongingness. Results indicate that the aggregate effect of experiential avoidance and cognitive fusion may be relevant to perceived burdensomeness. Conceptual and therapeutic implications are discussed.

AB Objectives. We investigated associations between minority sexual orientation and mortality among US men.
   Methods. We used data from a retrospective cohort of 5574 men aged 17 to 59 years, first interviewed in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (NHANES III; 1988-1994) and then followed for mortality status up to 18 years later. We classified men into 3 groups: those reporting (1) any same-sex sexual partners (men who have sex with men [MSM]; n=85), (2) only female sexual partners (n=5292), and (3) no sexual partners (n=197). Groups were then compared for all-cause mortality, HIV-related mortality, suicide-related mortality, and non HIV-related mortality.
   Results. Compared with heterosexual men, MSM evidenced greater all-cause mortality. Approximately 13% of MSM died from HIV-related causes compared with 0.1% of men reporting only female partners. However, mortality risk from non HIV-related causes, including suicide, was not elevated among MSM.
   Conclusions. In the United States, the HIV epidemic continues to be the major contributing factor for premature death rates among MSM. Cohorts such as the NHANES III offer a unique opportunity to track the effects of the HIV epidemic on this population. (Am J Public Health. 2011;101:1133-1138. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2010.300013)

AB Background Bullying victimization is common among adolescents and increases the likelihood of depressive symptoms and suicidality. Two previous meta-analyses have shown that these relationships do not significantly vary by gender.
   Objectives This research investigated whether there are significant positive additive interactions between bullying victimization and female gender on depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide attempts that required treatment.
   Methods For this research, analyses of pooled data from the 2011, 2013, and 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (N = 44,632) were performed to estimate measures of additive interaction, as well as measures of multiplicative interaction in order to examine whether the relationship between bullying victimization and depressive symptoms or suicidality significantly varied by gender.
   Results Measures of additive interaction show that the magnitude of the relationship between bullying victimization and depressive symptoms or suicidality is significantly greater among female than male individuals. In contrast, measures of multiplicative interaction indicate that the magnitude of the relationship between bullying and depressive symptoms or suicidality is not significantly greater among female than male individuals.
   Discussion Measures of additive interaction are relevant for nursing and population health research. Future research should further explore how and why bullying victimization appears to more profoundly affect female individuals more than male individuals and how to mitigate it.

AB Objective: This study aimed to determine the 12-month and lifetime prevalence of major depressive episode (MDE) and their socio-demographic correlates in both the urban and rural areas of Beijing, China.
   Methods: A total of 4767 adults were randomly selected and interviewed in Beijing using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 1.0). Basic socio-demographic and clinical data were collected during the interviews.
   Results: The overall 12-month prevalence of MDE was 3.2%; 2.8% and 3.8% for men and women, respectively. The overall lifetime prevalence of MDE was 5.3%; 4.4% and 6.3% for men and women, respectively. Being older than 25 years of age was independently associated with increased risk of MDE. Sixteen point three percent of the subjects with lifetime MDE attempted suicide while the rate of suicide attempts was only 0.2% in subjects without MDE. The percentage of subjects with MDE who received any type of treatment from medical practitioners was 33.1%; of them, only 5.4% sought help from mental health professionals.
   Conclusions: National epidemiologic Surveys are needed to further explore the prevalence of MDE in China. The low percentage of subjects treated for MDE constitutes a major public health problem that should be urgently addressed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB There is widespread concern about possible long-term health effects among women who have received breast implants for cosmetic purposes; few studies have reported on the mortality patterns of such women. The authors examined cause-specific mortality in a cohort of 24,558 women with breast implants and 15,893 women who underwent other plastic surgery procedures in Ontario and Quebec, Canada, between 1974 and 1989. Deaths through 1997 were identified through linkage to the national mortality database. The authors compared the mortality of women who received implants with that of the general population by using standardized mortality ratios; Poisson regression was used to perform internal cohort comparisons. Overall mortality was lower among women who received breast implants relative to the general population (standardized mortality ratio = 0.74, 95% confidence interval: 0.68, 0.81). In contrast, higher suicide rates were observed in both the implant (standardized mortality ratio = 1.73, 95% confidence interval: 1.31, 2.24) and other plastic surgery (standardized mortality ratio = 1.55, 95% confidence interval: 1.07, 2.18) patients. No differences in mortality were found between the implant and other surgeries group for any of the 20 causes of death examined. Findings suggest that breast implants do not directly increase mortality in women. Further work is needed to evaluate risk factors for suicide among women who undergo elective cosmetic surgery.

AB Study objective: To identify critical emergency medicine-focused firearm injury research questions and develop an evidence-based research agenda.
   Methods: National content experts were recruited to a technical advisory group for the American College of Emergency Physicians Research Committee. Nominal group technique was used to identify research questions by consensus. The technical advisory group decided to focus on 5 widely accepted categorizations of firearm injury. Subgroups conducted literature reviews on each topic and developed preliminary lists of emergency medicine-relevant research questions. In person meetings and conference calls were held to iteratively refine the extensive list of research questions, following nominal group technique guidelines. Feedback from external stakeholders was reviewed and integrated.
   Results: Fifty-nine final emergency medicine-relevant research questions were identified, including questions that cut across all firearm injury topics and questions specific to self-directed violence (suicide and attempted suicide), intimate partner violence, peer (nonpartner) violence, mass violence, and unintentional ("accidental") injury. Some questions could be addressed through research conducted in emergency departments; others would require work in other settings.
   Conclusion: The technical advisory group identified key emergency medicine-relevant firearm injury research questions. Emergency medicine-specific data are limited for most of these questions. Funders and researchers should consider increasing their attention to firearm injury prevention and control, particularly to the questions identified here and in other recently developed research agendas.

AB The constitutional law of abortion stands on the untenable assumption that any state's abortion regulations impact citizens of that state alone. On this understanding, the state's boundaries demarcate the terrain on which women's right to abortion clashes with state power to regulate that right.
   This Article uncovers a previously unnoticed horizontal dimension of abortion regulation: the medical-malpractice penalties imposed upon doctors for failing to inform patients about abortion risks; the states' power to define those risks, along with doctors' informed-consent obligations and penalties; and, critically, the possibility that such standards might cross state lines. Planned Parenthood v. Casey and other decisions that have approved abortion-specific informed-consent requirements have failed to account for this interstate dynamic.
   In recent years, fourteen states, led by South Dakota, have enacted statutes that direct doctors to warn patients, as part of an informed-consent dialogue, that abortion might cause depression and even suicide ideation and actual suicide. Although there is broad medical consensus that such warnings are unnecessary, courts have nonetheless concluded that the Supreme Court's Casey decision shields them from constitutional challenge. This may have implications not just in the states that mandate such warnings, but nationwide. Because doctors' informed-consent obligations incorporate medical information and practices from other jurisdictions, a doctor's failure to warn a patient about postabortion depression may expose her to liability for medical malpractice even where her own state does not mandate such a warning statutorily. Eliminating this risk by warning a patient that abortion might lead to depression costs the doctor much less than the penalties she might incur for withholding that information.
   This dynamic which we term the "South Dakota effect" threatens to transform informed-consent practices across the country, with profound consequences for women's willingness to elect abortion and for the experiences of women who choose to go forward with abortion procedures. More broadly, it highlights the need to rethink the abortion-federalism nexus.

ID PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE; UNITED-STATES; NETHERLANDS
AB In the project 'Support and consultation in Euthanasia in Amsterdam' (SCEA) general practitioners can turn to 20 especially trained physicians for advice or consultation concerning euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. In this study the implementation was evaluated and it was investigated whether the goals of SCEA. supporting physicians and improving the quality of consultation, the quality of decision-making and the willingness to report. were met. Methods used were a questionnaire send to all general practitioners ls registered in Amsterdam (n = 398). registration forms SCEA physicians filled in for every time SCEA was contacted and records of the public prosecutor. After the study period of 14 months. of the general practitioners who had performed euthanasia during this period. 53% had contacted SCEA at least once. The vast majority of general practitioners felt supported bq SCEA. The quality of consultation was: (even) higher in cases of euthanasia in which a SCEA physician acted as consultant than in cases with another consultant. We found no relation between use of SCEA and the last two goals of SCEA. Conclusions: Whether the lack of relation found between SCEA and it's last two goals is real or due to the studies limitations remains unclear. The results of this study do suggest that SCEA. by further improving the quality of consultation, has contributed to the safeguarding of euthanasia and assisted suicide. Therefore, similar networks are being developed throughout the Netherlands. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives. The mortality rate of a street-recruited homeless youth cohort in the United States has not yet been reported. We examined the six-year mortality rate for a cohort of street youth recruited from San Francisco street venues in 2004.
   Methods. Using data collected from a longitudinal, venue-based sample of street youth 15-24 years of age, we calculated age, race, and gender-adjusted mortality rates.
   Results. Of a sample of 218 participants, 11 died from enrollment in 2004 to December 31, 2010. The majority of deaths were due to suicide and/or substance abuse. The death rate was 9.6 deaths per hundred thousand person-years. The age, race and gender-adjusted standardized mortality ratio was 10.6 (95% CI [5.3-18.9]). Gender specific SMRs were 16.1 (95% CI [3.3-47.1]) for females and 9.4 (95% CI [4.0-18.4]) for males.
   Conclusions. Street-recruited homeless youth in San Francisco experience a mortality rate in excess of ten times that of the state's general youth population. Services and programs, particularly housing, mental health and substance abuse interventions, are urgently needed to prevent premature mortality in this vulnerable population.

AB Though gun violence is a global issue, the risk of firearm death is substantially higher in the United States than in other high-income nations. Guns are deeply rooted within American culture; however, different subcultures exist along the urban-rural divide. Such differences between urban and rural communities related to gun culture have been dubbed firearm localism. We investigated firearm localism in a state that has the highest proportion of firearm-related domestic violence homicide and a large rural area representing a subgroup of rural culture: Appalachia. Specifically, key professionals reported issues related to domestic violence gun control in their communities. We conducted phone and in-person surveys with a sample of community professionals (N=133) working in victim services and the justice system in urban and Appalachian communities. Despite evidence of a strong gun culture in the rural communities, both urban and rural professionals estimated that about two-thirds of their community would support restricting abusers' firearm access. Additionally, rural professionals were more likely to show concern for abusers' Second Amendment rights when discussing unintended negative consequences of gun confiscation; urban professionals were more likely to point out that gun confiscation can provide a false sense of security for victims. Policy implications are discussed.

TI The Homecomings: What Happens When Arab Foreign Fighters in Iraq and
   Syria Return?
SO STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM
LA English
DT Article
AB What threat do foreign Arab jihadists returning from the war in Syria and Iraq pose to their home states and the broader Arab world? Foreign fighters come back as hardened veterans, steady in the face of danger and skilled in the use of weapons and explosives. While in the conflict zone, they will form networks with other radicals, embrace techniques like suicide bombings and beheadings, and establish ties to jihadists around the world. Different countries have different mitigating factors that limit the danger. The presence or absence of strong and focused security services is particularly important. Returnees' ambition, regional focus, lack of discipline, and brutality often mean they create more enemies than they vanquish and anger local populations. Most terrorism will be locally and regionally focused, with international terrorism probably less of a priority. Area regimes can reduce the risk of bleedout by hindering the travel of volunteers and constraining their ability to organize, stressing the internecine nature of the violence in the Sunni Muslim community, and developing effective de-radicalization programs. Regional and international cooperation to monitor and disrupt travel is also valuable. Many regimes, however, are also likely to take advantage of the jihadists' presence to gain more support from the United States, delay democratic reforms, and crackdown on non-jihadist opposition. Improving intelligence sharing and offensive counterintelligence is important, and the United States can play an important facilitating role.

AB Background: Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular protozoan parasite with zoonotic potential that causes acute and chronic diseases, which has been associated with schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, and suicidal behavior. Military personnel may be at increased risk for exposure to the parasite when deployed to countries with high prevalence rates. Methods: Women Veterans were recruited to participate in the study at an event to recognize women Veterans and later through e-mails. Blood samples were collected from 70 women Veterans (mean age: 47 years) and analyzed for T. gondii IgG titer. Participants completed a demographic instrument, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale, Profile of Mood States (POMS), and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Military. Results: The infectivity rate was lower than the rate in the United States (11.4% [8 out of 70 were seropositive], but 6 of the 8 [75%] had been deployed outside the United States. Pearson correlations and t tests showed significant relationships between T. gondii seropositivity and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression score), POMS-depression, POMS-confusion, and POMS-anger subscale scores, and total mood disturbance score. Conclusions: This study is the first to describe biobehavioral relationships between chronic T. gondii infection, depression, and dysphoric moods in a military veteran population.

AB Objectives: The increasing prevalence of mental health and/or substance use disorders in older adults is a significant public health issue affecting their health, health care use, and health care outcomes. These disorders are especially prevalent in emergency department (ED) visits. This study examined the effect of mental health and substance use disorders on older adults' ED presenting problems and outcomes.
   Methods: Data were from the publicly available 2012 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample data set (unweighted n = 5,344,743 visits by the 65+ years age group). We used binary logistic regression analysis to test relationships between mental health and substance use disorders and suicide attempts, falls, and other injuries and multinomial logistic regression analysis to test relationships between the disorders and ED outcomes of death, hospital admission, transfer to institutional care, home health care, leaving against medical advice (AMA), or other or unknown destinations, as opposed to routine care.
   Results: Of ED visits by older adults, 5.1% involved anxiety disorders, 7.1% involved mood disorders, 10.45% involved delirium/dementia, 1.4% involved alcohol use disorders, and 0.6% involved drug use disorders; 0.2% were suicide-related, 12.0% involved falls, and 10.2% involved other injuries. Mental health and substance use disorders had large-to-medium effects on suicide attempts. Both dementia and delirium and alcohol use disorders had a small effect on falls. Drug use disorders had a small effect on other injuries. Anxiety disorder had a small effect on the risk of death in the ED or in the hospital, relative to routine care. Suicide attempts and drug use disorders had a medium effect on hospital admission. Suicide attempts had a large effect, delirium and dementia and other mental disorders had medium effects, and mood disorder had a small effect on the risk of transfer to another facility. Delirium and dementia, suicide attempts, and drug use disorders had small effects on the risk of discharge with home health care. Alcohol use disorders and drug use disorders had a small effect on the risk of leaving AMA. Finally, suicide attempts had a medium effect on the risk of other outcomes and unknown destinations.
   Conclusions: Late-life mental health and substance use disorders are significant risk factors for both intentional self-harm and unintentional injuries that bring older adults to the ED and contribute to ED dispositions and outcomes that involve more intensive and longer-term health care services. The findings underscore the importance of detection and treatment of these disorders among older adults before they end up in the ED. (C) 2015 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine

TI CDC's national violent death reporting system: Background and
   methodology
SO INJURY PREVENTION
LA English
DT Article
ID FIREARM; MANNER
AB Objectives: This paper describes a new surveillance system called the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), initiated by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. NVDRS's mission is the collection of detailed, timely information on all violent deaths.
   Design: NVDRS is a population based, active surveillance system designed to obtain a complete census of all resident and occurrent violent deaths. Each state collects information on its own deaths from death certificates, medical examiner/coroner files, law enforcement records, and crime laboratories. Deaths occurring in the same incident are linked. Over 270 data elements can be collected on each incident.
   Setting: The 13 state health departments of Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia, and Wisconsin.,
   Subjects: Cases consist of violent deaths from suicide, homicide, undetermined intent, legal intervention, and unintentional firearm injury. Information is collected on suspects as well as victims.
   Interventions: None.
   Outcome measures: The quality of surveillance will be measured in terms of its acceptability, accuracy, sensitivity, timeliness, utility, and cost.
   Results: The system has just been started. There are no results as yet.
   Conclusions: NVDRS has achieved enough support to begin data collection efforts in selected states. This system will need to overcome the significant barriers to such a large data collection effort. Its success depends on the use of its data to inform and assess violence prevention efforts. If successful, it will open a new chapter in the use of empirical information to guide public policy around violence in the United States.

AB Several known risk factors for nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), such as negative emotionality and deficits in emotion skills, are also associated with masculinity. Researchers and clinicians suggest that masculine norms around emotional control and self-reliance may make men more likely to engage in self-harm. Masculinity has also been implicated as a potential risk factor for suicide and other self-damaging behaviors. However, the association between masculinity and NSSI has yet to be explored. In the current study, a sample of 912 emerging adults from two universities in the Northeastern United States completed a web-based questionnaire assessing adherence to masculine norms, engagement in NSSI, and known risk factors for NSSI (demographics and number of self-injurers known). Stronger adherence to masculine norms predicted chronic NSSI (five or more episodes throughout the life span) above and beyond other known risk factors. Adherence to masculine norms was related to methods of NSSI. Clinical implications are discussed, including discussions of masculine norms in treatment settings. Future research should examine what specific masculine norms are most closely linked to NSSI and other self-damaging behaviors.

AB Objective: Through a holistic health lens, the current study examines the effects of weight-related issues and stress on suicidality while controlling for depressive symptoms in college students. Participants: In total, 872 undergraduate and graduate students at DePaul University completed the American College Health Association-National College Health Assessment II Web-based survey in Spring 2010. Methods: Measures of suicidality, depression, weight-related issues, and life stressors were assessed, along with gender differences. Results: Females reported experiencing more weight loss attempts and total stressors than males. Weight-related issues and stress both significantly predicted depressive symptoms in a path analysis; depressive symptoms, in turn, significantly predicted suicidality. Gender differences were found; depressive symptoms mediate the relation between stress and suicidal behavior for females but not for males. Implications: This investigation furthers previous research on suicidality in college students and suggests that all-inclusive interventions that address weight-related issues and stress may help reduce depressive symptoms, which then may reduce suicidal behavior.

AB Since 1989, widely circulating statistics on gay teen suicide in the United States have acted as catalysts for institutional reforms, scientific research, and the creation of an identity category "gay youth." While one figure has been replicated scientifically, these numbers originated not from a scientific research study but as risk estimates developed by a social worker and published in a government document. Many people within the public took up these original numbers, attributing their author the status of scientific researcher. In effect, the numbers became "black boxed," often traveling without citation. Drawing on Ian Hacking's "dynamic nominalist" perspective, this article utilizes interviews with the author of these statistics and other key claimants, along with textual analysis, to trace the origins, uptake, and effects of these figures. While making vital policy contributions, the numbers have led to some ironic consequences including the fostering of gay youth identification with suicide as a potential correlate of their identity and the potential antigay redeployment of decontextualized numbers. They have also led to a reaction in the form of "resilience" narratives.

AB Objective: This study examined the association between mental disorders, prior suicidality, and access to guns and gun safety in the U. S. population. Methods: Using data from adult participants (N=5,692) from the National Comorbidity Survey: Replication (NCS-R), this study examined relationships between mental disorders, past suicidality, and gun access and safety practices. Results: Individuals with lifetime mental disorders (N=3,528) were as likely as those without (N=2,034) to have access to a gun (34.1% versus 36.3%; odds ratio [OR]=. 9, 95% confidence interval [CI]=.8-1.1), carry a gun (4.8% versus 5.0%; OR=1.0, CI=.7-1.40), or store a gun in an unsafe manner (6.2% versus 7.3%; OR=. 9, CI=.51.4). However, individuals with a prior suicide attempt were less likely than those without such an attempt to have access to a gun (23.8% versus 36.0%; OR=.6, CI=.5-.8). Conclusions: Given the previously established relationship between mental health risk factors and suicide, this study highlights the need to assess for gun access among high-risk individuals.

AB This analysis examines the complexity of adolescent health risk behaviors using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), a nationally representative study of students. The Current sample includes 12,955 students (6,626 females and 6,329 males) in grades 9 through 12. Cluster analysis was conducted separately by gender to examine the interrelationships among eight health risk behaviors: sexual activity, general alcohol use, binge drinking, cigarette use, marijuana use, other illicit drug use, fighting, and suicide. Four distinct clusters for females and males were identified based on their profiles of risk-taking behavior Females and males both report low- and high-risk profiles, and a risk profile with high alcohol use and sexual activity. Females have two distinct risk profiles, one that is highest on every measure of risk compared to others and one that has high levels of fighting and suicide with little participation in substance use or sexual activity Males have a distinct risk profile with particularly high rates of marijuana use and suicidal behaviors. Few distinctions exist between profiles based on sociodemographic characteristics.

AB Numerous studies have demonstrated that coercive control is more strongly associated with suicidal ideation than other forms of intimate partner violence. However, a majority of these studies focused on samples of help-seeking women. This study examined whether coercive control remains the form of intimate partner violence most strongly associated with suicidal ideation within a sample of nonclinical dating couples. This cross-sectional, survey study on 104 dating couples examined the associations of coercive control (i.e., dominance/intimidation and restrictive engulfment) with suicidal ideation, while controlling for other forms of emotional abuse (i.e., hostile withdrawal and denigration), physical assault, and depressive symptoms. As expected, dominance/intimidation and depressive symptoms, but not denigration and physical assault, were associated with suicidal ideation. Contrary to our hypothesis, hostile withdrawal, but not restrictive engulfment, was associated with suicidal ideation. This study suggests that dominance/intimidation and hostile withdrawal are forms of emotional abuse that are pertinent to suicidal ideation in nonclinical dating couples.

AB Suicide risk (SR) has been associated to several factors; one of them is the presence of psychiatric disorders. This study has the objective of investigating the relationship between the risk factors for suicidal behavior in patient bearers of chronic renal illness who are undertaking hemodialysis treatment. Sixty-nine undertook a short, structured diagnostic interview. The prevalence of some psychiatric disorders showed itself greater in the sample than that in the population in general. A significant positive correlation was found between SR, major depressive episode, and agoraphobia without panic disorder. The religiosity of the patient was also evaluated as an influencing factor of SR. Nonreligious patients had 8 times more chance to have SR compared to religious patients. However, the referred effect only occurred in nondepressed religious patients. The latter indicated that religiosity had its effect annulled in depressed patients. This study shows the importance of measures of intervention in mental health, mainly in relation to prevention and treatment of major depressive episode with a view to reducing SR.

AB Belgium legalised voluntary euthanasia in 2002, thus ending the long isolation of the Netherlands as the only country in which doctors could openly give lethal injections to patients who have requested help in dying. Meanwhile in Oregon, in the United States, doctors may prescribe drugs for terminally ill patients, who can use them to end their life - if they are able to swallow and digest them. But despite President Bush's oft-repeated statements that his philosophy is to 'trust individuals to make the right decisions' and his opposition to 'distant bureaucracies' his administration is doing its best to prevent Oregonians acting in accordance with a law that its voters have twice ratified. The situation regarding voluntary euthanasia around the world is therefore very much influx..
   This essay reviews ethical arguments regarding voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide from, a utilitarian perspective. I shall begin by asking why it is normally wrong to kill an innocent person, and whether these reasons apply to aiding a person who, when rational and competent, asks to be killed or given the means to commit suicide. Then I shall consider more specific utilitarian arguments for and against permitting voluntary euthanasia.

They give special attention to well-being, religious coping, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety, depression, and suicide, and consider the extent to which hope is a mediator of the purported salutary effects of religiousness. Studies were selected from the comprehensive and systematic review of 20th-century scientific literature concerning religion and health. Authors also review current studies relevant to religion and end-of-life issues. Religious persons reported generally higher levels of well-being. The review also found fairly consistent inverse associations of religiousness with rates of depression and suicide. There was some negative association between religious participation and cognitive dysfunction, but the association with anxiety was inconsistent, with some studies showing a correlation between higher levels of religion and anxiety. Religions effects on mental health are generally protective in direction but modest in strength.

AB Background Strengthening social integration could prevent suicidal behavior. However, minimal research has examined social integration through relationship network structure. To address this important gap, we tested whether structural characteristics of school networks predict school rates of ideation and attempts. Methods In 38 US high schools, 10,291 students nominated close friends and trusted adults to construct social networks. We used mixed-effects logistic regression models to test individual student networks and likelihood of suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SA); and linear regression models to estimate associations between school network characteristics and school rates of SI, SA, and SA among all with ideation. Results Lower peer network integration and cohesion increased likelihood of SI and SA across individual and school-level models. Two factors increased SA: student isolation from adults and suicidal students' popularity and clustering. A multivariable model identified higher SA in schools where youth-adult relationships were concentrated in fewer students (B = 4.95 [1.46, 8.44]) and suicidal students had higher relative popularity versus nonsuicidal peers (B = 0.93 [0.10, 1.77]). Schools had lower SA rates when more students named the same trusted adults named by friends and many students named the same trusted adults. When adjusting for depression, violence victimization and bullying, estimates for adult network characteristics were substantially unchanged whereas some peer effects decreased. Conclusions Schoolwide peer and youth-adult relationship patterns influence SA rates beyond individual student connections. Network characteristics associated with suicide attempts map onto three theory-informed domains: social integration versus thwarted relational needs, group cohesion, and suicidal students' social influence. Network interventions addressing these processes, such as maximizing youth-adult connections schoolwide and heightening influence of youth with healthy coping, could create more protective schools. Longitudinal and intervention studies are needed to determine how schools differentiate in network structure and clarify reciprocal dynamics between network characteristics and suicidal behavior.

TI Alarming Trends in Mortality from Firearms Among United States
   Schoolchildren
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Firearms; Mortality; United States schoolchildren
AB BACKGROUND:<bold> </bold>Mortality from firearms among US schoolchildren is an increasingly major clinical and public health crisis. We explored temporal trends in mortality from firearms among US schoolchildren from 1999 to 2017 by age and race. <bold> </bold>METHODS: We used the Multiple Cause of Death Files of the United States National Center for Health Statistics; PubMed searches, and joinpoint regressions for trend analyses and calculated mortality rates and 95% confidence limits. <bold> </bold>RESULTS: From 1999 to 2017, the 38,942 deaths due to firearms in school-age children ranged from 340 per year at ages 5-14 to 2050 at 15-18 years. One epidemic among 5- to 14-year-olds began in 2009 and another among 15- to 18-year-olds began in 2014. The listed intents were 61% assault, 32% suicide, 5% accidental, and 2% undetermined. Blacks accounted for 41% of overall deaths, but only 17% of the school-age deaths. 86% of all deaths were boys. <bold> </bold>CONCLUSIONS: Mortality from firearms in US schoolchildren is increasing at alarming rates, especially among blacks and those aged 15-18 years. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to quantify these recent epidemics. Although federal laws prohibited them until recently, analytic studies designed a priori to do so are necessary to test the hypotheses generated by these descriptive data. We believe that combatting the epidemic of mortality from firearms among US schoolchildren without addressing firearms is analogous to combatting the epidemic of mortality from lung cancer from cigarettes without addressing cigarettes.

AB Objective: To study non-cancer-related mortality rates over time and examine the possible causes for several major deaths in patients with oral cavity and oropharyngeal (OC/OP) cancer.
   Design: Retrospective cohort analysis using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry data of the National Cancer Institute.
   Main Outcome Measure: Cause-specific mortality rates during the first year after diagnosis of OC/OP cancer were calculated for 4 cohorts (1980-1984, 1990-1994, 2000-2003, and 2004-2007). The percentage changes over time were calculated. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for suicide, cardiovascular disease, and pneumonia were calculated and compared with patient demographic and clinical characteristics.
   Results: We analyzed data for 32 487 patients in 4 cohorts. From 1980-1984 to 2004-2007, mortality from suicide increased by 406.2% (P = .01), cardiovascular disease-related and pneumonia-related mortality decreased by 45.9% (P < .001) and 42.9% (P = .009), respectively, and rates of other non-cancer-related deaths did not change. Compared with the general population, patients diagnosed as having OC/OP cancer were at a significantly higher risk of mortality from suicide (SMR, 7.8; 95% CI, 4.6-12.4; P < .001), cardiovascular disease (SMR, 2.4; 95% CI, 2.1-2.7; P < .001), and pneumonia (SMR, 8.9; 95% CI, 6.8-11.5; P < .001) during the first year after cancer diagnosis. Risk factors for increased mortality included age of 55 to 64 years, marital status (including never married, divorced, or separated), advanced tumor stage (including regional and distant disease), treatment with radiotherapy alone, and pharyngeal tumor location.
   Conclusions: Suicide rates have significantly increased in patients with OC/OP cancer since 1980 to 1984. Although cardiovascular disease- and pneumonia-related deaths have significantly decreased over time, they remain higher than the general US population. Increased knowledge of risk factors associated with non-cancer-related mortality in OC/OP cancer may lead to early intervention and enhanced overall survival.

AB Report II presents a review of the literature on suicidal behavior (SB) of patients with certain somatic diseases. It was shown that co-morbidly ill patients with SB were more socially maladjusted. Somatic suffering makes the patient more vulnerable to micro-social conflicts, often associated with a sense of burden, loneliness and pain, reducing the threshold of fear of death. In cancer, the risk of suicide is 2-4 times higher compared to the general population. In Western Europe and the United States, 0.2-0.5% of deaths of cancer patients are caused by suicide. At the same time, up to 50% of suicides occur when diagnosed with a localized and potentially curable disease. Among the victims of suicides in Russia, there are <= 0.5% cancer patients with male female ratio of 4:1 and mean age of 67 years. At the same time, it is possible that only <1/3 of suicides are actually registered. The risk of suicide is higher for white male husbands, who suffer worse pain and functional limitations. The level of suicide mortality increases with the age of diagnosis - higher in the older (55-65 years), the highest - at the age of >= 80 years. Personality disorders are recorded in 50% of suicidal cancer patients. In 20% of patients receiving palliative care, SB (including suicidal attempts) were detected before the diagnosis of cancer. The risk of suicide with depressive cancer patients is not 2-4 times higher, but 25 times higher. The prevalence of clinical depression among cancer patients is 5-40%. The "critical period" of suicide for men (more often) and women is the first 1-2 years after the diagnosis. The first year accounts for 40% of suicides. The risk factors among these patients are: chronic and poorly controlled pain, metastasis, treatment failure, limitation of self-care. The risk group also includes people who refuse treatment. 20% of patients report suicidal thoughts and hopelessness. The majority of patients thinking about death will not commit suicide, but 50-60% of those who committed suicide shared their suicidal thoughts (plans) with their relatives and medical staff. Almost half (45%) of oncologists are confronted with SB of cancer patients, which indicates its prevalence, but only in isolated cases there is an active survey of patients for this topic. The majority (62%) of oncologists believe that active identification of suicidal ideation may provoke suicide of patients. Among the ways of suicide, self-hanging and poisoning dominate, including an overdose of analgesics and sedatives; it usually happens at home and is planned. More than <1/4> patients think about euthanasia. Lung disease. The risk of SB increases in COPD (men), pneumonia. With bronchial asthma there is a fourfold increase in the risk of suicide attempts. Cardiovascular diseases. Patients with chronic heart failure have the highest association with psychiatric diseases. Persons with implantation of a cardiostimulator, often young and middle-aged, have the highest suicide mortality rates. When making a suicidal attempt by self-poisoning in 12.6-13.5% hypotensive and anti-arrhythmic drugs are used (general population). Gastrointestinal diseases. After gastrectomy for peptic ulcer, suicide was registered in 13.7%, but half of the victims suffered from alcoholism. With gastrointestinal bleeding, the risk of suicide increases 3.4-4.5 times, which is also associated with alcohol problems of the contingent. The risk of SB is significant in case of kidney diseases and renal failure.
   The risk of depression and SB increases as the level of glomerular filtration decreases and persists even after its correction. The risk of suicide increases in the period of the first 3 months of the start of dialysis therapy and grows 25 times in the course of long-term treatment (relative to the general population). Kidney transplantation does not reduce the risk of suicide, possibly due to lifelong treatment and the fear of organ rejection. The share of suicide-related deaths in type I diabetes mellitus can be 7.7%, in type II - 1.3%. AIDS / HIV, especially those associated with the use of surfactants, mental disorders, and social distress, increase the risk of SB by 24-36 times. The risk of suicide in stroke is increased in women and men <60 years 13 and 3-6 times respectively, >60 years - 1.5-2 times. The average time interval between hospitalization and suicide is 1.9 +/- 1.8 years. Spinal cord injuries make up almost fivefold growth of SB. Among deceased patients with spinal cord injury, 4.2% of deaths are related to suicide attempts. Epilepsy (especially temporal) accounts for a fivefold increase in the risk of suicide and 25-fold with resistance to therapy; increased by almost an order of magnitude with concomitant mental disorder, 16 times higher at the onset of the disease before 18 years of age. Suicide may account for 10% of deaths of these patients. Suicides in hospitals. The average age of somatic patients, victims of suicide in a multidisciplinary hospital is 54 while in a psychiatric one it is 41. Somatically, patients are often fall down from a height during hospitalization from 2 days to several months (30 days on average). In somatic hospitals 1/4 suicide victims suffer from the main cause of SB - depression. Only 15% were consulted by a psychiatrist before the tragedy. Conclusion: All illnesses are associated with distress, pain, impairment of functioning, but severe diseases are particularly hard for patients. Apparently, it is essential to find the balance of risk factors and anti-suicidal factors (for example, the internal pattern of the disease determines the rejection of treatment and the hope of healing). Anti-suicidal factors should be identified and strengthened; variable risk factors should be monitored and leveled. The main anti-suicidal factor is adequate therapy. The primary care staff is the key "watchman" in preventing SB. One of the few scientifically proven effective elements of an anti-crisis program is training in identifying depression and SB. The postvention measures (after the patient's SB) are also important in regards to close victims, other patients (bystanders), and professionals. SB prevention means empathy for the sufferer and his family, attention to their immediate and changing needs.

AB Purpose: The objective of this study was to examine the influence of sexual identity and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) on suicidal behaviors in a population-based sample of high school students.
   Methods: A two-stage cluster random sampling design was used to recruit 5,108 students from 97 high schools. A total of 4,955 students (97%) provided information that allowed for classification of sexual identity into three groups: (1) lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) (10%); (2) not sure (4.6%); and (3) heterosexual (85.4%). Five measures of childhood abuse and household dysfunction were summed, and the ACE score was categorized as 0, 1, 2, and 3-5 ACEs. Weighted logistic regression was used to assess the influence of sexual identity, ACEs, and their interaction on suicide ideation and attempts in the past 12 months.
   Results: Compared with heterosexual students, those who were LGB and were not sure had higher odds of suicide ideation and attempts. There was also a graded relationship between cumulative ACE exposure and suicidal behaviors. Although sexual identity/ACE interaction was not observed, LGB/not sure students who experienced a high number of ACEs were disproportionately affected. Compared with heterosexual students with 0 ACE, LGB/not sure students with 0 ACE (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.96-5.61), 1 ACE (AOR = 6.58, 95% CI = 4.05-10.71), 2 ACEs (AOR 13.50, 95% CI = 8.45-21.58), and 3-5 ACEs (AOR = 14.04, 95% CI = 8.72, 22.62) had higher odds of suicide ideation. A similar pattern was observed for suicide attempts.
   Conclusions: LGB and students not sure of their sexual identity with greater exposure to ACEs have disproportionately high levels of suicide ideation and attempts. Trauma-informed interventions for these populations are warranted. (C) 2017 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives. We investigated whether stricter state-level firearm legislation was associated with lower hospital discharge rates for nonfatal firearm injuries.
   Methods. We estimated discharge rates for hospitalized and emergency department-treated nonfatal firearm injuries in 18 states in 2010 and used negative binomial regression to determine whether strength of state firearm legislation was independently associated with total nonfatal firearm injury discharge rates.
   Results. We identified 26 744 discharges for nonfatal firearm injuries. The overall age-adjusted discharge rate was 19.0 per 100 000 person-years (state range = 3.3-36.6), including 7.9 and 11.1 discharges per 100 000 for hospitalized and emergency department-treated injuries, respectively. In models adjusting for differences in state sociodemographic characteristics and economic conditions, states in the strictest tertile of legislative strength had lower discharge rates for total (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.44, 0.82), assault-related (IRR = 0.58; 95% CI = 0.34, 0.99), self-inflicted (IRR = 0.18; 95% CI = 0.14, 0.24), and unintentional (IRR = 0.53; 95% CI = 0.34, 0.84) nonfatal firearm injuries.
   Conclusions. There is significant variation in state-level hospital discharge rates for nonfatal firearm injuries, and stricter state firearm legislation is associated with lower discharge rates for such injuries.

AB Background: Nonmedical use of prescription drugs (NMUPD) is an urgent public health concern facing the United States. Young adults experiencing homelessness (YEH) are at increased risk of NMUPD; however, community estimates of NMUPD among YEH are sparse. This current study sought to understand patterns and correlates of NMUPD in a geographically heterogeneous sample of YEH recruited from seven cities across the United States.
   Methods: From June 2016 to July 2017, 1,426 YEH (aged 18-26) were recruited from seven cities (Houston, Los Angeles, Denver, Phoenix, New York City, St. Louis, San Jose). Participants provided information on substance use, mental health, trauma, and sexual-risk behaviors. Multivariable logistic regression was utilized to assess demographic, psychological, and behavioral correlates of self-reported past-month NMUPD and NMUPD types (i.e., prescription stimulant, sedative, and opioids).
   Results: Approximately 20% of participants reported past-month NMUPD. Almost 9% reported misusing prescription opioids, 8.7% misused prescription sedatives, and 6% misused prescription stimulants. Multivariable logistic regressions revealed unmet mental health needs were associated with sedative and stimulant misuse but not opioid misuse. Having suicidal thoughts was associated with opioid misuse but not sedative or stimulant misuse. Although no geographical differences emerged for stimulant and sedative misuse, youth from Denver, Phoenix, and San Jose were more likely to engage in opioid misuse relative to youth in Los Angeles.
   Conclusions: These findings indicate that interventions designed to address NMUPD need to be multifaceted, designed to address other risk behaviors correlated with NMUPD, and target unmet mental health needs.

   FEATURES
AB Background. Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) has received increased attention in the mental health literature and has been proposed as a diagnostic entity for DSM-5. However, data on NSSI in the United States adult population are lacking.
   Method. The prevalence and nature of NSSI were examined in a random-digit dialing sample of 439 adults in the United States. Participants were recruited during July and August of 2008.
   Results. Lifetime prevalence of NSSI was 5.9%, including 2.7% who had self-injured five or more times. The 12-month prevalence was 0.9%. Methods of NSSI reported included cutting/carving, burning, biting, scraping/scratching skin, hitting, interfering with wound healing and skin picking. Half of self-injurers reported multiple methods. The average age of onset was 16 years (median 14 years). Instances of NSSI infrequently co-occurred with suicidal thoughts and with use of alcohol or drugs and rarely required medical treatment. Most injurers reported that NSSI functioned to alleviate negative emotions. Fewer reported that they self-injured to punish themselves, to communicate with others/get attention or to escape a situation or responsibility. NSSI was associated with younger age, being unmarried and a history of mental health treatment, but not with gender, ethnicity, educational history or household income.
   Conclusions. Results are largely consistent with previous research in adolescent and young adult samples. Study limitations notwithstanding, this study provides the most definitive and detailed information to date regarding the prevalence and characteristics of NSSI in US adults. In the future, it will be important for large-scale epidemiological studies of psychopathology to include questions about NSSI.

AB Black-white mortality disparities remain sizable in the United States. In this study, we use the concept of avoidable/amenable mortality to estimate cause-of-death contributions to the difference in life expectancy between whites and blacks by gender in the United States in 1980, 1993, and 2007. We begin with a review of the concept of "avoidable mortality" and results of prior studies using this cause-of-death classification. We then present the results of our empirical analyses. We classified causes of death as amenable to medical care, sensitive to public health policies and health behaviors, ischemic heart disease, suicide, HIV/AIDS, and all other causes combined. We used vital statistics data on deaths and Census Bureau population estimates and standard demographic decomposition techniques. In 2007, causes of death amenable to medical care continued to account for close to 2 years of the racial difference in life expectancy among men (2.08) and women (1.85). Causes amenable to public health interventions made a larger contribution to the racial difference in life expectancy among men (1.17 years) than women (0.08 years). The contribution of HIV/AIDS substantially widened the racial difference among both men (1.08 years) and women (0.42 years) in 1993, but its contribution declined over time. Despite progress observed over the time period studied, a substantial portion of black-white disparities in mortality could be reduced given more equitable access to medical care and health interventions.

AB Objectives Although injuries are a known cause of morbidity and mortality among children and adolescents, little is known about the epidemiology of injury-related emergency department (ED) visits in the United States by injury intent. The objective of this analysis was to examine ED outcomes, defined as death in the ED, inpatient admission, and visit cost, among ED visits stratified by injury intent (ie, self-harm, assault, and injury with undetermined intent, as compared with unintentional injuries).
   Methods All injury-related ED visits in the United States for children and adolescents, ages 8 to 17 years, were identified using the 2008 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample. Multivariate survey weighted logistic and linear regression analyses were then used to estimate the likelihood of death on ED visit, inpatient admission, and cost across the 4 injury types.
   Results In 2008, with the use of weighted estimates, there were 66,895 self-harm, 176,125 assault, 24,144 undetermined injury, and 4,244,589 unintentional injury ED visits among children 8 to 17 years. Visits due to self-harm, assault and undetermined injuries were more likely to result in death during the ED visit compared with visits due to unintentional injuries. Self-harm and undetermined intent were also associated with greater odds of inpatient admission as well as 90% and 60% higher ED visit costs, respectively.
   Conclusions Data from this nationwide sample of pediatric ED visits highlight the resource burden of self-harm, undetermined intent, and assault injury visits. Pediatric EDs may provide a window of opportunity for better case identification and intervention with children experiencing violence and injury.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to demonstrate the increasing importance of heart disease as a cause of pregnancy-related mortality in Hawaii and the rest of the United States.
   Study Design: Hawaii's Department of Public Health identified all pregnancy-associated death certificates from 1991 to 2007. Hospital records and autopsy reports were reviewed to determine whether deaths were pregnancy-related.
   Result: From 1991 to 2007, Hawaii registered 156 deaths occurring within 1 year of pregnancy, which represented 4.2% of the total number of women who died in the same 17 to 46 years age group and 9.0% of the total number of women who died in the same 17 to 34 years age group. The pregnancy-related mortality ratio was 22.4 and the pregnancy-associated mortality ratio was 50. The leading cause of pregnancy-associated mortality was heart disease (20.5%) followed by cancer (18.6%) and suicide/ homicide (12.2%). Pregnancy-related deaths (n 70) were attributed to heart disease (45.7%) followed by sepsis (14.2%) and hemorrhage (12.9%). The new Hawaii death certificate beginning in 2006 increased the detection of both pregnancy-related and - associated deaths.
   Conclusion: Heart disease is the most common cause of pregnancyrelated mortality in Hawaii, and with improved ascertainment, may be determined to be the most common cause of pregnancy-related mortality in the rest of the United States.

AB Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects a significant number of adolescents today. Its consequences (including social isolation, failure to achieve crucial developmental milestones, and suicide) mandate close attention in clinical practice. While tricyclics and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) have been used infrequently and with questionable efficacy, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), particularly fluoxetine, consistently have been shown to be of benefit in treating outpatient adolescents with MDD. Despite some success with other drugs in its class, fluoxetine remains the only SSRI that is FDA approved for treatment of children and adolescents with depression. A review of recent studies is presented, including the controversy regarding the relationship of antidepressants and suicidal behavior in this patient population.

AB Using both college students and a national sample of adults, the authors report evidence linking the ideology of masculine honor in the U. S. with militant responses to terrorism. In Study 1, individuals' honor ideology endorsement predicted, among other outcomes, open-ended hostile responses to a fictitious attack on the Statue of Liberty and support for the use of extreme counterterrorism measures (e. g., severe interrogations), controlling for right-wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, and other covariates. In Study 2, the authors used a regional classification to distinguish honor state respondents from nonhonor state respondents, as has traditionally been done in the literature, and showed that students attending a southwestern university desired the death of the terrorists responsible for 9/11 more than did their northern counterparts. These studies are the first to show that masculine honor ideology in the U. S. has implications for the intergroup phenomenon of people's responses to terrorism.

The infant mortality rate decreased to a historic low of 5.82 infant deaths per 1000 live births in 2014. The age-adjusted death rate for 2014 was 7.2 deaths per 1000 population, down 1% from 2013. Crude death rates for children aged 1 to 19 years did not change significantly between 2013 and 2014. Unintentional injuries and suicide were, respectively, the first and second leading causes of death in this age group. These 2 causes of death jointly accounted for 46.5% of all deaths to children and adolescents in 2014.

AB Despite the clinical relevance of self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITB) among youth, little is known about the subset of youth most at-risk for SITB. This study examined the moderating roles of gender, racial/ethnic background, and school-level (and their interactions) on rates of SITB within a large (N = 2638, 52.2% female), ethnically-diverse sample of middle- and high-school youth in a relatively poor and underserved area of the Southern United States. Extending extant research in this area, findings indicated a significant interaction between gender and race for self-injurious behaviors, with African-American boys reporting higher rates than all other groups. Findings also indicated significant interactions between school-level and both gender and race for self-injurious thoughts. Whereas comparable levels of self-injurious thoughts were reported across middle- and high-schools for girls and African-American youth, the frequency of these thoughts was higher among both boys and White students in high-school (vs. middle-school). Results highlight the need for further research on SITB among diverse youth in underserved areas.

ID UNITED-STATES; PREVENTION; GUIDELINES; BELIEFS
AB Introduction: Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. An estimated 50% of these deaths are due to firearms. Suicidal ideation (SI) is a common complaint presenting to the emergency department (ED). Despite these facts, provider documentation on access to lethal means is lacking. Our primary aim was to quantify documentation of access to firearms in patients presenting to the ED with a chief complaint of SI.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of consecutive patients, nearly all of whom presented to an academic, urban ED with SI during July 2014. We collected data from all provider documentation in the electronic health record. Primary outcome assessed was whether the emergency physician (EP) team documented access to firearms. Secondary outcomes included demographic information, preexisting psychiatric diagnoses, and disposition.
   Results: We reviewed 100 patient charts. The median age of patients was 38 years. The majority of patients had a psychiatric condition. EPs documented access to firearms in only 3% of patient charts.
   Conclusion: EPs do not adequately document access to firearms in patients with SI. There is a clear need for educational initiatives regarding risk-factor assessment and counseling against lethal means in this patient cohort.

AB At the beginning of each month, there is a spike in government payments to individuals, resulting in a beginning-of-the-month spike in purchases of prescription drugs and in increased pharmacy workloads. Studies suggest that pharmacy error rates increase with increased workloads. These facts raise an important and previously unanswered question: is there a spike in fatal medication errors at the beginning of each month? We examined all United States death certificates from 1979-2000 (> 47,000,000 deaths) and showed that medication error deaths for which the decedent was dead on arrival or died in the emergency room or as an outpatient spiked by 25% above normal at the beginning of each month. This beginning-of-the-month spike (25% 4%) was larger than for any other major cause of death. The beginning-of-the-month spike did not vary by socioeconomic status and was not larger for substance abusers than for others. Five explanations for the findings were tested. Evidence suggested that the spike in medication error deaths cannot be solely attributed to a spike in the consumption of alcohol or drugs. An increase in pharmacy error rates might play a role.

DT Review

ID UNITED-STATES; IMMOLATION; SUICIDE; MORTALITY; RISK; IRAN; EPIDEMIOLOGY;
   PATTERNS
AB Background: Intentional self-inflicted burn injuries are a rare occurrence in the United States, but they represent a considerable portion of all burn injuries in the developing world. Compared to nonintentional burns, patients with intentional self-inflicted burns have increased rates of higher total body surface area involvement and associated complications, including overall mortality. Methods: We present 2 representative cases and review the available literature on the topic of self-inflicted burns. We review epidemiologic, social, and cultural factors of importance, and also provide an overview of most common psychiatric pathologies encountered in patients with self-inflicted burns. Results: The patient demographics and motivation for intentional self-inflicted burn injuries differ considerably across the world. Although self-immolation is commonly associated with women experiencing domestic stress in the developing world, most cases of self-immolation in higher-income countries are males. Psychiatric pathologies, including primary mood and thought disorders and substance use, play a significant component in latter cases, while most patients in the developing world lack any pre morbid psychiatric diagnosis, or carry diagnosis of adjustment disorder. Conclusions: Nonlethal self-burns present a distinct subset of intentional self-burn injuries, often occurring in the context of significant personality pathology, or with potential secondary gain.

AB Objective: Initiatives to curb police abuse in the United States are often viewed as " antipolice" or politically unpopular. Efforts to address police violence may be more acceptable if abusive practices are shown to have an adverse impact on officers themselves. This study investigates potential associations between involvement in abusive policing practices and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among active-duty police officers in the United States. Method: We used Qualtrics Panels to recruit active-duty police officers in the U. S. (N 5 137). Linear regression was used to model associations between abusive police practices and PTSD, adjusting for adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and workplace trauma. Results: Approximately 11% of police officers self-reported involvement in abusive police practices. Abusive police practices were independently associated with higher levels of PTSD symptoms (B 5 0.22, p 5 0.008) even when controlling for ACEs and workplace trauma. Conclusions: Officers who engage in abusive policing are more likely to report PTSD symptoms. Findings suggest that reducing police violence may benefit both officers and civilians. Further, mental health interventions targeting police officers may reduce the likelihood of police abuse.

AB The United States is falling behind many other rich nations on a broad spectrum of measures of the quality of life. These include social mobility, inequality, education, crime, health and longevity. Polls suggest that many Americans have not only lost their optimism concerning the future, but have become angry as well. This article sets forth the elements of a new social contract, one that would deliver substantial results almost overnight and which conforms to the traditional American values of the importance of work, that everyone should have a fair opportunity for upwards mobility, and the central importance of the family. This proposal is composed of two parts: The first is guaranteed employment, and where necessary, the retraining required to enable workers to successfully enter the regular workforce. The second is universal child care to give all parents the possibility of participating in the labor force. The article discusses in depth how these measures would reverse the relative decline in quality of life in America. It also reveals how, although these measures would be costly, their payoff for the economy would far offset the costs. (C) 2018 by The Transformative Studies Institute. All rights reserved.

AB This descriptive study examines twenty years of gasoline-related fatalities and emergency department treated injuries in the United States, based on data from the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. Thermal burns consistently accounted for the majority (56%) of gasoline-related injuries and for most (82%) gasoline-related deaths, and were commonly (57-71%) associated with the use of gasoline as an accelerant. Poisoning accounted for 13% of injuries and 17% of deaths. The primary poisoning injury pattern was ingestion; the primary fatality pattern was inhalation, with about half of those associated with deliberate abuse. The estimated number of ingestions decreased from 60 to 23% of poisoning-related injuries, while injuries associated with inhalation abuse increased from 6 to 23%. Chemical burns and dermatitis were less represented in the injury data and were primarily associated with gasoline spills or splashes.Gasoline cans reportedly ignited or exploded in about 5% of thermal burn injuries and fatalities.While mandatory requirements for child resistant closures on gasoline cans (a primary intervention) have potentially impacted poisonings, the use of flame mitigation devices to address thermal injuries, if successful, would be a secondary intervention, and could address only a small percentage (about 5%) of injuries and deaths.

AB Objective: To evaluate the substances used, outcomes, temporal and demographics associated with suicide attempts by self-poisoning in children and young adults aged 10?25?years old from 2000 to 2018. Methods: This is a retrospective review of suspected-suicide self-poisoning cases reported to the National Poison Data System (NPDS) from US Poison Centers from 2000 to 2018 for patients 10?25?years old. For comparison of annual rates, we obtained population data by year of age from the US Census Bureau. We evaluated changes in: monthly and annual incidence/rate per 100,000 population, substances used and outcome by patient age and demographics. Results: There were 1,677,435 cases of suicide attempt by self-poisoning among individuals 10?25?years old reported to US PCCs from 2000 to 2018. There were 410,940 self-poisoning cases (24.5%) with a serious medical outcome, and the proportion of exposures that resulted in a serious medical outcome increased with increasing age group. For the age groups of 10?12, 13?15 and 16?18?years of age, there was a significant increase after 2011, which was influenced primarily by females. The substance groups with the greatest number of serious medical outcomes were OTC analgesics, antidepressants, antihistamines and antipsychotics. ADHD medications were common in the younger age groups of 10?15?years, while the sedative/hypnotics occurred more commonly in the older age groups. The groups with the greatest increase in serious medical outcomes after 2011 were antidepressants, OTC analgesics, antihistamines and ADHD medications. Opiates were less commonly involved (7.4%) in cases with serious medical outcomes and decreased significantly in the 19?25?year-old age groups after 2012. States with a lower population per square mile had a greater number of reported cases with serious medical outcomes. There was a significant decrease in the number of cases in the age groups of 10?18?years during the traditional non-school months of June?August compared with September?May. This seasonal trend occurred among cases with all outcomes and among cases with serious medical outcomes. This decrease did not occur in the age group of 19?21?years, and there was an increase during summer months in the age group 22?25?years. Conclusions: The substances used during self-poisoning varies by age group but appears to include substances available to that age group, with a significant increase after 2011, increased rates in more rural states, and a seasonal variation of increased rates during school months among adolescents but not among young adults. Two of the top substances, OTC analgesics and antihistamines, in all age groups, comprising more than a third of all substances used, are widely available over-the-counter with no restrictions regarding access. Of additional concern, ADHD medications had the highest risk of a serious medical outcome.

TI Youth risk behavior surveillance - United States, 2001
SO JOURNAL OF SCHOOL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB In the United States, approximately three-fourths of all deaths among persons aged 10-24 years result from only four causes: motor-vehicle crashes, other unintentional injuries, homicide, and suicide. Results from the 2001 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey demonstrated that numerous high school students engage in behaviors that increase their likelihood of death from these four causes: 14.1% had rarely or never worn a seat belt during the 30 days preceding the survey; 30.7% had ridden with a driver who had been drinking alcohol; 17.4% had carried a weapon during the 30 days preceding the survey; 47.1% had drunk alcohol during the 30 days preceding the survey; 23.9% had used marijuana during the 30 days preceding the survey; and 8.8% had attempted suicide during the 12 months preceding the survey. Substantial morbidity and social problems among young persons also result from unintended pregnancies and STDs, including HIV infection. In 2001, 45.6% of high school students had ever had sexual intercourse; 42.1% of sexually active students had not used a condom at last sexual intercourse: and 2.3% had ever injected an illegal drug. Two-thirds of all deaths among persons aged greater than or equal to25 years result from only two causes: cardiovascular disease and cancer. The majority of risk behaviors associated with these No causes of death are initiated during adolescence. In 2001, 28.5% of high school students had smoked cigarettes during the 30 days preceding the survey; 78.6% had not eaten greater than or equal to5 servings per day of fruits and vegetables during the 7 days preceding the survey; 10.5% were overweight; and 67.8% did not attend physical education class daily,
   Health and education officials at national, state, and local levels are using these YRBSS data to analyze and improve policies and programs to reduce priority health-risk behaviors among youth. The YRBSS data also are being used to measure progress toward achieving 16 national health objectives for 2010 and 3 of the 10 leading health indicators.

ID INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE; UNITED-STATES; HOMICIDES; LAWS
AB BackgroundIn the US more than 1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men have experienced severe physical violence by an intimate partner. The most severe violence, violence that ends in death, disproportionately affects women. Current or former male intimate partners commit the majority of homicides of females and fifty to 60 % of these homicides are perpetrated with firearms. Most murder-suicides involve intimate partners and the vast majority of these cases are women murdered by intimate partners using a firearm. Little data exist to illuminate the social and legal circumstances surrounding firearm use in intimate partner homicide. Here we describe US Domestic Violence Fatality Review Teams and the planning and development of a National Clearinghouse for Domestic Violence Fatality Reviews. Among other things, the National Clearinghouse will centrally record and harmonize reviews across the US through standardized reporting templates and protocols for gathering de-identified intimate partner homicide case information.ConclusionDomestic violence fatality reviews provide a promising yet underutilized data source to understand the links between firearms and domestic violence related deaths. The nascent Clearinghouse can inform policy approaches to address intimate partner homicide as well as firearm-related violence in the United States.

AB Eleven years ago, philosopher Robert E. Goodin published No Smoking: The Ethical Issues. Goodin argued that the liberty of smokers can be justifiably limited for two reasons: to prevent harm to third persons and to prevent harm to smokers themselves under circumstances which make their decision to smoke substantially non-autonomous. In this article Thaddeus Pope reexamines the harm principle and the soft paternalism principle in light of more recent legal developments, gives them additional content, and carefully demarcates the justificatory scope of each. Pope also defines and defends a third liberty-limiting principle, hard paternalism, arguing that the liberty of smokers might be justifiably limited even when their decision to smoke is substantially autonomous.

AB Lifespans are both shorter and more variable for blacks than for whites in the United States. Because their lifespans are more variable, there is greater inequality in length of life-and thus greater uncertainty about the future-among blacks. This study is the first to decompose the black-white difference in lifespan variability in America. Are lifespans more variable for blacks because they are more likely to die of causes that disproportionately strike the young and middle-aged, or because age at death varies more for blacks than for whites among those who succumb to the same cause? We find that it is primarily the latter. For almost all causes of death, age at death is more variable for blacks than it is for whites, especially among women. Although some youthful causes of death, such as homicide and HIV/AIDS, contribute to the black-white disparity in variance, those contributions are largely offset by the higher rates of suicide and drug poisoning deaths for whites. As a result, differences in the causes of death for blacks and whites account, on net, for only about one-eighth of the difference in lifespan variance.

AB Stigma operates at multiple levels, including intrapersonal appraisals (e.g., self-stigma), interpersonal events (e.g., hate crimes), and structural conditions (e.g., community norms, institutional policies). Although prior research has indicated that intrapersonal and interpersonal forms of stigma negatively affect the health of the stigmatized, few studies have addressed the health consequences of exposure to structural forms of stigma. To address this gap, we investigated whether structural stigma-operationalized as living in communities with high levels of anti-gay prejudice increases risk of premature mortality for sexual minorities. We constructed a measure capturing the average level of anti-gay prejudice at the community level, using data from the General Social Survey, which was then prospectively linked to all-cause mortality data via the National Death Index. Sexual minorities living in communities with high levels of anti-gay prejudice experienced a higher hazard of mortality than those living in low-prejudice communities (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 3.03, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] I = 1.50, 6.13), controlling for individual and community-level covariates. This result translates into a shorter life expectancy of approximately 12 years (95% C.I.: 4-20 years) for sexual minorities living in high-prejudice communities. Analysis of specific causes of death revealed that suicide, homicide/violence, and cardiovascular diseases were substantially elevated among sexual minorities in high-prejudice communities. Strikingly, there was an 18-year difference in average age of completed suicide between sexual minorities in the high-prejudice (age 37.5) and low-prejudice (age 55.7) communities. These results highlight the importance of examining structural forms of stigma and prejudice as social determinants of health and longevity among minority populations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The adolescents reported daily or more thoughts of historical loss at rates similar to their female caretakers. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that our measure of perceived historical loss and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale were separate but related constructs. Regression analysis indicated that, even when controlling for family factors, perceived discrimination, and proximal negative life events, perceived historical loss had independent effects on adolescent's depressive symptoms. The construct of historical loss is discussed in terms of Indigenous ethnic cleansing and life course theory.

AB Background: Pediatric gunshot wounds remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Recent experience in the urban pediatric population has not been extensively documented.
   Methods: A retrospective review of the trauma registry identified all pediatric (age 0-16 y) gunshot wound injuries between October 1991 and August 2011. We evaluated demographic, injury location, disposition, and outcome data. We applied descriptive statistics and chi(2) with significance level set to P <= 0.05.
   Results: We treated 740 patients at our trauma center. Patients tended to be male (82%) and African American (72%), and most frequently were shot in the abdomen, back, or pelvic regions (26%). Patients with head or neck injuries experienced the highest mortality rate (35%), whereas the mortality rate overall was 12.7%. A total of 23% of patients were discharged directly, but 32% required an operation. We grouped data into five equal time periods, demonstrating that after decreasing through the 1990s, pediatric gunshot wounds presenting to our hospital are steadily increasing.
   Conclusions: We identified certain demographic and temporal trends regarding pediatric gunshot wounds, and the overall number of injuries appears to be increasing. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The United States Park Police investigated the death and concluded that it was a suicide. Since that time, questions have been raised concerning the circumstances surrounding Mr. Foster's death. Following continued speculation, two separate investigations were conducted by Special Counsel Robert B. Fiske and Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr. Each investigation included a search of the area where Mr. Foster's body was found in an attempt to locate the bullet which caused Mr. Foster's death, bone fragments from his skull, gun powder residue, and other evidence relevant to Mr. Foster's death.

AB The purpose of this study is to identify the relationship between outdoor recreation participation and depressive symptoms among individuals with disabilities. The current paper compares three outdoor recreation predictors (dichotomized participation, participation index score, and participation frequencies) to two depression dependents (dichotomized current major depression and raw depression index score). Results reveal a negative relationship between outdoor recreation participation and depression, outdoor recreation participants had lower overall depression scores than nonparticipants, and lower depression scores were related to more frequent outdoor recreation participation. Future experimental studies are needed in order to fully understand the causal relationship between outdoor recreation and depression among different subgroups of individuals with disabilities.

AB We explored the coping behaviors of 15 immigrant African survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) in the United States. Similarities and differences in coping strategies between African and other immigrant women were noted. Results from the qualitative analysis are that African immigrant survivors utilized multiple coping strategies including beliefs in spirituality and divine retribution, a future orientation, and a sense of self-efficacy. Acceptance/endurance of abuse, which they believe was "normal" in male/female relationships; minimization of the abuse; and avoidant behaviors and thoughts also were used. Informal and formal support/help seeking, and knowledge of available services empowered women. Implications for policy, practice, and future research are discussed.

AB Much of the research on the relationships between religious participation and health comes from the United States. Studies in other geographic regions or cultural contexts is more sparse. Evidence presented by Ahrenfelt et al., and that from other research studies, is reviewed concerning the associations between religion and health within Europe and world-wide. The evidence within Europe suggests protective associations between various forms of religious participation and lower depression, lower mortality, and better self-rated health. Methodological challenges in such research are reviewed, and discussion is given as to whether a person-culture-fit explanation suffices to account for the existing data and to what other mechanisms might be operative.

AB Purpose: Indoor tanning is a risk factor for developing melanoma. Although in 2009, 6.7% of male high school students reported using an indoor tanning device, compared with 25.4% of female students (Eaton DK, Kann L, Kinchen S, et al, MMWR Surveill Summ 2010; 59: 1-142), it is also less well characterized in male than in female adolescents.
   Methods: The associations between appearance-related and other health-related behaviors with indoor tanning device use were examined among male high school students in the United States, using the 2009 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey.
   Results: Adjusted analysis of cross-sectional data showed that indoor tanning device use was positively associated with ever having taken steroids without a doctor's prescription, unhealthy weight control practices, binge drinking, eating fruits and vegetables five or more times per day, playing on at least one sports team, and attempted suicide.
   Conclusions: Understanding the relationship between indoor tanning device use and appearance-related and other health-related behaviors is useful in designing risk reduction interventions for skin cancer prevention.

AB The US population has a subset of those that are underserved who are in need of primary care and also suffer from mental health disorders. In this article, categories of underserved populations are described. Each section defines the population being presented, identifies the mental health problems each is likely to encounter, explores the barriers that prevent access to care, and identifies potential methods to minimize such barriers. The ways in which psychiatric issues vary in underserved settings compared with the general population are differentiated. Recommendations are offered for primary care physicians to support improved recognition and management of psychosocial stressors and psychiatric illness among the underserved.

AB Chronic pain affects nearly one-third of the American population. Chronic pain can lead to a variety of problems for a pain sufferer, including developing secondary medical problems, depression, functional and vocational disability, opioid abuse, and suicide. Current pain care models are deficient in providing a necessary comprehensive approach. Most patients with chronic pain are managed by primary care clinicians who are typically ill prepared to effectively and efficiently manage these cases. A biopsychosocial approach to evaluate and treat chronic pain is clinically and economically efficacious, but unique delivery systems are required to meet the challenge of access to specialty care.

AB BACKGROUND Despite the high prevalence of pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, little is known about physicians' views surrounding the ethical and legal aspects of managing these devices at the end of life.
   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to identify physicians' experiences and views surrounding the ethical and legal aspects of managing cardiac devices at the end of life.
   METHODS Survey questions were administered to internal medicine physicians and subspecialists at a tertiary care center. Physicians were surveyed about their clinical experience, legal knowledge, and ethical beliefs relating to the withdrawal of PM and ICD therapy in comparison to other life-sustaining therapies.
   RESULTS Responses were obtained from 185 physicians. Compared to withdrawal of PMs and ICDs, physicians more often reported having participated in the withdrawal or removal of mechanical ventilation (86.1% vs 33.9%, P < .0001), dialysis (60.6% vs 33.9%, P < .001), and feeding tubes (73.8% vs 33.9%, P < .0001). Physicians were consistently less comfortable discussing cessation of PMs and ICDs compared to other life-sustaining therapies (P < .005). Only 65% of physicians correctly identified the legal status of euthanasia in the United States, and 20% accurately reported the legal status of physician-assisted suicide in the United States. Compared to deactivation of an ICD, physicians more often characterized deactivation of a PM in a pacemaker- dependent patient as physician-assisted suicide (19% vs 10%, P = .027) or euthanasia (9% vs 1%, P < .001).
   CONCLUSION In this single-center study, internists were less comfortable discussing cessation of PM and ICD therapy compared to other life-sustaining therapies and lacked experience with this practice. Education regarding the legal and ethical parameters of device deactivation is needed.

AB Introduction
   Poisoning remains a major worldwide public health problem. Mortality varies by country, region and ethnicity. The objective of this study is to analyze recent trends in poisoning mortality in the Mexican population.
   Methods
   Data regarding mortality induced by poisoning was obtained from a publicly available national database maintained by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography.
   Results
   During the period from 2000 to 2012, average mortality rates for unintentional and self-poisoning were 1.09 and 0.41 per 100000 population, respectively. The highest mortality rate for unintentional poisoning was in older individuals of both genders while the highest mortality for self-poisoning was in older men and young women. Additional studies are needed in Mexico, especially those that analyze risk factors in older individuals and young women.

AB This paper explores the role of religious belief in public debate about physician-assisted dying and argues that the role is essential because any discussion about the way we die raises the deepest questions about the meaning of human life and death. For religious people, such questions are essentially religious ones, even when the religious elements are framed in secular political or philosophical language. The paper begins by reviewing some of the empirical data about religious belief and practice in the United States and Europe. It then explores the question of the proper role of religion in public policy debate and concludes with a discussion of the importance of religion and religious practices in considerations of how we die.

As expected, the more severe suicidality groups reported higher levels of depressive symptoms, traumatic distress, and substance abuse symptoms. Findings support the validity of the BHS and its utility as a medical decision tool to help ED staff evaluate the severity of patients' suicidality.

AB The research described in this paper sought to review the public health issues arising from the presence of feral deer, goats and pigs in New Zealand. Key findings were that while recreational hunting of these animals is likely to provide physical and mental health benefits, and contribute to food security, likely health-related harms from these animals include (i) injury risks from the associated firearms used in hunting; (ii) as reservoirs for zoonotic diseases; (iii) reduced mental health benefits of wilderness experience and natural ecosystems; and (iv) likely contribution to flooding risk via forest damage. Further research could better quantify these issues.

AB We surveyed the U.S. non-institutionalized population age 18+ on opinions regarding 23 alcohol control policies (N = 7,021). The cooperation rate among contacted households was 70% and the overall response rate was 54%. Results showed high levels of public support for most alcohol control policies. Over 80% support restrictions on alcohol use in public places, such as parks, beaches, concert venues, and on college campuses. Eighty-two percent support increased alcohol taxes, provided the funds are used for treatment or prevention programs. Over 60% support alcohol advertising and promotion restrictions, such as banning billboard advertising, banning promotion at sporting events, or banning liquor and beer advertising on television.

AB Previous research has revealed that an emotional response to weather might be indicated by calls to telephone counseling services. We analyzed call frequency from such "hotlines", each serving communities in a major metropolitan area of the United States (Detroit, Washington DC, Dallas and Seattle). The periods examined were all, or parts of, the years 1997 and 1998. Associations with subjectively derived synoptic weather types for all cities except Seattle, as well as with individual weather elements [cloudiness (sky cover), precipitation, windspeed, and interdiurnal temperature change] for all four cities, were investigated. Analysis of variance and t-tests (significance of means) were applied to test the statistical significance of differences. Although statistically significant results were obtained in scattered instances, the total number was within that expected by chance, and there was little in the way of consistency to these associations. One clear exception was the increased call frequency during destructive (severe) weather, when there is obvious concern about the damage done by it.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine whether mass shooters' media-reported mental health history and firearm access related to mass shooting severity. The current analysis included a total of 102 mass shooters in the United States between 1982 and 2018 described in media reports. Negative binomial regression analysis was used to assess if a shooter's media-reported mental health history and firearm access were related to mass shooting severity while controlling for age, race, location, weapon attainment legality, and assault rifle use. Results suggest that reported mental health histories, number of weapons brought to the scene of the crime, weapon attainment legality, the use of an assault-style weapon, and location were significantly related to mass shooting severity. Understanding the relationships between gun access, mental health, and mass shooting severity might provide a better foundation for policy development aimed at minimizing mass shootings. Unaddressed mental health issues might increase violence; therefore, reducing mental health stigma might enable more individuals to seek formal evaluations, which could assist violence prevention efforts. Similarly, increased firearm responsibility and safety, whether at the social or legal level, might reduce violence and prevent casualties of mass shootings.

DT Review
DE methanol; epidemiology; intoxication; poisoning; winshield wiper fluid;
   blindness; Parkinson's disease; suicide
AB Objectives: We investigated U.S. methanol-poisoning exposures since little recent information is available about the frequency, sources of methanol, or outcomes of individuals who consume methanol. Methods: We reviewed human methanol exposures reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers Toxic Exposure Surveillance System 1993-1998. Results: The mean number of cases per year was 2254. Each year 167 cases had an outcome of moderate effect, major effect, or death. One death occurred in every, 183 exposures to methanol. Symptomatic cases increased abruptly from 1.8 to 2.5% for infants and children, front 14.1 to 12.3% for adolescents and adults, while the intentional exposures increased from <1 to 21% for adolescents, and 11% for adults. Cases occurred in every decade of life but toddlers had the highest number of exposures. In 68 methanol fatalities, confusion developed followed by coma, hypotension, respiratory depression, and cerebral edema. Blood methanol levels were above 100 mg/dL (70%), metabolic acidoses (62%), and anion gaps >25 (100%). Methanol products were recorded, showing windshield wiper fluids to be 60.8% of exposures. Other automotive sources were 23.7%. Commercial nonautomotive products were 12.2% and pure methanol products were 2.3%. Unintentional exposures were reported in 90.3% of till cases, while 8.3% were due to intentional exposures, and 1.4% was for unknown or mixed reasons. Intentional exposures resulted from suspected suicides (51.2%) and from abuse and misuse (38.8%). Conclusions: Methanol poisonings continue to occur in the United States with toddlers at the highest risk for exposure, but adolescents and adults at the highest risk for life-threatening intoxications. Over half of product-identified cases were due to consumption of windshield wiper fluid. Efforts should be undertaken to minimize methanol exposures.

This is a study of quality of life (QoL), anxiety, depression, and stress in Greece following the austerity measures imposed after the crisis. A convenience sample of 901 adults completed (1) a brief survey form, (2) the Multicultural Quality of Life Index (MQLI), and (3) the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS). Results indicated higher DASS scores in comparison to other normative populations. Overall, QoL in Greece is lower for women, those who are single, the unemployed, and those with lower incomes. Implications for social work practice and the profession are discussed.

ID MENTAL-HEALTH; DISORDERS
AB Objectives: To characterize psychiatric-related emergency department visits (PREDVs) among adults in the United States for the year 2000 and to analyze PREDV trends from 1992 to 2000. Methods: Emergency department (ED) visit data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were used to estimate the number of PREDVs for adults aged 18 years and older. A PREDV was defined as any visit with a psychiatric discharge diagnosis (ICD N290-N312) or a suicide attempt (ICD E950-E959). Results: Approximately 4.3 million PREDVs occurred in the United States in the year 2000, yielding an annual rate of 21 visits per 1,000 adults. The PREDV rates increased 15% between 1992 and 2000. The PREDVs accounted for 5.4% of all ED visits. Substance abuse (27%), neuroses (26%), and psychoses (21%) were the most common conditions. African Americans had significantly higher visit rates (29/1,000; 95% CI = 27/ 1,000 to 31 / 1,000) compared with whites (23 / 1,000; 95% CI = 22 / 1,000 to 25 / 1,000). Persons with Medicaid (66 / 1,000; 95% CI = 64/1,000 to 68/1,000) had double the rate of PREDVs than the uninsured (33/1,000; 95% CI = 31/1,000 to 35/1,000) and almost eight times the rate of those privately insured (8/1,000; 95% CI = 7/1,000 to 10/1,000). Patients with psychiatric diagnoses had a higher admission rate (22%) than those with nonpsychiatric diagnoses (15%). The uninsured were the least likely to be admitted for all major psychiatric conditions except suicide (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Psychiatric-related ED visits represent a substantial and growing number of ED visits each year. Patient characteristics influence the likelihood of a PREDV. Further research is needed to better understand the role that hospital EDs play in the delivery of health care services to those with mental illness.

AB Individual differences in self-control have been shown to reflect two underlying dimensions: initiation and inhibition. We examined the possibility that degrees of self-control might likewise be modeled at a broader social level, similar to other socio-cultural differences that operate at an individual level (e.g., collectivism). To test this notion, we used a variety of mundane behaviors measured at the level of U.S. states to create inhibitory and initiatory indices of self-control at a collective level. We show that statewide levels of initiatory and inhibitory self-control, despite being correlated with one another, exhibit unique patterns of association with a wide range of outcomes, including homicide, suicide, home foreclosures, divorce, and infidelity. This study represents one of the first attempts to model the dimensional structure of self-control at a social level and supports the utility of conceptualizing self-control as an important socio-cultural variable.

AB Research has consistently demonstrated a relationship between history of forced sex and poor behavioral health outcomes. The objectives of this study were to describe this relationship among high school students and to explore the impact of resiliency factors. Using data from the 2013 New Mexico Youth Risk and Resiliency Survey, we found that history of forced sex was associated with negative behavioral health outcomes for males and females, regardless of sexual orientation and disability status. Furthermore, the presence of a caring adult at home appeared to reduce the risk of substance abuse and suicidality among students with and without a history of forced sex.

World's position: Albania, Colombia, the Netherlands, and Switzerland permit euthanasia conditionally. Australia's legalization of euthanasia has been withdrawn. The United States permits withdrawal of life support. Mexico and Norway permit active euthanasia. India's position: Following the Aruna Shanbaug case the Supreme Court granted legal sanction to passive, but not active, euthanasia that is valid till the Parliament legislates on euthanasia. Handling euthanasia requests: Acknowledging the complexity of the problem; individualizing the palliative approach; and accepting the There is no alternative' or There is no answer' (TINA) factor.

In this article, categories of underserved populations are described. Each section defines the population being presented, identifies the mental health problems each is likely to encounter, explores the barriers that prevent access to care, and identifies potential methods to minimize such barriers. The ways in which psychiatric issues vary in underserved settings compared with the general population are differentiated.

AB Background: Suicidal behavior in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been minimally explored. We aimed to determine United States (US) nationally representative prevalence estimates of suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide/self-inflicted injury (S/SII) among hospitalized adults with IBD and to examine trends in suicidal behavior over time.
   Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study using National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample data (2006-2011) identified adults with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC), SI or S/SII, and multiple comorbid risk factors for suicidal behavior.
   Results: We identified 331,777 (estimated 1.64 million) IBD-related hospitalizations (64% CD, 36% UC) and 39,787,239 (estimated 196.08 million) hospitalizations among the general US population. Among IBD-related hospitalizations, 2502 discharges were associated with SI (prevalence 0.76%) and 1104 with S/SII (prevalence 0.33%). Both were significantly greater in CD versus UC (P < 0.001). Relative to the general US population, IBD patients were significantly less likely to demonstrate suicidal behavior: (SI: 0.33% versus 0.59%, P < 0.001) (S/SII:0.75% versus 1.04%, P < 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression revealed that IBD was associated with decreased odds of SI (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.62, 95% CI 0.60-0.65) and S/SII (aOR 0.43, 95% CI 0.40-0.45) relative to the general population, and suicidal behavior was lower in IBD compared to disease-related controls with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Similar increasing trends in suicidal behavior were observed in IBD and non-IBD populations (2006-2011).
   Conclusion: In this large US database, SI or S/SII occurred in over 1% of the IBD population and was increased in CD versus UC.

ID POISONINGS
AB Pesticide mortality in the US is usual reported on a case-by-case basis. The Vital Statistics of the US and the publications of the American Association of Poison Control Centers publish yearly statistics on pesticide mortality. This review evaluates the incidence of pesticide mortality in regard to intent. geography, sex, race, age and trends from the years 1979-1998. In this fashion it appeared easier to identify likely areas of exposures and to develop steps to reduce mortality. Pesticide mortality has decreased substantial over the last 20 y. Intentional poisonings, primarily suicides, represent the greatest fraction and are decreasing more slows than accidental poisonings. Mortality is thus following intentional exposure rather than accidental exposure. Intentional exposures may occur away from sites where pesticide use is expected.

AB We show that a country's average IQ score is a useful predictor of the wages that immigrants from that country earn in the United States, whether or not one adjusts for immigrant education. Just as in numerous microeconomic studies, 1 IQ point predicts 1% higher wages, suggesting that IQ tests capture an important difference in cross-country worker productivity. In a cross-country development accounting exercise, about one-sixth of the global inequality in log income can be explained by the effect of large, persistent differences in national average IQ on the private marginal product of labor. This suggests that cognitive skills matter more for groups than for individuals. (JEL J24, J61, O47).

AB Background: This study aimed to longitudinally examine the relationship between treatment utilization and suicidal behavior among people with major depressive disorder in a nationally representative sample.
   Methods: Data came from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) (Wave 1: N=43,093; Wave 2: N=34,653). Suicidal and non-suicidal individuals at Wave 1 were compared based on subsequent treatment utilization. Suicidal behavior at Wave 2 was compared between people with major depressive disorder who had sought treatment at Wave 1 versus those that had not.
   Results: Individuals with past year major depressive disorder at Wave 1 who attempted suicide were more likely to be hospitalized at follow up compared to non-suicidal people with major depressive disorder [adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=4.46; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 2.54-7.85]; however, they were not more likely to seek other forms of treatment. Among those with past year major depressive disorder who sought treatment at baseline, visiting an emergency room (AOR=3.08; 95% CI: 1.61-5.89) and being hospitalized (AOR=2.41; 95% CI: 1.13-5.14), was associated with an increased likelihood of attempting suicide within 3 years even after adjusting for mental disorder comorbidity, depression severity, and previous suicidal behavior.
   Limitations: Unable to draw conclusions about completed suicide or adequacy of treatment.
   Conclusions: Suicidal behavior does not lead individuals with major depressive disorder to seek treatment with professionals or use antidepressant medications; instead, they are more likely to use emergency services. These findings suggest that treatment efforts for people with major depressive disorder who are suicidal need improvement. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: We determined the frequency of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) in offenders. We examined demographic characteristics, psychiatric comorbidity, and quality of life in those with and without ASPD. We also looked at the subset with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
   METHODS: A random sample of 320 newly incarcerated offenders was assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), and the Level of Service Inventory-Revised (LSI-R).
   RESULTS: ASPD was present in 113 subjects (35.3%). There was no gender-based prevalence difference. Offenders with ASPD were younger, had a higher suicide risk, and had higher rates of mood, anxiety, substance use, psychotic, somatoform disorders, borderline personality disorder, and ADHD. Quality of life was worse, and their LSI-R scores were higher, indicating a greater risk for recidivism. A subanalysis showed that offenders with ASPD who also had ADHD had a higher suicide risk, higher rates of comorbid disorders, and worse mental health functioning.
   CONCLUSION: ASPD is relatively common among both male and female inmates and is associated with comorbid disorders, high suicide risk, and impaired quality of life. Those with comorbid ADHD were more impaired than those without ADHD. ASPD occurs frequently in prison populations and is nearly as common in women as in men. These study findings should contribute to discussions of appropriate and innovative treatment of ASPD in correctional settings.

AB Background: Suicide is a leading cause of premature death among military service members/veterans (SM/Vs). The Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (Joiner, 2007) proposes that higher thwarted belonging, perceived burdensomeness, and acquired capability confer increased risk for suicide. However, no studies have examined the association of sexual dysfunction, a possible component of thwarted belonging and perceived burdensomeness, with suicidal ideation. The present study explored whether sexual dysfunction was associated with suicidal ideation when accounting for mental health, demographic, and military characteristics among female SM/Vs.
   Method: Female SM/Vs (n = 710) completed an anonymous online survey assessing demographics, mental health, military characteristics, sexual dysfunction, and suicidal ideation.
   Results: One hundred fifty-nine participants (22.39%) reported suicidal ideation during the preceding two weeks. A multivariable ordinal regression adjusted for age, marital status, probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), probable depression, race/ethnicity, Army service, and deployment history. Lower sexual functioning (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.98, 95% confidence interval[CI] = 0.95-0.99), probable PTSD (AOR = 2.54, 95% CI = 1.61-4.01), and probable depression (AOR = 5.28, 95% CI = 3.34-8.34) were associated with suicidal ideation. Post-hoc analyses examined the association of suicidal ideation with specific components of sexual functioning: difficulties with sexual arousal (AOR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.79-0.97) and sexual satisfaction (AOR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.75-0.96) were associated with suicidal ideation.
   Limitations: Data were cross-sectional and limited to self-report.
   Discussion: Sexual dysfunction is associated with suicidal ideation, accounting for established mental health, military, and demographic characteristics among female SM/Vs. Efforts to prevent suicidal ideation in female SM/Vs may be enhanced by screening for and treating sexual dysfunction, particularly sexual arousal and satisfaction.

AB OBJECTIVES: Suicide ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SAs) have been reported as increasing among US children over the last decade. We examined trends in emergency and inpatient encounters for SI and SA at US children's hospitals from 2008 to 2015.
   METHODS: We used retrospective analysis of administrative billing data from the Pediatric Health Information System database.
   RESULTS: There were 115856 SI and SA encounters during the study period. Annual percentage of all visits for SI and SA almost doubled, increasing from 0.66% in 2008 to 1.82% in 2015 (average annual increase 0.16 percentage points [95% confidence intervals (CIs) 0.15 to 0.17]). Significant increases were noted in all age groups but were higher in adolescents 15 to 17 years old (average annual increase 0.27 percentage points [95% CI 0.23 to 0.30]) and adolescents 12 to 14 years old (average annual increase 0.25 percentage points [95% CI 0.21 to 0.27]). Increases were noted in girls (average annual increase 0.14 percentage points [95% CI 0.13 to 0.15]) and boys (average annual increase 0.10 percentage points [95% CI 0.09 to 0.11]), but were higher for girls. Seasonal variation was also observed, with the lowest percentage of cases occurring during the summer and the highest during spring and fall.
   CONCLUSIONS: Encounters for SI and SA at US children's hospitals increased steadily from 2008 to 2015 and accounted for an increasing percentage of all hospital encounters. Increases were noted across all age groups, with consistent seasonal patterns that persisted over the study period. The growing impact of pediatric mental health disorders has important implications for children's hospitals and health care delivery systems.

AB The purpose of the present study was to evaluate gender differences-in a representative sample of adult Canadians-in 12-month mental health consultation among (a) the general population (n = 86,043), (b) those with major depressive disorder (n = 1,673), and (c) those with suicide ideation (n = 228). Data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), 2009-2010 (Statistics Canada, 2011a), a representative sample of Canadians, were used. Only respondents 15 years or older and who indicated that they had or had not consulted with a health professional for a mental health concern were included. Logistic regression was employed to evaluate gender differences in any mental health consultation and by specific health professional types consulted, while controlling for potentially confounding variables (e. g., demographics, psychological distress). The same analytic method was used to evaluate gender differences in number of consultations. Among all Canadians, women more frequently consulted all types of health professionals for a mental health reason. However, the magnitude of that difference varied by the concern and provider type. Overall, the greatest gender differences were among those with suicide ideation. Similarly, men had fewer consultations across mental health concerns. Findings demonstrate how gender differences in mental health consultation vary depending on the type of provider and the mental health concern. This knowledge helps identify populations of emphasis for interventions that aim to reduce stigma surrounding specific mental health concerns and consulting specific types of health professionals.

AB Background: Use of mental health services (MHS) by people with suicidal ideation is critical in prevention of suicide, and identification of the factors that influence MHS use may assist in providing efficient interventions and treatments for suicidal individuals. Thus, we investigated the association between socioeconomic factors and use of MHS in people with suicidal ideation.
   Method: We analyzed the data of the Fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2010-2012, a nationally representative cross-sectional study of the Korean population. Among the 24,173 people from the national health survey, we investigated the socioeconomic, clinical, and health-related characteristics of 2616 participants aged 19 years and older with suicidal ideation within the previous year.
   Results: In the logistic regression analyses, after adjusting for potentially confounding factors, the odds ratio (OR) for nonuse of MHS was significant in the subjects aged 65 years or older (OR=4.90), aged 50-64 years (OR=2.11), with 10-12 years of education (OR=1.87), widowed (OR=2.75), with economic activity (OR=1.60), with an employment status of paid employee (OR=1.97), without depressive mood (OR=2.73), having not attempted suicide (OR=4.04), and with no reported problems in their usual activities (OR=2.17).
   Limitations: We did not use standardized assessment tools to evaluate suicidal ideation and depressive mood.
   Conclusions: We observed a significant influence of several socioeconomic factors, depressive mood, and suicide attempts on the MHS use of adults with suicidal ideation, based on a nationally representative sample of the Korean population. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Suicide is one of the ten leading causes of death in United States and the suicide rate in the military population has increased since the start of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. However, few biomarkers for current suicidal ideation (CSI) have been identified. The current study examined the association of four candidate genes with CSI in active duty US Army Special Operations Command and National Guard units (n = 3,889) who served in Iraq and Afghanistan between November 2009 and July 2014.
   Methods: Current PTSD symptoms and CSI were assessed using the PTSD Checklist (PCL) and PHQ-9, respectively. Traumatic events were assessed using items from the Life Events Checklist (LEC) that met the DSM-IV PTSD criteria of a traumatic stressor. All genotypes of saliva DNA were discriminated using the TaqMan 5'-exonuclease assay.
   Results: The associations between CSI and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), FK506 binding protein (FKBP5), catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), or S100A10 (p11) were examined. We found CSI was associated with BDNF (OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.5-1.8, P = 0.0002), but not FKBP5, COMT and p11. Female soldiers reported CSI more often than males (chi(2) = 7.403, p = 0.0065), although gender did not affect CSI severity. In addition, associations were found between CSI and depression, PTSD, and BDNF, but not traumatic events. The BDNF Val66Met contributed to the severity of CSI even after adjusting to PTSD, depression and LEC.
   Conclusions: The associations of BDNF with CSI and its severity suggest that BDNF may be a predictor of suicidal risk and present an opportunity to develop laboratory tools with clinical implications in suicide prevention and treatment.

AB Background: Several professional medical societies advocate for firearm safety counseling with patients. Little is known about Emergency Physicians' practices and perceptions of firearm safety counseling. Objective: To assess Emergency Physicians' beliefs regarding firearm control and their confidence in counseling patients on firearm safety. Methods: A national random sample (n = 500) of the members of the American College of Emergency Physicians was sent a valid and reliable questionnaire on firearm safety counseling. Results: Of the 278 (56.8%) responding physicians, those who were non-white and those who were not members of the National Rifle Association (NRA) perceived firearm violence to be more of a problem than white physicians and those who were members of the NRA. The majority did not believe that patients would view them as a good source of information on firearm safety (63.3%) or that patients would accept them providing anticipatory firearm safety guidance (56.5%). The majority of the Emergency Department physicians did not believe firearm safety counseling would impact firearm-related homicides (75.2%) or suicides (70%). Conclusions: The vast majority of Emergency Physicians had never been formally trained regarding firearm safety counseling, did not believe patients would see them as credible sources, and did not believe that anticipatory guidance on firearm safety would have any impact. These data may help inform Emergency Medicine residency programs on the training needs of residents regarding anticipatory guidance on firearm safety. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess physician assistant training programs incorporation of firearm injury prevention training in their curricula. Also, content of such programs as well as perceived benefits and barriers of providing such training were explored.
   Methods: A three-wave postal mailing of a 24-item questionnaire was sent to the population (n = 145) of physician assistant program directors.
   Results: The majority (77%) of directors responded. The majority (81.3%) reported they had not seriously thought about providing such training (pre-contemplation). The three most important barriers to providing firearm injury prevention training were: lack of time, lack of faculty expertise on the topic, and lack of standardized teaching materials. Those programs that offered training averaged one-half hour. Yet, 77.7% thought that firearm injuries were a very large or large problem to the health and wellbeing of the U.S. population.
   Conclusion: There is a paucity of professional training for physician assistants regarding firearm injury prevention. It appears unlikely that physician assistants are playing a role in helping to reduce one of the leading causes of death in the U.S., firearm trauma. The American Academy of Physician Assistants needs to take the lead in improving training in this area for physician assistants. Practice Implications: Physician Assistant training program directors should consider offering firearm injury prevention training to help reduce patient suicides and homicides.

AB The review analyses the influence of the Internet on the risks of suicidal behavior (SB). The Internet has both positive and negative influence on people who are susceptible to suicidal behavior, SB. At the same time, if the Internet is used properly, it can also be a key resource for helping potentially suicidal individualspeople at risk of suicide do not seek help before an attempt, and do not remain connected to health services following an attempt). E-health interventions are now being considered as a means to identify at-risk individuals, offer self-help through web interventions or to deliver proactive interventions in response to individuals' posts on social media. Research studies focus on three aspects of SB and the internet: the use of online screening, the effectiveness of e-health interventions aimed to manage suicidal thoughts, and studies which aim to proactively intervene when individuals at risk of SB are identified by their social media postings. There is a need for additional robust controlled studies to establish whether suicide screening can effectively reduce SB risk, and in what settings and/or target groups online screening might be most effective. The evidence for the use of intervention practices using social media is possible, although validity, feasibility and implementation remains highly uncertain. It is unreasonable to underestimate and overestimate the risk of the Internet for vulnerable individuals, but its "harmfulness" is questionable a priori: the tool is not bad or good, unlike actions. The Internet is a component of the social environment, but does not dominate the risk factors of the joint venture. The role of the Internet in youth as the most active users of the network is twofold: provoking and useful.

AB Treatment-emergent suicidal ideation and behavior are ongoing concerns with antidepressants. Vilazodone, currently approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults, has also been evaluated in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Post-hoc analyses of vilazodone trials were carried out to examine its effects on suicidal ideation and behavior in adults with MDD or GAD. Data were pooled from vilazodone trials in MDD (four studies) and GAD (three studies). The incidence of suicide-related events was analyzed on the basis of treatment-emergent adverse event reporting and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) monitoring. Treatment-emergent suicidal ideation was analyzed on the basis of a C-SSRS category shift from no suicidal ideation/behavior (C-SSRS=0) at baseline to suicide ideation (C-SSRS=1-5) during treatment. In pooled safety populations (MDD, n=2233; GAD, n=1475), suicide-related treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in less than 1% of vilazodone-treated and placebo-treated patients. Incidences of C-SSRS suicidal ideation were as follows: MDD (vilazodone=19.9%, placebo=24.7%); GAD (vilazodone=7.7%, placebo=9.4%). Shifts from no suicidal ideation/behavior at baseline to suicidal ideation during treatment were as follows: MDD (vilazodone=9.4%, placebo=10.3%); GAD (vilazodone=4.4%, placebo=6.1%). Data from placebo-controlled studies indicate little or no risk of treatment-emergent suicidal ideation or behavior with vilazodone in adults with MDD or GAD. Nevertheless, all patients should be monitored for suicidal thoughts and behaviors during antidepressant treatment. Copyright (C) 2017 The Author (s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB Background: Suicide is a leading cause of death among 10- to 19-year-olds in the United States, with 5% to 8% attempting suicide each year. Suicide risk rises significantly during early adolescence and is higher in rural and underserved communities. School-based universal prevention programs offer a promising way of reducing suicide by providing strategies for emotion regulation and encouraging help-seeking behaviors and youth-adult connectedness. However, such programs frequently run into difficulties in trying to engage a broad range of students. Text messaging is a dominant medium of communication among youths, and studies show both efficacy and uptake in text messaging interventions aimed at adolescents. Text-based interventions may, thus, offer a means for school-based universal prevention programs to engage adolescents who would otherwise be difficult to reach.
   Objective: We field tested Text4Strength, an automated, interactive text messaging intervention that seeks to reach a broad range of early adolescents in rural communities. Text4Strength extends Sources of Strength, a peer-led school suicide prevention program, by encouraging emotion regulation, help-seeking behaviors, and youth-adult connectedness in adolescents. The study tested the appeal and feasibility of Text4Strength and its potential to extend universal school-based suicide prevention.
   Methods: We field tested Text4Strength with 42 ninth-grade students. Over 9 weeks, students received 28 interactive message sequences across 9 categories (Sources of Strength introduction, positive friend, mentors, family support, healthy activities, generosity, spirituality, medical access, and emotion regulation strategies). The message sequences included games, requests for advice, questions about students' own experiences, and peer testimonial videos. We measured baseline mental health characteristics, frequency of replies, completion of sequences and video viewing, appeal to students, and their perception of having benefited from the program.
   Results: Of the 42 participating students, 38 (91%) responded to at least one sequence and 22 (52%) responded to more than a third of the sequences. The proportion of students who completed multistep sequences they had started ranged from 35% (6/17) to 100% (3/3 to 28/28), with responses dropping off when more than 4 replies were needed. With the exception of spirituality and generosity, each of the content areas generated at least a moderate number of student replies from both boys and girls. Students with higher and lower levels of risk and distress interacted with the sequences at similar rates. Contrary to expectations, few students watched videos. Students viewed the intervention as useful-even those who rarely responded to messages. More than 70% found the texts useful (3 items, n range 29-34) and 90% (36) agreed the program should be repeated.
   Conclusions: Text4Strength offers a potentially engaging way to extend school-based interventions that promote protective factors for suicide. Text4Strength is ready to be revised, based on findings and student feedback from this field test, and rigorously tested for efficacy.

AB Placing incarcerated juveniles into solitary confinement continues to occur in certain states of the United States, despite the accumulating evidence that it may cause substantial psychological damage to the teenagers who must endure it. The practice has been widely condemned by professional and human rights organizations, amid a growing appreciation of the immaturity and vulnerability of the adolescent brain. Although several states and the federal government have been successful in abolishing or dramatically reducing the use of juvenile solitary confinement, it remains common practice in many facilities. Clinicians working in correctional facilities where juvenile solitary confinement is employed are therefore faced with difficult questions of ethics, as to how best to balance their competing duties, and how to respond to such state-sanctioned ill treatment of their patients. Given the emerging consensus around the psychological damage wrought by sustained solitary confinement, clinicians may well reach the difficult conclusion that they are both legally mandated and ethically bound to file a report of suspected child abuse. Such a report would be unlikely to be investigated for administrative reasons, but it would allow clinicians to communicate the gravity of their concern effectively.

AB Objective Low-income adults are considered to be a group at high risk for suicide. We sought to examine the effect of type D personality and other socio-demographic factors on suicidality in low-income, middle-aged Koreans.
   Methods In total, 306 low-income, middle-aged Koreans [age: 49.16 +/- 5.24 (40-59) years, 156 males, 150 females] were enrolled from the Korean National Basic Livelihood Security System. Socio-demographic data, including employment status, income, health, marital status, and educational attainment, were gathered. Beck's 19-item Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI) was applied to evaluate suicidality, and the DS14 was used to assess type D personality
   Results Unemployment (p<0.01) and absence of spouse (p=0.03) predicted higher SSI scores independent of other socioeconomic factors. All type D personality scores [i.e., negative affectivity (NA), social inhibition (SI), and total score] predicted higher SSI scores independent of all socioeconomic factors (all, p<0.001). Subjects with type D personality had higher SSI scores (p<0.001), and the association between suicidality and socio-demographic factors (employment or physical health) could be found only in subjects without type D personality.
   Conclusion Type D personality was a risk factor for suicide in low-income Koreans, independently from socio-economic factors. In addition, the socio-demographic factors were less prominently associated with suicidality in those with type D personality.

AB Background ge of onset of major depression seems to be dropping in Western nations. Early onset usually predicts a more serious illness with a relatively poor prognosis. Since depression is associated with suicide, this begs the question of whether early onset of depression is associated with the degree of intent of suicidal behaviour, and whether this relationship differs according to gender. Methods elevant responses from 9,282 residents of the United States were drawn from a nationally representative community survey conducted in 2001 through 2003 using the W.H.O. version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The primary outcome measure was the retrospectively determined age of first major depressive episode. Results Younger age of onset for depression was associated with higher levels of suicidal intent, irrespective of age at the time of interview. A significant interaction between level of intent and age at interview appeared to be accounted for by the later onset among those in the eldest cohort who reported an absence of suicidal behaviour. The influence of suicidal intent on onset of depression was greater for women than for men. Conclusions The earlier the age of first symptoms of major depressive episode, the higher the degree of suicidal intent, irrespective of age at interview and gender, although the more pronounced trend for women suggests a greater sensitivity to underlying factors that may involve depression and lead to suicide risk.

AB Homosexuality has been shown to be associated with suicidality and mental disorders. It is unclear whether homosexuality is related to suicidality, independently of mental disorders. This study assessed differences in lifetime symptoms of suicidality (death ideation, death wishes, suicide contemplation, and deliberate self-harm) between homosexual and heterosexual men and women, controlling for lifetime psychiatric morbidity. Interaction effects of age and the role of perceived discrimination were also examined. Data were collected on a representative sample of the Dutch population aged 18-64 years. Classification as heterosexual or homosexual was based upon reported sexual behavior in the preceding year. Of those sexually active, 2.8% of 2,878 men and 1.4% of 3,120 women had had same-sex partners. Homosexual men differed from their heterosexual counterparts on all four suicide symptoms (OR ranging from 2.58 to 10.23, with higher ORs for more severe symptoms), and on the sum total of the four symptoms; homosexual women only differed from heterosexual women on suicide contemplation (OR=2.12). Controlling for psychiatric morbidity decreased the ORs, but among men all associations were still significant; the significance for suicide contemplation among women disappeared. Younger homosexuals were not at lower risk for suicidality than older homosexuals in comparison with their heterosexual counterparts. Among homosexual men, perceived discrimination was associated with suicidality. This study suggests that even in a country with a comparatively tolerant climate regarding homosexuality, homosexual men were at much higher risk for suicidality than heterosexual men. This relationship could not only be attributed to their higher psychiatric morbidity. In women, there was no such clear relationship.

TI Hydrogen Sulfide Suicide: A New Trend and Threat to Healthcare Providers
SO JOURNAL OF BURN CARE & RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB First popularized in Japan, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas suicide is an underreported form of suicide with known risk for secondary disaster. Mortality rate commonly exceeds 90% because of the gas's lethal, noncontained nature. Instances in the United States are increasing, up from 2 cases in 2008 to 18 in 2010. Because H2S poisonings remain rare, there exists a lack of knowledge regarding the residual effects of gas venting after victim extrication. Identifying instances of the efficacious use of personal protection equipment (PPE) is critical in the effort to alleviate risks faced by hospital and rescue personnel. The current case demonstrates the effective use of PPEs after prolonged H2S exposure. In 2011, a 20-year-old man threatened suicide using H2S gas inside a vehicle on a remote rural highway. First responders identified a rotten egg smell and subsequently experienced low poisoning symptoms. After prolonged Hazmat-assisted extrication (4 hours) the patient was unconscious and experiencing seizures. He was decontaminated on-scene (20 minutes) and transported to the closest hospital (22 minutes). Ambulance personnel who wore PPE and used the ambulance's reverse ventilation system (RVS)reported no adverse effects. The patient was transferred to the authors' burn facility by helicopter (38 minutes). Life-flight personnel, who did not wear PPE (no ventilatory system available), complained of watery eyes, headache, and dizziness. Hospital personnel, who did not use PPE (or RVS), complained of watery eyes or headache. Exposed personnel demonstrated no deficits or residual effects. In spite of spontaneous movement, the patient began to seize and died. This case is unique given the multiple primary and secondary H2S gas exposures involved. Exposed personnel without RVS and not using PPE demonstrated moderate H2S symptoms. PPE (self-contained breathing apparatuses) and RVS were shown to be effective during an H2S emergency; however, there are currently limited data supporting their appropriate use. Until data demonstrating duration of H2S venting for small enclosed spaces are made available, PPEs should be required.

AB Background: Detailed characteristics of depressive smokers and its association with suicidality were still less investigated. The aim of this study was to delineate characteristics of smokers with major depressive disorder (MDD) and examine the relationship between these characteristics and suicidality using an epidemiologic database, the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC).
   Methods: A total of 5695 subjects with MDD, defined by the DSM-IV criteria, were included in our analysis. Current smokers, former smokers, and lifetime nonsmokers were compared in terms of demographic, clinical characteristics, and functional level. Suicidality, evaluated by history of suicide ideation and attempts while in a low mood was evaluated and compared among the groups.
   Results: Current smokers with MDD showed a greater number of DSM-IV symptoms while in acute episodes, a higher rate of alcohol and drug-use disorders, and poorer functional levels than nonsmokers. Previous smokers displayed intermediate characteristics between current smokers and nonsmokers. The logistic regression analysis revealed that both current and former smoking status predicted the risk of having a history of attempted suicide (current smokers: odds ratio 1.62, 95% Cl, 1.42-1.86; former smokers: odds ratio 1.37, 95% Cl. 1.13-1.66) after adjusting for demographic data, a history of subthreshold hypomania, and a lifetime axis II/anxiety/alcohol use/substance-use disorder.
   Limitations: Retrospective, cross-sectional evaluation; suicidality assessed only in the most severe depressive episode.
   Conclusions: The present study corroborates that smokers with MDD showed distinct clinical characteristics, and cigarette smoking can predict attempted suicide in a community representative sample of people with MDD. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved

AB Objective: The aim of the study was to define the extent of current and lifetime smoking by diagnostic groups and suicide risk as reason for admission in a geographically defined psychiatric inpatient cohort.
   Design: The study used a population-based retrospective chart review.
   Methods: Smoking status and discharge diagnoses for Olmsted County, Minnesota, inpatients aged 18 to 65 admitted for psychiatric hospitalization in 2004 and 2005 were abstracted from the electronic medical record. Diagnostic groups were compared to each other using chi(2) tests and Fisher exact test to analyze smoking status within the inpatient sample with significance defined as P <= .05.
   Results: Eighty percent (80.41) of our sample of 776 patients was hospitalized due to acute suicide risk. Discharge diagnostic group composition included affective disorders (80.3%), substance abuse disorders (36.1%), anxiety disorders (19%), psychotic disorders (16.4%), and personality disorders (10.3%). Of the sample, 72.2% had at least one comorbid disorder. Of the 776 patients, 356 (45.9%) were current smokers. Substance abuse and psychotic disorder diagnoses were significantly correlated with current smoking status (<.0001, .02) with 77.1% and 55.9%, respectively, being current snickers compared to other psychiatric inpatient groups. All diagnostic groups smoked at higher rates and had less success stopping than the US general population.
   Conclusion: Our findings clearly demonstrate stratification of current smoking and quit rates in psychiatric inpatient diagnostic groups vs the US general population and Minnesota. Further research into the association between suicide risk, smoking, and mortality in the seriously mentally ill is necessary. Recognizing and addressing smoking in psychiatric patients in both hospital and outpatient settings is critical to addressing survival differences compared to the general population.

AB Purpose: To examine mental health indicators, in aggregate and stratified by sex, among a population based sample of U.S. military veterans.
   Methods: Data are from veteran who completed the Veterans Health Module (VHM) of the 2011 and 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (n = 10,406). VHM items included lifetime diagnoses of mental illnesses, service in a combat zone, sources of mental health care, and past 12-month suicidal ideation and attempt. We used weighted, multiple logistic regression models, adjusted for sociodemographics, to examine differences in suicidal ideation and attempt among men and women.
   Results: Overall, 5.0% of the sample reported recent suicidal ideation and 1.0% reported attempting suicide. Among men, unemployment was positively associated with suicidal ideation, and combat exposure was negatively associated with suicidal ideation. Being separated, divorced, or widowed was positively associated with suicidal ideation among women. After adjusting for sociodemographic and VHM variables, veterans who sought mental health treatment from both Veterans Affairs (VA) and non-VA facilities had more than fourfold increased odds of suicidal ideation than veteran who sought mental health treatment from only VA facilities (adjusted odds ratio = 4.02; 95% confidence interval 1.23-13.13).
   Conclusions: Correlates of suicidal ideation differ between male and female veterans. Veterans who use both non-VA and VA facilities for mental health services may have greater risk of self-directed violence. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Wellbeing (positive mental health) and mental ill-health of veterinary students from a single UK school were quantified using validated psychological scales. Attitudes towards mental ill-health and suicide were also assessed. Results were compared with published data from the UK general population and veterinary profession. Of the total student population (N=1068), 509 (48 per cent) completed a questionnaire. Just over half (54 per cent) of the respondents had ever experienced mental ill-health, with the majority reporting a first occurrence before veterinary school. Student wellbeing was significantly poorer (p<0.0001) than general population estimates, but not significantly different (p=0.2) from veterinary profession estimates. Degree of mental distress in students was significantly higher than in the general population (p<0.0001). Despite the majority (94 per cent) agreeing that 'Anyone can suffer from mental health problems', students were significantly more likely than members of the general population to agree that 'If I were suffering from mental health problems, I wouldn't want people knowing about it' (p<0.0001). Students were more likely to have thought about suicide, but less likely to have made an attempt (p<0.001; p=0.005), than members of the general population. The possibility of non-response bias must be considered when interpreting findings. However, strong similarities between results from this study population and the UK veterinary profession, as well as other veterinary student populations internationally, suggest no substantial school-level bias.

AB The object of this study was to investigate the attitudes of physicians, nurses and the general public to physician-assisted suicide (PAS), active voluntary euthanasia (AVE) and passive euthanasia (PE) in Finland.
   Respondents received a postal questionnaire to evaluate the acceptability of euthanasia in five scenarios, which were imaginary patient cases. Age, severity of pain and prognosis of the disease were presented as background factors in these scenarios.
   This work was carried out in Finland in 1998.
   The respondents include a random selection of 814 physicians (506 responded, 62%), 800 nurses (582 responded, 68%) and 1000 representatives of the general public (587 responded, 59%).
   Thirty-four percent of the physicians, 46% of the nurses and 50% of the general public agreed that euthanasia would be acceptable in some situations. Of the scenarios, PE was most often considered acceptable in cases of severe dementia (physicians 88%, nurses 79% and general public 64%). In the same scenario, 8% of physicians, 23% of nurses and 48% of general public accepted AVE. In the scenario of an incurable cancer, 20% of the physicians, 34% of the nurses and 42% of the general public accepted PAS. All forms of euthanasia were generally more acceptable in older, than in younger, scenario patients.
   This paper conclude that PE was largely accepted among Finnish medical professionals and the general public. Only a minority favored AVE and PAS.

AB ObjectivesTo describe suicide-related exposures in older persons according to sex, age, and substance category reported to U.S. poison control centers (PCCs) and report the crude relative risk (RR) of major effects and death from pharmaceuticals and nonpharmaceutical substances after single- and multiple-substance exposures.
   DesignCross-sectional analysis of American Association of Poison Control Centers National Poison Data System (NPDS) data.
   SettingCalls to U.S. PCCs.
   ParticipantsNPDS cases involving individuals aged 60 and older with an exposure to a pharmaceutical or nonpharmaceutical substance and suicide as the reason (n=46,494).
   MeasurementsMajor effect and death probabilities for single- and multiple-substance exposures to pharmaceuticals and nonpharmaceuticals were determined. In the NPDS, a major effect is defined as symptoms or signs that are life-threatening or resulted in significant residual disability or disfigurement. Crude RRs of major effects or death were estimated for single and multiple pharmaceutical substances in comparison with nonpharmaceutical substances.
   ResultsSingle-substance exposures occurred in 53.3% of cases. Overall, 92.3% involved pharmaceuticals and 64.4% involved women. In the total sample, 12.7% (5,895/46,494) of exposures resulted in major effect, and 1.9% (884/46,494) resulted in death. The crude RR of major effects in single-substance pharmaceutical exposures was significantly lower than with nonpharmaceutical exposures (RR=0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.49-0.59), as was death (RR=0.25, 95% CI=0.20-0.30). For multiple-substance exposures, the crude RR of major effects from pharmaceuticals was similar to that for nonpharmaceuticals (RR=0.92, 95% CI=0.80-1.06), whereas the crude RR of death from pharmaceuticals was significantly lower (RR=0.55, 95% CI=0.40-0.77).
   ConclusionThese findings can inform suicide prevention strategies that focus on decreasing at-risk older adults' access to dangerous medications and chemicals in the home.

AB Objective: Relative suicidal behavioral risks (ideation, attempts) for overweight, obese, and extremely obese adolescents (vs. healthy weight) and who did/did not accurately perceive themselves as overweight were examined in this study.
   Design and Methods: A new variable (weight status/accuracy) was computed that combined actual weight status (based on BMI) with weight perception accuracy. To evaluate the effect of weight status/accuracy on each suicidal risk behavior, logistic regression was performed to calculate odds-ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Potential model covariates included gender, age, race, survey year, and whether they had felt sad/hopeless.
   Results: Weight perception accuracy increased as the degree of excess weight increased. Relative to healthy weight, being obese or extremely obese (but not overweight) was associated with significantly greater risk for adolescent engagement in suicidal ideation, but was unrelated to suicide attempts. Adolescents in all excess weight categories who were accurate in their weight perception were at significantly greater odds of suicidal ideation, whereas those who were inaccurate were of no greater odds of suicidal ideation than healthy weight youth who accurately perceived their weight. Findings regarding suicide attempts varied based on actual weight/weight perception accuracy and race/ethnicity.
   Conclusion: The present findings are both important and clinically relevant. While widely accepted that there are multiple pathways to suicide, our understanding of adolescent suicidal behavior risks and accordingly, prevention efforts, will be informed by comprehensive prospective studies that should also, from here forward, consider categorization of the entire weight spectrum (e. g., extreme obesity).

AB OBJECTIVE: Suicidal youths are rarely identified in primary care settings. We describe here a care process that includes a computerized screen, colocated social workers, and a coordinated suicide-prevention team at a specialty mental health unit.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were 1547 youths aged 11 to 20 years seen in an urban primary care system during 2005 and 2006. We performed an observational study of services provided to youths who screened positive for suicidal ideation on a computerized behavioral health screen during visits to pediatric primary care clinics. Data included clinical records, provider notes, and patients' responses to the screen.
   RESULTS: A total of 209 (14%) youths reported suicidal thought in the previous month. Suicidal thought was more common among girls, younger youths, substance users, depressed youths, youths who carried weapons, and those who had been in fights; 87% reported at least 1 other serious behavioral health problem. Social workers were able to triage 205 (98%) youths. Triage occurred on the visit day for 193 youths (94%). Mental health evaluations were recommended for 152 (74%) of the triaged youths. Of the 109 subjects referred to a clinic with records accessible for review, 71 (65%) received a mental health service within 6 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric primary care is a feasible setting in which to screen for suicidal youths and link them with mental health services. Youths who visit primary care clinics are willing to disclose suicidal ideation on a computerized screen. Youths who screen positive for suicide have many associated behavioral health needs. The use of information technology, colocated physician extenders, and a coordinated team on the mental health side can facilitate rapid, personal contact between the family and mental health service providers, and has the potential to overcome barriers to care for youths with suicidal ideation in the primary care setting.

AB Relatively little is known about how parents influence the health and well-being of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adolescents and young adults. This gap has led to a paucity of parent-based interventions for LGB young people. A systematic literature review on parental influences on the health of LGB youth was conducted to better understand how to develop a focused program of applied public health research. Five specific areas of health among LGB young people aged 10-24 years old were examined: (a) sexual behavior; (b) substance use; (c) violence and victimization; (d) mental health; and (e) suicide. A total of 31 quantitative articles were reviewed, the majority of which were cross-sectional and relied on convenience samples. Results indicated a trend to focus on negative, and not positive, parental influences. Other gaps included a dearth of research on sexual behavior, substance use, and violence/victimization; limited research on ethnic minority youth and on parental influences identified as important in the broader prevention science literature; and no studies reporting parent perspectives. The review highlights the need for future research on how parents can be supported to promote the health of LGB youth. Recommendations for strengthening the research base are provided.

AB Introduction: Perinatal suicidality (i.e., thoughts of death, suicide attempts, or self-harm during the period immediately before and up to 12 months after the birth of a child) is a significant public health concern. Few investigations have examined the patients' own views and experiences of maternal suicidal ideation. Methods: Between April and October 2010, researchers identified 14 patient participants at a single university-based medical center for a follow-up, semi-structured interview if they screened positive for suicidal ideation on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) short form. In-depth interviews followed a semi-structured interview guide. Researchers transcribed all interviews verbatim and analyzed transcripts using thematic network analysis. Results: Participants described the experience of suicidality during pregnancy as related to somatic symptoms, past diagnoses, infanticide, family psychiatric history (e.g., completed suicides and family member attempts), and pregnancy complications. The network of themes included the perinatal experience, patient descriptions of changes in mood symptoms, illustrations of situational coping, and reported mental health service use. Implications: The interview themes suggested that in this small sample, pregnancy represented a critical time period to screen for suicide and to establish treatment for the mothers in the study. These findings may assist health care professionals in the development of interventions designed to identify, assess, and prevent suicidality among perinatal women.

AB Description: In May 2019, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) approved an update to the 2013 joint clinical practice guideline for assessing and managing patients who are at risk for suicide. This guideline provides health care providers with a framework by which to screen for, evaluate, treat, and manage the individual needs and preferences of VA and DoD patients who may be at risk for suicide.
   Methods: In January 2018, the VA/DoD Evidence-Based Practice Work Group convened to develop a joint VA/DoD guideline including clinical stakeholders and conforming to the National Academy of Medicine's tenets for trustworthy clinical practice guidelines. The guideline panel drafted key questions, systematically searched and evaluated the literature through April 2018, created algorithms, and advanced 22 recommendations in accordance with the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system.
   Recommendations: This synopsis, which includes 3 clinical practice algorithms, summarizes the key recommendations of the guideline related to screening and evaluation, risk management and treatment, and other management methods. Risk management and treatment recommendations address both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches for patients with suicidal ideation and behavior. Other management methods address lethal means safety (such as restricting access to firearms, poisons, and medications and installing barriers to prevent jumping from lethal heights) and population health strategies.

AB Objectives: Injury has been described as 'the last major plague of the young'. We provide an epidemiological description of injury, as a leading cause of death in New Zealand, and identify options for prevention.
   Methods: We identified all deaths due to any cause for the period 1986-95 from the national data and calculated the potential years of life lost for each death. For the same period, we identified all injury deaths for children aged 0-14 years. Causes of injury were examined in four age groups.
   Results: In the population as a whole, injury was the fourth leading cause of death and the leading cause of potential years of life lost. Injury killed children at the rate of 16.8 per 100 000 person-years. The victims were predominantly male (62%) and 52% were under 5 years of age. In infancy (< 1 year of age), suffocation was the leading cause of injury mortality. From 1 to 14 years of age, motor vehicle traffic incidents were the leading cause of mortality.
   Conclusions: Motor vehicle traffic incidents, drowning, suffocation and suicide stood out as areas with the greatest potential for reducing child injury mortality. A number of existing prevention strategies show promise (e.g. child restraints), others are inadequately implemented (e.g. swimming pool fencing) or are of unknown efficacy (e.g. government suicide prevention policies). Strategies to reduce infant suffocation and child non-traffic pedestrian deaths remain to be developed and tested.

ID UNITED-STATES; SUICIDE; HOMICIDE; INJURIES; URBANIZATION; LEVEL; RISK
AB OBJECTIVE: We examined whether firearm mortality rates among children varied across US counties along a rural-urban continuum.
   METHODS: US vital statistics data were accessed for all pediatric (age: 0-19 years) firearm deaths from 1999 through 2006. Deaths were analyzed according to a modified rural-urban continuum code (based on population size and proximity to metropolitan areas) assigned to each county (3141 counties).
   RESULTS: In the 8-year study period, there were 23 649 pediatric firearm deaths (15 190 homicides, 7082 suicides, and 1377 unintentional deaths). Pediatric nonfirearm mortality rates were significantly higher in the most-rural counties (adjusted rate ratio: 1.36 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-1.64]), compared with the most-urban counties. The most-rural counties demonstrated virtually identical pediatric firearm mortality rates (adjusted rate ratio: 0.91 [95% CI: 0.63-1.32]), compared with the most-urban counties. The most-rural counties had higher rates of pediatric firearm suicide (adjusted rate ratio: 2.01 [95% CI: 1.43-2.83]) and unintentional firearm death (adjusted rate ratio: 2.19 [95% CI: 1.27-3.77]), compared with the most-urban counties. Pediatric firearm homicides rates were significantly higher in the mosturban counties (adjusted rate ratio: 3.69 [95% CI: 2.00-6.80]), compared with the most-rural counties.
   CONCLUSIONS: Children in the most-rural US counties had firearm mortality rates that were statistically indistinguishable from those for children in the most-urban counties. This finding reflects a greater homicide rate in urban counties counterbalanced by greater suicide and unintentional firearm death rates in rural counties. Nonfirearm mortality rates were significantly greater outside the most-urban US counties. Pediatrics 2010; 125: 1112-1118

SO OMEGA-JOURNAL OF DEATH AND DYING

ID ASSISTED SUICIDE; MECHANICAL VENTILATION; WITHDRAWAL; PARALYSIS; END
AB A common dilemma among physicians who treat the dying is whether pharmacological paralysis should be reversed prior to removal of mechanical ventilation. But what if a physician were to administer a neuromuscular blocker without ever ventilating the patient in the first place? While there is evidence that euthanasia does occur in the United States, few physicians have been prosecuted. Could these infrequent prosecutions reflect a conscious desire by prosecutors not to pursue such matters? In an effort to explore this question, chief prosecutors in four U.S. states were presented with a vignette based on an actual event involving the administration of Succinylcholine to a dying patient. Response rates in this study were very acceptable (76.36% overall), and results indicated that not only was the likelihood of criminal prosecution low, almost half of the prosecutors believed that a physician-administered lethal injection may be morally justified in some circumstances even though illegal.

   IDEATION; RATES
AB Purpose: Few studies have investigated the association between religiosity and self-injurious thoughts and behaviors specifically in adolescents, yielding inconsistent results. To date, no study has examined this relationship in a Jewish adolescent cohort.
   Methods: Self-injurious thoughts and behaviors, as well as depression, were assessed in a nationally representative sample of Jewish adolescents (n = 620) and their mothers, using the Development and Well-Being Assessment Inventory (DAWBA) structured interview. Degree of religiosity was obtained by a self-report measure.
   Results: Using multivariate analysis, level of religiosity was inversely associated with self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (Wald chi(2) = 3.95, P = 0.047), decreasing the likelihood of occurrence by 55% (OR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.2-0.99), after adjusting for depression and socio-demographic factors. This model (adjusted R-2 = 0.164; likelihood ratio chi(2) = 7.59; df = 1; P < 0.047) was able to correctly classify 95.6% of the patients as belonging either to the high or low risk groups.
   Conclusion: This is the first study demonstrating religiosity to have a direct independent protective effect against self-injurious thoughts and behaviors in Jewish adolescents. This finding has clinical implications regarding risk assessment and suicide prevention. Further research can potentially elucidate the complex relationship between religiosity, self-injury and suicide in this population. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

ID UNITED-STATES; DEATHS; TOXICITY; DRUGS
AB Purpose: The presented case deals with an unusual suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning. In a car parked in a highway rest area, the body of a middle-aged man was found. In the open trunk of the car there was a gas-powered generator which was switched on, but no longer running. The tank was three quarters full. At autopsy, bright-red livores, cherry-pink fingernails, cherry-red blood and salmon-red skeletal musculature were found. According to the toxicological analysis performed during autopsy, the COHb content in the corpse blood was 68%.
   Methods: To reconstruct the event, the emergency generator was started again in the man's car. By means of measuring probes placed in the interior of the car, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and oxygen were measured and recorded in a concentration-time curve; the concentration of cyanide was measured at the end of the experiment.
   Results: The lower explosion limit of 500 ppm CO was reached after 30 s already. For technical reasons, no further values could be recorded. After about 14 min the engine started stuttering with approximately 14 vol.% of oxygen in the air, but continued to run at a lower speed until the experiment was stopped after 25 min. The final concentration of cyanide was 7.5 ppm.
   Conclusion: In view of the rapid CO increase in the interior of the vehicle it is to be assumed that the victim lost consciousness very fast. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In 2014, the USA spent $3 trillion dollars in health care the most per capita in the world. However, the USA lacks universal health coverage, and lags behind other highly developed and wealthy countries in life expectancy (even some "non wealthy" countries have better outcomes). The USA also has deficits in other health outcome measures. Health care costs in the USA continue to rise annually and many patients receive only mediocre care. In addition, clear disparities exist across different communities, socioeconomic groups, and race and ethnicity groups. As a result, individuals with mental illness are at an increased risk of being homeless, committing suicide, and having problems maintaining a job. This paper will address mental health disparities and review the efforts some states are taking to improve the lifesaving services offered to citizens with mental illness, in order for them to recover and reach their full potentials.

AB Almost all studies examining the effects of altitude on human health have estimated the geographical altitude of defined regions, yet the primary interest lies in where people live, not the land around them. Populations are not homogenously distributed across altitudes. We propose a straightforward and computationally simple method for estimating the average altitude of habitation within the regional units for which health statistics are typically reported ( uch as counties). The United States Board on Geographical Names database contains records for over 2.7 million places, which can be processed to select places that are associated with human habitation. These points can easily be averaged by region yielding a representative altitude of human habitation within city, county, state regions, or by longitude and latitude zones. We provide an example of using this approach in a study of human health, and compare it with three other previously used methods of estimating altitude for counties.

AB The purpose of this article was to examine the association between health risk behaviors (tobacco, alcohol, and drug use) and psychosocial distress indicators among high school students. The sample consisted of 4,210 adolescent students from public schools in Pernambuco State, Brazil. The Global School-based Student Health Survey was used to collect personal (demographic and socioeconomic) and behavioral data and to obtain measures of psychosocial distress indicators (outcome variables). Prevalence rates were observed for sadness, loneliness, suicidal ideation, sleeplessness due to worries, and suicidal planning. Self-reported prevalence rates for tobacco, alcohol, and drug use were 7.7%, 30.3%, and 6.9%. Psychosocial distress was more prevalent among girls, while health risk behaviors were more common among boys. The study concludes that drug use is directly associated with suicidal ideation and planning, and that among girls, alcohol consumption was associated with psychosocial distress.

AB INTRODUCTION Several studies have measured health outcomes in the United States, but none have provided a comprehensive assessment of patterns of health by state.
   OBJECTIVE To use the results of the Global Burden of Disease Study (6 BD) to report trends in the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors at the state level from 1990 to 2016.
   DESIGN AND SETTING A systematic analysis of published studies and available data sources estimates the burden of disease by age, sex, geography, and year.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalence, incidence, mortality, life expectancy, healthy life expectancy (HALE), years of life lost (YLLs) due to premature mortality, years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 333 causes and 84 risk factors with 95% uncertainty intervals (Uls) were computed.
   RESULTS Between 1990 and 2016, overall death rates in the United States declined from 745.2 (95% UI, 740.6 to 749.8) per 100 000 persons to 578.0 (95% UI, 569.4 to 587.1) per 100 000 persons. The probability of death among adults aged 20 to 55 years declined in 31 states and Washington, DC from 1990 to 2016. In 2016, Hawaii had the highest life expectancy at birth (81.3 years) and Mississippi had the lowest (74.7 years), a 6.6-year difference. Minnesota had the highest HALE at birth (70.3 years), and West Virginia had the lowest (63.8 years), a 6.5-year difference. The leading causes of DALYs in the United States for 1990 and 2016 were ischemic heart disease and lung cancer, while the third leading cause in 1990 was low back pain, and the third leading cause in 2016 was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Opioid use disorders moved from the 11th leading cause of DALYs in 1990 to the 7th leading cause in 2016, representing a 74.5% (95% UI, 42.8% to 93.9%) change. In 2016, each of the following 6 risks individually accounted for more than 5% of risk-attributable DALYs: tobacco consumption, high body mass index (BMI), poor diet, alcohol and drug use, high fasting plasma glucose, and high blood pressure. Across all US states, the top risk factors in terms of attributable DALYs were due to 1 of the 3 following causes: tobacco consumption (32 states), high BMI (10 states), or alcohol and drug use (8 states).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE There are wide differences in the burden of disease at the state level. Specific diseases and risk factors, such as drug use disorders, high BMI, poor diet, high fasting plasma glucose level, and alcohol use disorders are increasing and warrant increased attention. These data can be used to inform national health priorities for research, clinical care, and policy.

AB Background
   Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are prescribed by general practitioners (GPs) for adolescents. GPs' prescribing patterns for SSRIs changed following warnings issued by United Kingdom and United States drug advisory bodies on the use of antidepressants in children and adolescents in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Recent studies shed further light on the safety profile of SSRIs with adolescents.
   Objective
   To provide a narrative review of the physical and psychiatric side effects of SSRIs as reported by adolescents. To provide GPs with practical advice regarding the prevalence and nature of side effects of SSRIs when prescribed for adolescents.
   Discussion
   The research literature Suggests that adolescents taking SSRIs are at a small, but increased, risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours. The prescribing GP needs to be aware of a number of potential side effects and interactions. Monitoring for common physical side effects and possible emerging suicidal ideas and behaviours, especially early in treatment, is recommended.

AB Background The objectives of this study were to evaluate racial misclassification in a statewide trauma registry and to describe the epidemiology of trauma among the Washington American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) population.
   Methods We performed probabilistic record linkage between the Washington Trauma Registry (2005-2009) and Northwest Tribal Registry, a dataset of known AI/AN. AI/AN patients were compared with caucasians on demographic, injury and clinical outcome factors. A multivariable model estimated odds of mortality.
   Results Record linkage increased ascertainment of AI/AN cases in the trauma registry 71%, from 1777 to 3039 cases. Compared with caucasians, AI/AN trauma patients were younger (mean age=36 vs 47 years, p<0.001) and more commonly male (66.5% vs 61.2%, p<0.001). AI/AN experienced more intentional injuries (suicide or homicide: 20.1% vs 6.7%, p<0.001), a higher proportion of severe traumatic brain injury (20.7% vs 16.8%, p=0.004) and were less likely than caucasians to use safety equipment such as seat belts/airbags (53.9% vs 76.7%, p<0.001). ISSs were similar (ISS > 15: 21.4% vs 20.5%, p=0.63), and no difference was observed in mortality after adjustment for covariates (p=0.58).
   Conclusions Linkage to a state trauma registry improved data quality by correcting racial misclassification, allowing for a comprehensive description of injury patterns for the AI/AN population. AI/AN sustained more severe injuries with similar postinjury outcomes to caucasians. Future efforts should focus on primary prevention for this population, including increased use of seat belts and child safety seats and reduction of interpersonal violence and suicide.

AB ObjectivesA high incidence of Axis II personality disorders is described in patients with bipolar disorder; however, their relationship to mood state remains uncertain.
   MethodsA total of 966 outpatients with bipolar disorder gave informed consent and filled out the Personality Disorder Questionnaire, 4th edition (PDQ4) and a questionnaire on demographics and course of illness prior to Bipolar Treatment Outcome Network entry at average age 41 years. Patients were rated at each visit for depression on the Inventory of Depressive Symptoms-Clinician version (IDS-C) and for mania on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). In a subgroup, the PDQ4 was retaken during periods of depression and euthymia.
   ResultsPatients met criteria for most personality disorders at a much higher rate when they took the PDQ4 while depressed compared to while euthymic, and scores were significantly related to the severity of depression (IDS) and of mania (YMRS) assessed within 2 weeks of taking the PDQ. Even when euthymic, more than quarter to half of the patients met criteria for a cluster A, B or C personality disorder.
   ConclusionsA wide range of personality disorders occur in bipolar patients, but are highly dependent on filling out the form while depressed compared to while euthymic. How this relates to having a personality disorder assessed using a structured clinical interview remains to be tested. However, higher PDQ4 scores are related to an earlier age of onset of bipolar disorder and other factors portending a more difficult course of bipolar disorder, and the optimal treatment of these patients remains to be illuminated.

TI Isotretinoin use and subsequent depression and suicide - Presenting the

DT Review
ID DRUG-INDUCED DEPRESSION; PSYCHOTIC SYMPTOMS; UNITED-STATES; VITAMIN-A;
   ACNE; THERAPY; INTOXICATION; MANAGEMENT; DISABILITY; DISORDERS
AB The growing number of reported cases of depression and suicide associated with isotretinoin (a retinoid receptor agonist) use in patients with acne has prompted concern among dermatologists, patients, and their relatives and has triggered new warnings from regulators including depression-related, patient-informed consent forms. In establishing a cause-effect relationship, it is useful to judiciously consider whether there is an association, what is the nature of that association, if there is a plausible biological mechanism of action, the validity and reliability of measures used and the strength of study designs. Hoffmann-La Roche estimates that by April 2001 approximately 12 million patients worldwide have used isotretinoin, with 5 million patients in the us.
   A MEDLINE search between January 1966 and May 14 2003 of the published medical literature found 24 documented cases of isotretinoin-associated depression, with 3 suicides. One additional patient committed suicide during the fourth month of isotretinoin treatment and 3 further patients attempted suicide by taking an overdose of isotretinoin. The US FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) contains almost 23 000 reports for isotretinoin from its approval in 1982 to December 2002. As of November 30, 2002, AERS contained 3104 reports (US and foreign) with at least one reported psychiatric event. The FDA is aware of 173 reports of suicide (both US and foreign) in association with isotretinoin. Reports of positive dechallenge and rechallenge present a strong signal pointing to an association between isotretinoin and depression. A Hoffmann-La Roche sponsored epidemiological study failed to find any evidence of an association between isotretinoin and depression or suicide. However, the design of the study was flawed and the evidence was deemed inconclusive. Further studies using strong study designs, reliable and valid measures, and adequate sample sizes may bring us closer to the answer.
   The evidence suggesting a relationship between isotretinoin and depression needs to be weighed against the increasing prevalence of depression among adolescents and young adults and the psychological impact of acne. The literature contains credible evidence that isotretinoin treatment may reduce the psychosocial impact of acne in some patients. At the present time, there is no known pharmacological mechanism that would account for psychiatric symptomatology as a result of isotretinoin treatment; however, retinoid receptors are widely distributed in the brain and more research is needed to ascertain whether they have a role in depression.
   In the meantime, for the practitioner, the obvious benefit of isotretinoin in treating acne should encourage continued use. However, patients and their relatives must be informed and depressive symptoms should be actively assessed at each visit and, if necessary, referral to a psychiatrist, antidepressant therapy or discontinuation of isotretinoin should be considered.

AB Background: The USA has seen dramatic increases in drug poisoning deaths (DPD) recently. State-level rates have responded to federal and state initiatives, yet the counties with the highest rates are stable. Spatial analysis enables investigators to identify the highest risk counties and most important risk factors, although results are often confounded by spatial autocorrelation and multicollinearity.
   Methods: Profile regression (PR) is an integrated method for cluster and regression analysis, which adjusts for spatial-autocorrelation and multi-collinearity.
   Results: With PR, three clusters were identified in the Western USA with most of NM, NV and UT and several counties in AZ, CO, ID and WY being high-risk. Cluster analysis in a previous study only identified high-risk counties in northern CA, NM and NV. Elevation, suicide and LDS population were positively, and population density was negatively linked with DPD for PR and standard regression (SR) showing differences between the mountain west and coastal areas. Complex relationships between DPD and several variables were identified by PR which was not possible with SR.
   Conclusions: Statistically principled methods like PR are needed for appropriate identification of the highest risk counties and important risk factors given the complex relationships with DPD. Funding for prevention, education and medical services should be targeted at rural, mountain communities in the west which have high %LDS and suicide rates. Counties with high %poverty and %Hispanic were also at high-risk. Individual-level studies are needed to confirm important risk factors in high-risk counties.

AB BackgroundRates of suicide are increasing in the US. Although psychiatric disorders are associated with suicide risk, there is a dearth of epidemiological research on the relationship between suicide attempts (SAs) and eating disorders (EDs). The study therefore aimed to examine prevalence and correlates of SAs in DSM-5 EDsanorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge eating disorder (BED)in a nationally representative sample of US adults. In addition, prevalence and correlates of SAs were examined in the two subtypes of ANrestricting (AN-R) and binge/purge (AN-BP) types.MethodsThe study included 36,171 respondents in the Third National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC-III) who completed structured diagnostic interviews (AUDADIS-5) and answered questions regarding SA histories and psychosocial impairment associated with EDs. We evaluated lifetime prevalence of SA, psychosocial impairment, clinical profiles, and psychiatric comorbidity in adults with EDs with and without SA histories, and temporal relationships between age onset of SA and EDs.ResultsPrevalence estimates of suicide attempts were 24.9% (for AN), 15.7% (for AN-R), 44.1% (for AN-BP), 31.4% (for BN), and 22.9% (for BED). Relative to respondents without specific EDs, adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of SAs were significantly greater in all EDs: AN=5.40 (95% confidence intervals [CIs]=3.80-7.67), AN-R=3.16 (95% CIs=1.82-5.42), AN-BP=12.09 (95% CIs=6.29-23.24), BN=6.33 (95% CIs=3.39-11.81), and BED=4.83 (95% CIs=3.54-6.60). Among those with SA history, mean age at first SA and number of SAs were not significantly different across the specific EDs. SA was associated with significantly earlier ED onset in BN and BED, longer duration of AN but shorter duration of BN, greater psychosocial impairment in AN and BN, and with significantly increased risk for psychiatric disorder comorbidity across EDs. Onset of BED was significantly more likely to precede SA (71.2%) but onsets of AN (50.4%) and BN (47.6%) were not.ConclusionsUS adults with lifetime DSM-5 EDs have significantly elevated risk of SA history. Even after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, those with lifetime EDs had a roughly 5-to-6-fold risk of SAs relative to those without specific EDs; the AN binge/purge type had an especially elevated risk of SAs. SA history was associated with distinctively different clinical profiles including greater risk for psychosocial impairment and psychiatric comorbidity. These findings highlight the importance of improving screening for EDs and for suicide histories.

   RATES; PREVALENCE; AVAILABILITY; REGULATIONS; ASSOCIATION; VIOLENCE;
   MEDIA
AB Background
   Several past studies have found that media reports of suicides and homicides appear to subsequently increase the incidence of similar events in the community, apparently due to the coverage planting the seeds of ideation in at-risk individuals to commit similar acts.
   Methods
   Here we explore whether or not contagion is evident in more high-profile incidents, such as school shootings and mass killings (incidents with four or more people killed). We fit a contagion model to recent data sets related to such incidents in the US, with terms that take into account the fact that a school shooting or mass murder may temporarily increase the probability of a similar event in the immediate future, by assuming an exponential decay in contagiousness after an event.
   Conclusions
   We find significant evidence that mass killings involving firearms are incented by similar events in the immediate past. On average, this temporary increase in probability lasts 13 days, and each incident incites at least 0.30 new incidents (p = 0.0015). We also find significant evidence of contagion in school shootings, for which an incident is contagious for an average of 13 days, and incites an average of at least 0.22 new incidents (p = 0.0001). All p-values are assessed based on a likelihood ratio test comparing the likelihood of a contagion model to that of a null model with no contagion. On average, mass killings involving firearms occur approximately every two weeks in the US, while school shootings occur on average monthly. We find that state prevalence of firearm ownership is significantly associated with the state incidence of mass killings with firearms, school shootings, and mass shootings.

AB Objective: This meta-analysis examined suicide-related events in the acute phases of double-blind, placebo-controlled atomoxetine trials in pediatric and adult patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Methods: A total of 3883 pediatric and 3365 adult patients were included. Potential events were identified from the adverse events database using a text-string search. Mantel-Haenszel risk ratios (MHRR) were calculated for potential suicide-related events categorized according to United States Food and Drug Administration defined codes. Results: In this data set, no completed suicides were reported in the pediatric or adult populations. One pediatric (attempted suicide) (and no adult patient events) was categorized as suicidal behavior in the atomoxetine group. The frequency of combined suicidal behavior or ideation with atomoxetine treatment was 0.37% in pediatric patients (vs. 0.07% with placebo) and 0.11% in adults (vs. 0.12% with placebo) and the risk compared with placebo was not statistically significant (MHRR=1.57; p=0.42 and MHRR=0.96; p=0.96, respectively). In pediatric patients, suicidal ideation only was reported more frequently compared with placebo (MHRR=1.63; p=0.41). Conclusions: Overall in this data set, no completed suicides and 1 pediatric patient suicidal behavior event were reported in atomoxetine-treated pediatric and adult patients. Suicidal ideation was uncommon among atomoxetine-treated pediatric and adult patients, although it was reported more frequently in atomoxetine-treated pediatric patients compared with placebo; the reporting rate difference was not statistically significant. The MHRR of suicidal ideation was consistent with a previous meta-analysis of similar design. There was no evidence of increased risk for suicidal behavior in atomoxetine-treated pediatric or adult patients. Clinical trial registration information: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. The data reported are from an analysis of 23 pediatric and 9 adult clinical trials completed between 1998 and 2011. Ten pediatric (Studies HFBD, HFBK, LYAC, LYAS, LYAT, LYAW, LYAX, LYBG, LYBI, and LYBP) and two adult trials (Studies LYAA and LYAO) were conducted before the requirement to post trials at initiation (ongoing as of July 1, 2005) and, therefore, do not have a registration number. The registration numbers for the 13 pediatric trials meeting this requirement are: NCT00191698 (LYBX), NCT00486122 (LYCC), NCT00386581 (LYCZ), NCT00485459 (S010), NCT00191542 (LY15), NCT00191295 (LYBC), NCT00191906 (LYCK), NCT00192023 (LYCY), NCT00191945 (LYDM), NCT00546910 (LYDV), NCT00406354 (LYDW), NCT00380692 (S017), and NCT00607919 (LYEB). For the seven adult trials, the registration numbers are: NCT00190931 (LYBV), NCT00190957 (LYBY), NCT00190736 (LYCU), NCT00190775 (LYCW), NCT00190879 (LYDQ), NCT00510276 (LYDZ), and NCT00962104 (LYEE).

AB IMPORTANCE Firearm homicide is a leading cause of injury death in the United States, and there is considerable debate over the effectiveness of firearm policies. An analysis of the effectiveness of firearm laws on firearm homicide is important to understand optimal policies to decrease firearm homicide in the United States.
   OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association between firearm laws and preventing firearm homicides in the United States.
   EVIDENCE REVIEW We evaluated peer-reviewed articles from 1970 to 2016 focusing on the association between US firearm laws and firearm homicide. We searched PubMed, CINAHL, Lexis/Nexis, Sociological Abstracts, Academic Search Premier, the Index to Legal Periodicals and Books, and the references from the assembled articles. We divided laws into 5 categories: those that (1) curb gun trafficking, (2) strengthen background checks, (3) improve child safety, (4) ban military-style assault weapons, and (5) restrict firearms in public places and leniency in firearm carrying. The articles were assessed using the standardized Guide to Community Preventive Services data collection instrument and 5 additional qualitymetrics: (1) appropriate data source(s) and outcome measure(s) were used for the study, (2) the time frame studied was adequate, (3) appropriate statistical tests were used, (4) the analytic results were robust, and (5) the disaggregated results of control variables were consistent with the literature.
   FINDINGS In the aggregate, stronger gun policies were associated with decreased rates of firearm homicide, even after adjusting for demographic and sociologic factors. Laws that strengthen background checks and permit-to-purchase seemed to decrease firearm homicide rates. Specific laws directed at firearm trafficking, improving child safety, or the banning of military-style assault weapons were not associated with changes in firearm homicide rates. The evidence for laws restricting guns in public places and leniency in gun carrying was mixed.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The strength of firearm legislation in general, and laws related to strengthening background checks and permit-to-purchase in particular, is associated with decreased firearm homicide rates. High-quality research is important to further evaluate the effectiveness of these laws. Legislation is just 1 part of a multipronged approach that will be necessary to decrease firearm homicides in the United States.

TI Suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior in pregnancy
SO SALUD MENTAL

DE Suicide attempt; suicidal ideation; motives; pregnancy; risk factors
ID POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION; RISK; PREVALENCE; SYMPTOMS; OUTCOMES
AB The aim is to explore the occurrence of suicide ideation and behavior in pregnant women receiving prenatal care and to analyze the motives behind these behaviors.
   Although there are very few studies evaluating the prevalence of the suicide phenomenon (suicide, intentional injuries with or without the aim of taking one's own life, ideas of harming oneself or death) during the prenatal period, it has been reported that pregnancy complications due to suicide attempts occur in 0.4 out of every 1 000 patients discharged from hospitals in the state of California in the United States and in one out of every 283 pregnant women in specialized mental health services. Suicide ideation occurs in 1.4% of English expectant mothers, 0.5% of Finnish ones and 27.8% of US pregnant women with psychiatric disorders. In Latin America, it is estimated to occur in 16.7% of pregnant teenagers.
   Although suicide ideation and suicide attempts during pregnancy ore less frequent than at other times in life, they have major consequences, increasing the risk of death and affecting fetal development and pregnancy itself.
   Method
   Participants: The interviewees comprised 120 pregnant women who come in for prenatal care at 1. a state Health Center providing primary health care and 2. three Health Homes that provide basic medical services, run by the Health Secretariat in Mexico City. Three of the 120 questionnaires were rejected due to incomplete information, which left a total of 117. Sample characteristics include: mean age, 23.2 years (DS=5); mean monthly income, $3,876 (SD = $239); schooling, 69% had completed junior high school while 31% had completed senior high school; 71% were housewives while 29% were also engaged in paid employment. Marital status: 18% married, 19% single and 63% cohabiting.
   Instrument:A structured questionnaire with the following areas: 1. Socio-demographic information (age, schooling, etc.). 2. Indicators of suicidal ideation and behavior: a) Have you thought a lot about death, whether your own, someone else's or death in general? b) Have you wished to die? c) Hove you ever been about to take your own life? and d) Hove you ever intentionally hurt, cut, poisoned or harmed yourself in order to take your own life?3. Timing and motives. If the event occurred sometime in their life, the interviewer explored whether the event took place during the current pregnancy as well as the reasons why it happened.
   Procedure: In the waiting room of the Health Center, expectant mothers were told about the purpose of the study and the informed consent form. In the Health Homes, final year medical students did the same and arranged appointments for the interviews. The some researcher conducted the interviews in the two settings.
   Results
   Suicidal ideation: Thinking a lot about death at some time in their lives was reported by 29 subjects (24.8%) and during pregnancy by 44 (37.6%). The reasons for these thoughts during this last period are: separation from one's partner, death of a child, fear of childbirth, fear of accidents or sickness and interest in the subject of death. Realizing one is pregnant, feeling lonely, the death or illness of someone close and family problems are among the reasons for thoughts about death as well as the desire to die.
   Desire to die: This was expressed by 29 subjects (24.8%) in the post and by nine (7.7%) during pregnancy. Among the latter group, the reasons were: realizing one is pregnant, the death or illness of someone close and family problems. They also mentioned problems with their partners and parents.
   Suicidal intention: Thirteen said that they had been about to take their own lives at some stage (11.1%), while three (2.6% said that they had done so during pregnancy. During this period, this had been caused by problems with their partners.
   Suicide attempts: Ten women mentioned suicide attempts (8.5%) at sometime in their lives, while one (0.9%) did so during pregnancy. This particular case mentioned problems with her partner as being the cause.
   Discussion
   Thinking a lot about death is the most common indicator. It may be explained by disadvantageous social conditions, but also by the particular conditions of pregnancy. In this respect, there are various fears common to expectant mothers who are apprehensive about the well-being of the future baby and anticipate a difficult childbirth.
   As one would expect, suicide attempts are less common than suicide intentions and the desire for and ideas about death. The desire to die, suicide intentions and attempts are less frequent during pregnancy than at other times in a person's life. This may be due to the future mother's feeling of responsibility, or a possible hormonal effect, which act as protective factors. Problems with one's partner are a risk factor for suicide intention and attempts. This is hardly surprising, since marital problems adversely affect women's mental health at different times in their lives, but during pregnancy, they intensify their insecurity at a time of great transition, making them fearful of the future and leading them to wonder about whether getting pregnant was the right thing to do.

AB Objective: Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a notable concern in the United States (US) and strongly associated with mortality. There is a high prevalence of OUD in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the mortality associated with OUD may be exacerbated in patients with PTSD. Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for OUD has become standard of care for OUD and has been shown to reduce mortality. However, there has been little study of MAT and mortality in patients with PTSD and OUD. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in U.S. veterans who had newly engaged in PTSD treatment, were diagnosed with OUD and were provided MAT for at least one day between 2004 and 2013. We assessed mortality for one year following the index diagnosis date. We calculated all-cause mortality as well as death by external cause, overdose plus suicide, overdose, and suicide rates per 100,000. We used hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to compare death rates between patients with high versus low adherence to MAT. We evaluated the impact of high versus low exposure to general substance abuse care. We considered a confidence interval that did not cross one to be significant. Results: A total of 5,901 patients met inclusion criteria. Most patients were men and the average age was 43.3 years (SD = 13.8). The all-cause mortality rate was 1,370 per 100,000 patients. High adherence to MAT resulted in a non-significant, decreased risk for death due to all-cause (HR = 0.73, 95% CI [0.47, 1.13]), external cause (HR = 0.71, 95% CI [0.38, 1.35]), and overdose or suicide (HR = 0.66, 95% CI [0.33, 1.35]). Patients with high exposure (>= 60 days) to general substance abuse care were significantly less likely to die due to external cause (HR = 0.39, 95% CI [0.18, 0.85]) and overdose or suicide (HR = 0.31, 95% CI [0.12, 0.77]). Conclusions: In patients with PTSD and OUD, improved adherence to MAT and greater exposure to general substance abuse care may result in lower mortality. Studies with longer follow-up and larger sample sizes to assess the impact of MAT on suicide are needed to confirm our findings.

AB This paper reviews the psychological health research conducted in the United States in support of combat veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan, using the Military Psychological Health Research Continuum, which includes foundational science, epidemiology, etiology, prevention and screening, treatment, follow-up care, and services research. The review is limited to those studies involving combat veterans and military families. This review discusses perplexing issues regarding the impact of combat on the mental health of service members such as risk and resilience factors of mental health, biomarkers of posttraumatic stress syndrome (PTSD), mental health training, psychological screening, psychological debriefing, third location decompression, combat and suicide, the usefulness of psychotherapy and drug therapy for treating PTSD, role of advanced technology, telemedicine and virtual reality, methods to reduce stigma and barriers to care, and best approaches to the dissemination of evidence-based interventions. The mental health research of special populations such as women, National Guardsmen and reservists, and military families is also presented. The review concludes by identifying future areas of research.

SO OMEGA-JOURNAL OF DEATH AND DYING
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION; NEWS
AB The purpose of this article is to discuss the portrayal of death in modem North American society in the highest circulating English language magazines available in Canada and published either in the United States or in Canada, in 1991, 1996, and 2001. The prevailing underlying frame/discourse of which there were a number of sub-variants, was the notion of the control of death. Stories focused on people taking control of death by 1) passive and active euthanasia, 2) suicide with political and social motivations and messages, 3) suicide deaths among celebrities and the families of celebrities, 4) dramatic murders, 5) issues in the "right to die movement," and 6) new techniques and technologies for life extension. There was a very small minority of articles on miscellaneous issues such as death rates and their variation across geographic region, social class, environmental condition, and cause. The article ends with discussion of the ways that this portrayal of death obfuscates the real lack of control most North Americans, particularly those who are poor or "racialized," have over the timing, or circumstances of death. In addition, as a critical discourse analysis, it discusses the interests that are served by this perspective.

AB A minority of patients who present to the Emergency Department following self-harm are admitted under psychiatric care, whereas almost all patients are discharged back to primary care. From a population perspective, detection of psychosocial needs and attempts at preventing further self-harm may be most effective when based in primary care. Few studies have examined primary care based interventions to reduce self-harm and of those, results have been modest or ineffective. That said, data from treatment of depression in primary care suggests that strategies aimed at treating current distress and identifying ongoing risk factors may be valuable. The merits of risk assessment tools have not been adequately tested in comparison to routine clinical skills but they do act as a useful clinical prompt. Emergency department staff and psychiatrists should alert colleagues in general practice to cases who have presented with self-harm. We suggest that general practitioners should consider inviting all such patients for a routine appointment and offer enhanced aftercare where concerns are high. The workload implications of such a strategy are discussed.

The opposite pattern is observed on Friday. The effects are large. Monday (Friday) alone accounts for over 100% of returns for all anomalies examined for which the short (long) leg is the speculative leg. Consistent with a mispricing explanation, the pattern is driven by the speculative leg.

AB Background: Among risk factors for suicidal behavior, there is growing interest in associations with stable affective temperament types, particularly based on assessment with the TEMPS-A self-rating scale. Aim: As research on this topic has not been reviewed systematically, we synthesized relevant, reported research findings.
   Methods: Systematic searching identified peer-reviewed reports pertaining to associations of suicidal behavior or ideation with affective temperament types evaluated with TEMPS-A. We summarized available findings and applied quantitative meta-analytic methods to compare scale scores in suicidal versus nonsuicidal subjects.
   Results: In 21 of 23 TEMPS-A studies meeting inclusion criteria, anxious, cyclothymic, depressive, or irritable temperament scores were significantly higher with previous or recent suicide attempts or ideation in both psychiatric and general population samples compared to nonsuicidal controls, whereas hyperthymic temperament scores were lower in 9 of 11 reports. These findings were synthesized by random-effects meta-analyses of standardized mean differences in TEMPS-A temperament scores in suicidal versus nonsuicidal subjects. Associations ranked: depressive >= irritable > cyclothymic > anxious > hyperthymic (negative).
   Conclusions: Affective temperaments, especially depressive and irritable, were strongly associated with suicidal risk, whereas hyperthymic temperament appeared to be protective.

AB This study examines mental health and behavioral sequela of heavy drinking in adolescence among Mexican American adults between 18 and 59 pars of age. Previous research with U.S. population samples has shown that role performance and role transitions in adulthood are impaired by adolescent substance abuse problems. To test this hypothesis, data from the Mexican American Prevalence and Services Survey were used. Using bivariate and multivariate analyses, early adolescent heavy drinkers were compared with adult heavy drinkers, light to moderate drinkers, and abstainers on various outcomes. Outcomes included DSM-III-R mood, anxiety, and drug abuse or dependence assessed by me Composite International Diagnostic Interview in a probability sample of 3,000 adults in Fresno, California. Whereas adolescent heavy drinkers had higher lifetime mood and drug abuse or dependence disorders, and higher rates of suicide attempts and behavior problems than abstainers or moderate drinkers, adult heavy drinkers also had high rates of mood disorders and arrests in bivariate comparisons. In multivariate contrasts, adolescent heavy drinkers were three times more likely to have lifetime drug abuse or dependence diagnoses than the other subgroups and were twice as likely to have attempted suicide. Implications for preventive interventions ill the Mexican American population are discussed.

AB In 2010, the United States' Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved the use of four antidepressant medications that could be prescribed to pilots on active flight duty, provided the pilot adhered to detailed policies and protocols. These medications were praised by many in the aviation community who were concerned with pilots underreporting mental health issues or engaging in self-medication. The purpose of this study was to complete a follow-up to a study, initially conducted prior to a 2015 Germanwings accident where a European commercial airliner crashed in an alleged case of pilot suicide. In the previous study, consumers were asked their willingness to fly when their pilot was taking various medications (fluoxetine, loratadine, ibuprofen or clonidine); and the findings suggest that the fluoxetine condition produces the lowest willingness to fly scores. The current study was replicated longitudinally in the weeks following the Germanwings accident. The findings of the current study reveal a significant drop in willingness to fly scores for the fluoxetine condition immediately after the accident; however, there is no significant change to the other medications. After 12-weeks, the fluoxetine condition returns to its pre accident levels. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective We investigated whether high school students reporting easy access to guns were more likely to die prematurely from either suicide, homicide, or an accidental death. Method Based upon the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, we contrasted those reporting easy access to guns, n = 5,185, 25%, with the remaining 75% (n = 15,589) on various sociodemographic characteristics, behaviors, and premature mortalities. Results We found higher rates of suicides, homicides, and accidental deaths among those reporting easy access to guns at Wave 1 or Wave 2. This was only true for males. Those with easy access to guns were more likely to share common sociodemographic characteristics, came from two-parent homes where children had strong and close relationships with parents, where children were more likely to get into fights, do delinquent misdeeds, and engage in other risk-taking behaviors such as increased drinking, drug use, and riding motorcycles. Logistic regression analysis showed easy access to guns remained a significant predictor of premature mortalities when sex, family income differences, risk-taking, and delinquency were used as covariates. Conclusions This study supports previous research and carves out new ground showing easy access to guns acts synergistically with other lifestyle differences to diminish youth life chances.

AB The long-term consequences of exposure to firearm injury-including suicide, assault, and mass shootings-on children's mental and physical health is unknown. Using PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we conducted a scoping review of four databases (PubMed, Scopus, PsychINFO, and CJ abstract) between January 1, 1985 and April 2, 2018 for articles describing long-term outcomes of child or adolescent firearm injury exposure (n=3582). Among included studies (n=31), most used retrospective cohorts or cross-sectional studies to describe the correlation between firearm injury and post-traumatic stress. A disproportionate number of studies examined the effect of mass shootings, although few of these studies were conducted in the United States and none described the impact of social media. Despite methodologic limitations, youth firearm injury exposure is clearly linked to high rates of post-traumatic stress symptoms and high rates of future injury. Evidence is lacking on best practices for prevention of mental health and behavioral sequelae among youth exposed to firearm injury. Future research should use rigorous methods to identify prevalence, correlates, and intervention strategies for these at-risk youth.

ID EXTRACRANIAL VERTEBRAL ARTERY; THROAT; INJURY
AB Worldwide, over one million people commit suicide every year. In the United States, the majority of these cases consist of gunshot wounds, hangings, and drug overdoses. Nevertheless, on rare occasions will individuals exhibit extraordinary creativity in how they decide to end their lives. A decomposing white male was found lying beside his vehicle; blood was noted on the hood. Beneath the deceased's head was a copious amount of blood, and clutched within his right hand was a vehicle radio antenna. A search of a nearby storage shed uncovered drug paraphernalia and in the decedent's bedroom were two handwritten suicide notes. At autopsy, a defect was discovered in the right posterior oropharnyx. Immediately posterior to this injury were fractures of the right transverse processes and interarticular portions of the C2 and C3 vertebrae, with perforation of the right vertebral artery. No other injuries were noted externally. Radiographs of the head and neck showed no evidence of a projectile, and no corresponding exit defect was identified. Postmortem toxicology was positive for cocaine and methamphetamine. We present a case report of a man under the influence of cocaine and methamphetamine employing a car antenna to cause self-inflicted, intraoral penetrating trauma to the cervical spine and right vertebral artery, resulting in exsanguination and his subsequent death.

ID PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE; UNITED-STATES; EUTHANASIA
AB The purpose of this study was to survey the membership of the American Pain Society and the American Academy of Pain Medicine to determine their beliefs about ethical dilemmas in pain management practice. Respondents rated ethical dilemmas for their importance as well as their own competence in dealing with these ethical issues. The survey also included an open-ended question that asked respondents to describe clinical situations in which they had encountered ethical dilemmas. A total of 1.105 surveys were analyzed, with physicians (n = 612), nurses (n = 189). and psychologists (n = 166) representing the professions with the greatest response. Management of pain at the end of life, general undertreatment of pain, and undertreatment of pain in the elderly were the most frequently encountered dilemmas. Qualitative data were analyzed to identify ethical issues in the case examples provided by the respondents. Major themes included inappropriate pain management, barriers to care, interactions and conflicts with others, regulatory/legal issues, euthanasia, assisted suicide, and research issues. We conclude that ethical dilemmas are common in pain management practice and that resolution of these dilemmas requires commitment by individual professionals as well as health systems.

AB Objectives. This study examined whether US-born people and immigrants 25 years or older differ in their risks of all-cause and cause-specific mortality and whether these differentials, if they exist, vary according to age, sex, and race/ethnicity.
   Methods. Using data from the National Longitudinal Mortality Study ( 1979-1989), we derived mortality risks of immigrants relative to those of US-born people by using a Cox regression model after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, marital status, urban/rural residence, education, occupation, and family income.
   Results. Immigrant men and women had, respectively, an 18% and 13% lower risk of overall mortality than their US-born counterparts. Reduced mortality risks were especially pronounced for younger and for Black and Hispanic immigrants. Immigrants showed significantly lower risks of mortality from cardiovascular diseases, lung and prostate cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, cirrhosis, pneumonia and influenza, unintentional injuries, and suicide but higher risks of mortality from stomach and brain cancer and infectious diseases.
   Conclusions. Mortality patterns for immigrants and for US-born people vary considerably, with immigrants experiencing lower mortality from several major causes of death. Future research needs to examine the role of sociocultural and behavioral factors in explaining the mortality advantage of immigrants.

AB While much of the discussion regarding expanding the donor pool for pediatric liver transplantation has surrounded the use of technical variant grafts, little attention has been directed toward changes in the deceased donor population. The aim of this study was to investigate trends in the circumstance of the death of deceased donors used for pediatric liver transplantation. All pediatric liver transplant recipients transplanted between 2002 and 2015 were identified in the UNOS database and were categorized based on the donor circumstance of death. There was no significant correlation between year of transplantation and number of pediatric liver transplants performed, pediatric donors, split livers, or living donors. There was a significant downward trend in donors from motor vehicle fatalities and an upward trend in suicide, non-MVA, and death due to natural causes. There was also an upward trend in drowning, one of the most common mechanisms of death among non-MVA in 2015. While the number of donors who died in MVA has fallen, the number of deceased donors who died from suicide, natural causes, and non-MVA, especially drowning, has increased, maintaining the overall number of pediatric deceased donor livers transplanted.

AB Objective To investigate the association between victimization by peers and suicidal ideation and behavior in 3 samples of adolescents in the United States.
   Study design This study was a secondary analysis of data from 3 cohorts of adolescents: (1) a nationally representative survey of adolescents in grade 7 through 12, Wave I of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, conducted by the Carolina Population Center in 1994-1995; (2) a nationally representative survey, the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2005; and (3) a survey in a high-risk community conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2004.
   Results Controlling for differences in age, sex, race/ethnicity, and depressive symptomology, adolescents reporting more frequent victimization by peers were more likely to report suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. Adjusted odds ratios ranged from 1.67 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.30-2.15) to 3.83 (95% CI = 2.78-5.27) for the different outcome measures and data sets.
   Conclusions Our results provide further support for the need for effective prevention of peer victimization. Inclusion of questions about victimization experiences might aid formal and informal suicide screening efforts. (J Pediatr 2009; 155: 683-8).

AB This article discusses the use of integrated care models, in particular, collaborative care, in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Dr. Williams first discusses how care delivered via a collaboration between primary care and psychiatric providers has the potential to improve both mental health and general medical outcomes for patients with bipolar disorder. He describes promising findings from studies of the use of collaborative care in the treatment of depression, an area where this model has received the most study. Dr. Williams then discusses how such collaborative care models might best be implemented in the treatment of bipolar disorder. In the second half of the article, Dr. Manning focuses on five key issues that are an especially appropriate focus for collaborative care for bipolar disorder and for which the STAndards for BipoLar Excellence (STABLE) Project developed quality improvement performance measures: assessment for risk of suicide, assessment for substance use/abuse, monitoring for extrapyramidal symptoms, monitoring of metabolic parameters (e.g., monitoring for weight gain, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia), and provision of bipolar-specific psychoeducation.

AB IMPORTANCE Fatal self-injury in the United States associated with deliberate behaviors is seriously underestimated owing to misclassification of poisoning suicides and mischaracterization of most drug poisoning deaths as "accidents" on death certificates.
   OBJECTIVE To compare national trends and patterns of self-injury mortality (SIM) with mortality from 3 proximally ranked top 10 causes of death: diabetes, influenza and pneumonia, and kidney disease.
   DATA, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Underlying cause-of-death data from 1999 to 2014 were extracted for this observational study from death certificate data in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research online databases. Linear time trends were compared by negative binomial regression with a log link function. Self-injury mortality was defined as a composite of suicides by any method and estimated deaths from drug self-intoxication whose manner was an "accident" or was undetermined.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mortality rates and ratios, cumulative mortality in individuals younger than 55 years, and years of life lost in 2014.
   RESULTS There were an estimated 40 289 self-injury deaths in 1999 and 76 227 in 2014. Females comprised 8923 (22.1%) of the deaths in 1999 and 21 950 (28.8%) of the 76 227 deaths in 2014. The estimated crude rate for SIM increased 65% between 1999 and 2014, from 14.4 to 23.9 deaths per 100 000 persons (rate ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.03-1.04; P < .001). The SIM rate continuously exceeded the kidney disease mortality rate and surpassed the influenza and pneumonia mortality rate by 2006. By 2014, the SIM rate converged with the diabetes mortality rate. Additionally, the SIM rate was 1.8-fold higher than the suicide rate in 2014 vs 1.4-fold higher in 1999. The male-to-female ratio for SIM decreased from 3.7 in 1999 to 2.6 in 2014 (male by year: rate ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-0.98; P < .001). By 2014, SIM accounted for 32.2 and 36.6 years of life lost for male and female decedents, respectively, compared with 15.8 and 17.3 years from diabetes, 15.0 and 16.6 years from influenza and pneumonia, and 14.5 and 16.2 years from kidney disease.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The burgeoning SIM rate has converged with the mortality rate for diabetes, but there is a 6-fold differential in the proportion of SIM vs diabetes deaths involving people younger than 55 years and SIM increasingly is affecting women relative to men. Accurately characterizing, measuring, and monitoring this major clinical and public health challenge will be essential for developing a comprehensive etiologic understanding and evaluating preventive and therapeutic interventions.

AB After a homicide, survivors are thrust into relationships with a myriad of professionals. For cold case homicide survivors, these relationships are likely to develop into long-term, persistent interactions. Interviews from 24 cold case homicide survivors in the United States reveal that media professionals are often the source of additional trauma, and yet, most survivors expressed a need for continued communication and continued coverage of their case. Utilizing social constructivist grounded theory for data collection and analysis, common themes emerging from the survivors' stories include inadequate coverage of the case, inaccurate portrayal of victim or information, negative reactions to the media, and positive experiences and desire for long-term coverage. Implications and recommendations for survivors and media professionals are detailed within.

ID ADD-ON THERAPY
AB Topiramate is a medication introduced in the United States in 1997 for the treatment of epilepsy. Studies are currently underway to determine its effectiveness in the treatment of multiple conditions including bipolar disorder. It is generally well tolerated at doses commonly used in the clinical setting, however, there is little information regarding its safety in overdose. We report the case of a 24-year-old woman who ingested 4000 mg of topiramate in a suicide attempt. She was asymptomatic following the overdose and did not develop any adverse sequelae. In this article we will discuss the commonly seen side effects of topiramate use and examine the available data concerning topiramate overdose. We will review recommendations for the management of such an overdose. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES-ARMY; SERVICE; SUICIDE; TRENDS
AB Military service has touched most American families; nearly 26 million Americans living today have served in the military - 12 million are over the age of 60. But today's active-duty military is very different from the military of 40 years ago, when men were subject to the draft and wars required more troops. The all-volunteer military - 1.4 million strong - is more educated, more female, more married, and less white than the draft-era military. Today's military also grapples with such issues as inclusion of gays, the role of women, the well- being of military families, and the transition back into civilian life. And debates about the future size, structure, and composition of the U.S. military have assumed new prominence in the political landscape, especially as the country faces new security threats.

AB The authors record the contribution of dentistry to the identification Of victims of one of the most significant tragedies of the 20th century-the mass suicide of members of a religious cult, which initially resulted in 913 deaths and ultimately in 923. Though forensic dentistry played a significant part in identifying victims, the only report by members of the United States identification team did not examine dentistry's valuable role. Furthermore, the dental-investigation aspects have been mentioned merely in passing by the news media despite an infinite number of stories on the tragedy ranging from factual to expose. The dental team's organization, methodology, and significant contributions to forensic dentistry and a variety of remarkable problems that the team encountered and the lessons learned from them are documented in this paper.

AB Professional gardening is a broad occupation that involves a wide range of tasks. Gardeners confront an equally wide variety of physical, chemical, biological and psychosocial hazards in their workplace. Consequently, occupational injuries and mortality are unfortunately common. The aim of this brief review is to collate and summarise the main hazards of gardening, their health effects and control measures. The diversity and size of gardeners' occupational exposures to the hazards outlined in this paper highlight some of the underlying causes of their increased risk of occupational injury or death. The risk can be reduced in many cases by ensuring appropriate protective strategies are adopted. Other ways through which the burden of occupational injury and mortality can be minimised are introduced and discussed in this paper.

AB Despite recent advances in early detection and treatment, prostate cancer is still the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the United States, and approximately 27,000 men will die from it this year. Better treatments are needed for aggressive forms of localized disease and hormone-refractory metastatic disease. Recently, several gene therapy strategies have generated provocative results in early-stage clinical trials, raising the possibility that gene therapy may have the potential to affect both localized and metastatic disease. Much work lies ahead. Nevertheless, for the time being, these studies provide hope that gene therapy may someday earn a place in the management of prostate cancer.

AB This study examines differences in well-being between sexual minority and heterosexual college students and identifies factors associated with well-being among sexual minority college students. A secondary analysis of cross-sectional web-based survey data was conducted. Using propensity score matching, 43 sexual minority students were matched to 43 heterosexual students on age, race, sex, and year in school. Sexual minorities had significantly lower well-being scores compared to heterosexual college students. Among sexual minorities, physical activity, depression, thoughts of suicide, and sleep quality were all predictive of well-being. Understanding issues related to well-being among sexual minorities is important and strategies need to be developed to improve well-being.

AB Over the 20th century sex differences in life expectancy in the industrialized countries have widened in favour of women. Recently, a reversal in the long-term pattern of this differential has been noted in some countries. In Canada, between 1981 and 2000, this differential narrowed by almost two years. Greater than expected improvements in male death rates with respect to heart disease, lung cancer, accidents and violence (excluding suicide) explain a large part of this phenomenon. Change in male and female smoking prevalence correlates strongly with change in sex differences in mortality from heart disease and cancer. The reasons underlying men's greater mortality improvements in regard to accidents and violence are less clear and need further investigation.

AB The objective of the present study was to provide a nationally representative psychiatric epidemiologic investigation of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and its co-morbid conditions. Data from the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC-III) collected between 2012 and 2013 was used. Results indicated that TBI was significantly associated with any lifetime mental health (AOR = 2.32, 95% CI = 1.65-3.70), substance use disorder (AOR = 1.57-1.01-2.42), and violent (AOR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.03-2.65) and nonviolent (AOR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.25-2.70) criminal behaviors. In our study, TBI was highly comorbid with psychiatric disorders and especially antisocial behaviors, both violent and non-violent.

AB Mefloquine (previously marketed in the United States as Lariam(R)) is an antimalarial medication with potent psychotropic potential. Severe psychiatric side effects due to mefloquine intoxication are well documented, including anxiety, panic attacks, paranoia, persecutory delusions, dissociative psychosis, and anterograde amnesia. Exposure to the drug has been associated with acts of violence and suicide. In this article, we discuss the history of mefloquine use and describe plausible mechanisms of its psychotropic action. Mefloquine intoxication has not yet been successfully advanced in legal proceedings as a defense or as a mitigating factor, but it appears likely that it eventually will be. Considerations for the application of claims of mefloquine intoxication in forensic settings are discussed.

AB This essay seeks to chronicle the controversy surrounding euthanasia that came to a head in the United States around 1906, and to situate that debate in a meaningful historical context. An extensive examination of newspaper coverage of the legislative proposals to legalize the practice in Ohio and Iowa reveals that (1) the discourse occurred in a context in which both supporters and opponents of euthanasia generally agreed that the practice already occurred with frequency; (2) the discussion was heavily influenced by a simultaneous controversy surrounding eugenics; and (3) most of the opponents of legalization relied upon practical rather than religious or moral arguments to further their cause.

AB Same-sex attracted youth (SSAY) experience higher rates of negative mental health outcomes compared with their heterosexual peers; however, the association between sexual minority status and academic achievement is less clear. We used four waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to compare 1,279 ethnically diverse SSAY (57% male) based on the degree to which they were "engaged" (65%) or "disengaged" (35%) in school, classified through cluster analysis techniques. The pattern of results indicated significantly better mental health among the engaged group one and 6 years later (e.g., fewer depressive symptoms, less alcohol use), and more occupational and educational achievement eleven years later. The implications of school connection and achievement across a decade of life are discussed.

AB Objectives. We explored the relationship between boarded-up housing and rates of gonorrhea and premature mortality.
   Methods. In this ecological study of 107 US cities, we developed several models predicting rates of gonorrhea and premature death before age 65 from all causes and from specific causes. We controlled for race, poverty, education, population change, and health insurance coverage.
   Results. Boarded-up housing remained a predictor of gonorrhea rates, all-cause premature mortality, and premature mortality due to malignant neoplasms, diabetes, homicide, and suicide after control for sociodemographic factors.
   Conclusions. Boarded-up housing may be related to mortality risk because of its potential adverse impact on social relationships and opportunities to engage in healthful behaviors. Neighborhood physical conditions deserve further consideration as a potential global factor influencing health and well-being.

AB The study of Native childrens development in the United States and Canada has lagged behind that of other populations. As a result, there is limited research literature to inform efforts to address the challenges faced by Native children and their families, including disparities in mental health problems such as substance abuse, suicide, mental disorders, and academic achievement. This article provides a brief overview of the historical context of childrens development in Native communities and introduces the Native Childrens Research Exchange (NCRE), formed in 2008 to facilitate child development research with tribal communities. The following collection of articles, written by NCRE scholars, reviews existing research, highlights challenges encountered in this work, and points to an agenda for furthering developmental research within Native cultures.

AB Objective-In recent decades, in most European countries young adult mortality has risen, or at best has remained stable. The aim of this study was to describe trends in mortality attributable to the principal causes of death: AIDS, drug overdose, suicide and motor vehicle traffic accidents, among adults aged between 15 and 34 years in three European cities (Barcelona, Bologna and Munich), over the period 1986 to 1995.
   Methods-The population studied consisted of all deaths that occurred between 1986 and 1995 among residents of Barcelona, Bologna and Munich aged from 15 to 34 years. Information about deaths was obtained from mortality registers. The study variables were sex, age, the underlying cause of death and year of death. Causes of death studied were: drug overdose, AIDS, suicide and motor vehicle traffic accidents. Age standardised mortality rates (direct adjustment) were obtained in all three cities for the age range 15-34. To investigate trends in mortality over the study period Poisson regression models were fitted, obtaining the average relative risk (RR) associated with a one year increment.
   Results-Young adult mortality increased among men in Barcelona and Bologna (RR per year: 1.04, 95% confidence intervals (95%CI): 1.03, 1.06 in Barcelona and RR:1.03, 95%CI:1.01, 1.06 in Bologna) and among women in Barcelona (RR:1.02, 95%CI: 1.01, 1.04), with a change in the pattern of the main causes of death attributable to the increase in AIDS and drug overdose mortality. In Munich, the pattern did not change as much, suicides being the main cause of death during the 10 years studied, although they have been decreasing since 1988 (RR:0.92, 95%CI:0.88, 0.96 for men and 0.81, 95%CI: 0.75-0.87 for women).
   Conclusion The increase in AIDS mortality observed in the three European cities in the mid-80s and mid-90s has yielded to substantial changes in the pattern of the main causes of death at young ages in Barcelona and Bologna. Munich presented a more stable pattern, with suicide as the main cause of death.

AB Objectives. To examine the impact of right-to-carry (RTC) firearm laws on firearm workplace homicides (WPHs) in the United States from 1992 to 2017.
   Methods. We employed 2 longitudinal methods to examine the average effect (pooled, cross-sectional, time-series analysis) and the state-specific effect (random effects meta-analysis) of RTC laws on WPHs committed by firearms from 1992 to 2017 in a 50-state panel. Both methods utilized a generalized linear mixed model with a negative binomial distribution.
   Results. From 1992 to 2017, the average effect of having an RTC law was significantly associated with 29% higher rates of firearm WPHs (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.14, 1.45). No other state-level policies were associated with firearm WPHs. Sensitivity analyses suggest robust findings. State-specific estimates suggest that passing an RTC law during our study period was significantly associated with 24% increase in firearm WPH rates (95% CI = 1.09, 1.40).
   Conclusions. This is the first study to our knowledge to examine the link between RTC firearm laws and firearm WPHs. Findings indicate that RTC laws likely pose a threat to worker safety and contribute to the recent body of literature that finds RTC laws are associated with increased incidence of violence.

ID STATUS EPILEPTICUS; NONEPILEPTIC PATIENT; UNITED-STATES; OVERDOSE;
   SUICIDALITY; EPILEPSY; IMPACT
AB Background: Tiagabine is a novel antiepileptic that acts by increasing synaptic and extracellular gamma-aminobutyric acid concentrations. Information concerning overdose of tiagabine is limited. After introduction, an increasing number of off-label uses suggested that tiagabine use would increase. However in 2005 and 2008, warnings from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were issued on the risk of seizures in non-epileptic and increased suicide ideation. We evaluated the temporal trends associated with these two warnings as well as clinical outcomes from tiagabine overdose.
   Method: A retrospective review of all single substance tiagabine exposures in National Poison Data System (NPDS) from 2000 to 2012.
   Results: A total of 2147 patients had ingested tiagabine, with a mean of 165 year(-1). This was disproportionally distributed, with a steep rise leading up to 2004 (max 559 year(-1)) and then a significant decline (p < 0.05) between 2005 and 2006. The number of cases reported to NPDS mirrored the sales of tiagabine. Clinical effects were predominantly neurological, with the most commonly reported effects being drowsiness (27%), agitation (19%), confusion (12%), seizures (11%), and tachycardia (10%). In all, 758 patients (35%) showed a major or moderate medical outcome, with no deaths reported. A disproportionate share of the major outcomes was in the suicide attempt group (73%). The majority of patients (75%) were treated in a health-care facility (HCF).
   Conclusions: The HCF usage is likely due to high rate of symptomatic patients (59%) and the large proportion of suicide attempt cases. The frequency of tiagabine cases in NPDS mirrored pharmaceutical sales, with steep declines temporally related to the 2005 FDA warning.

AB Objective: To determine unique associations of suicidal ideation (SI) and lifetime suicide attempts (SAs) in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI).
   Design: Cross-sectional analysis.
   Setting: Outpatient.
   Participants: Individuals with SCI (N=2533) who were 18 years or older with a history of traumatic SCI.
   Interventions: None.
   Main Outcome Measures: Any SI in the past 2 weeks (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire) and any lifetime SA.
   Results: Three hundred twenty-three individuals (13.3%) reported SI in the past 2 weeks and 179 (7.4%) reported lifetime SA. After controlling for other factors, both lifetime SA and current SI were associated with study site and current level of depression. In addition, SA was associated with less education, younger age at injury, having current or past treatment of depression, and having bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. SI was associated with more years since injury and lifetime SA. Several psychological factors were associated with current SI and lifetime SAs, including lower environmental reward and less positive affect. In addition, control of one's community activities and spiritual well-being were associated with current SI. In bivariate comparisons, severity of SCI was also associated with the 47% of the SAs that occurred after injury.
   Conclusions: Several unique associations of SI and lifetime SA in individuals with SCI were identified, including level of environmental reward and control, spiritual well-being, and severity of SCI. These factors bear further investigation as prospective risk factors for suicidal behavior after SCI. (C) 2015 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine

AB Objective: Historically, meeting criteria for a mental disorder has been used as a proxy for the need for mental health services, yet research suggests that a significant proportion of disorders remit without treatment. In this study, risk factors for poor longitudinal outcomes of individuals with untreated common mental disorders were determined, with the goal of identifying individuals with unmet need and informing the development of targeted interventions.
   Methods: Data came from the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), a longitudinal, nationally representative survey of the adult U.S. population (age >= 18; N=34,653). Respondents were assessed for past-year depressive, anxiety, and substance use disorders and mental health service use via face-to-face interviews conducted at two time points, three years apart. Among respondents without a history of mental health treatment, logistic regression analyses examined factors associated with persistence of the disorder, comorbidity, or suicide attempt (that is, presence of any axis I disorder in the past year at wave 2 or any suicide attempt during the follow-up) versus spontaneous recovery of baseline disorders.
   Results: Certain sociodemographic factors, comorbid mental disorders at baseline (such as three or more axis I disorders, adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=1.64, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.27-2.12), and childhood maltreatment (AOR=1.47, CI=1.23-1.75) were predictors of disorder persistence, comorbidity, or suicide attempt in depressive, anxiety, and substance use disorders during the follow-up.
   Conclusions: In addition to considering the presence of a mental disorder, policy makers should consider other variables, such as childhood maltreatment and comorbidity, in estimating treatment need.

TI Research trends in farmers' mental health: A scoping review of mental
   health outcomes and interventions among farming populations worldwide
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Review
ID DEPRESSION; DROUGHT; BURNOUT; SUICIDE; STRESS; YOUTH
AB Background
   Mental health issues among farmers are identified population health concerns. While one systematic review focused on suicide in farming populations in the United States, there have been no scoping studies examining mental health in farming communities worldwide. The objectives of this scoping review were to: provide a descriptive analysis of the literature pertaining to mental health outcomes in farming populations; describe the international scope of the research; and highlight published mental health services and interventions that have been evaluated.
   Methods
   Following Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review framework, five major health and science platforms were used to identify studies examining mental health outcomes in farming populations, worldwide. Studies that met a priori inclusion criteria that were published prior to December 31, 2017 were included in this review. Data synthesis and descriptive statistics were conducted using STATA 15 (R) software; proportions were calculated by country.
   Results
   The initial literature search yielded 9,906 records. After title and abstract screening, 676 articles were reviewed in-full. Of these, 341 met a priori inclusion criteria. Studies included were conducted between 1979 and 2017; the majority (265; 77.7%) were published between 2002-2017. The most frequently measured outcomes were stress (41.9%), suicide (33.1%), and depression (32.6%). Over 70% of studies that examined stress described using quantitative research methods, most predominantly, cross-sectional designs (42.7%). Approximately 64% of studies that measured suicide reported using a quantitative approach; the largest proportion of included suicide studies (33.6%) described using cohort designs. Approximately 84% of studies that measured depression described using quantitative approaches; sixty percent of these studies reported using a cross-sectional study design. Twenty included studies described a mental health service or intervention (5.9%).
   Conclusions
   This scoping review provides a critical overview of the literature examining mental health outcomes in farming populations worldwide. Given the importance of farming and agriculture, this review can be used to ensure future research complements existing work, avoids unnecessary overlap, and begins to tackle the less-studied mental health outcomes amongst farmers. These results can guide researchers to identified gaps in research and services, leading to a more informed approach to future work, and ultimately, a more comprehensive understanding of mental health among farmers worldwide.

AB During adolescence, friends are increasingly important for support and values. Do friends also have a long-term impact on suicidality? This study explored the role of friendship problems (e.g., social isolation) and deviant friends during late adolescence on suicidal ideation and behavior 3 years later.
   Participants were 295 community adolescents (59 % Mexican-American; 41 % European-American) from the United States. Information about their suicidal ideation and behavior, depression, friendship problems, and deviant friends was collected at baseline and at a 3-year follow-up.
   Having deviant friends was a better predictor of suicidality than having friendship problems, with variability by sex and ethnicity. Having deviant friends predicted suicidal ideation among Mexican-American adolescents. Having friends who were disconnected from school was a risk factor for suicidal ideation among European-American adolescents but a protective factor for suicidal behavior among Mexican-American adolescents, especially boys. Depression played more of a mediating role between friendship factors and suicidality for European-American than for Mexican-American adolescents.
   This study's findings suggest an influence of adolescents' deviant friends on suicidality 3 years later. They also call for the cultural and gender grounding of suicide theory, research and prevention.

AB Objective: To determine the association between sleep, mental disorders, and suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempt (SA) among adults in the community.
   Design: Cross-sectional.
   Setting: National Comorbidity Survey (n = 8098).
   Participants: A representative sample of adults in the United States.
   Measurements and Results: Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to determine the association between usual number of hours of sleep during a 24-h period and SI and SA (past 12 months and lifetime). Analyses were adjusted for differences in demographic characteristics and comorbid mental disorders. Additional analyses examined the relationship between hours of sleep and the odds of SA among adults with SI, compared with SI without SA. Short sleep was associated with significantly increased odds of SI (OR 2.5, 95% CI: 1.6-3.9) and SA (OR 3.0, 95% CL 1.4-6.4), and with SA among those with SI (past 12 months). These associations persisted after adjusting for differences in demographic characteristics and mental disorders, though the links between short sleep and SA among those with SI were no longer statistically significant after adjusting for panic, mood, and substance use disorders.
   Conclusions: Short sleep appears to be associated with increased likelihood of SI and SA, independent of the effects of comorbid mental disorders, among adults in the community. Among adults with SI, short sleep is associated with increased odds of SA, and this association seems largely related to the presence of panic attacks, mood, and substance use disorders. Future studies should investigate the nature of these relationships, and whether and how mental health problems may play a role.

AB PurposeLittle is known about the effect of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) on the risks of cause-specific mortality in the community. This study aimed to close this gap by evaluating if ASPD increases risks of cause-specific mortality in population-based residential and institutionalized samples with 27years of follow-up.MethodsData were collected in four metropolitan sites as part of the Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) study during 1979-1983. Records were linked to the National Death Index through the end of 2007. Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for propensity weights and sample weights were fitted to estimate the effect of ASPD on the hazard of dying.Results420 respondents with ASPD (median survival age 71.0years) and 15,367 without ASPD (median survival age 84.6years) were included in this study. Those with ASPD were more likely to die from all causes (HR=4.46; 95% CI=2.44-8.16), suicide (HR=2.81; 95% CI=1.03-7.65), malignant neoplasms (HR=4.09; 95% CI=2.66-6.28), chronic lower respiratory disease (HR=5.67; 95% CI=2.92-11.0), and human immunodeficiency virus infection (HR=8.07; 95% CI=2.03-32.1), but not from accidents (HR=0.58; 95% CI=0.17-1.93) or heart disease (HR=1.09; 95% CI=0.43-2.76).ConclusionsOur findings demonstrate that antisocial personality disorder is a strong predictor of all-cause mortality, and cause-specific mortality. Early identification, treatment, and prevention of ASPD are important public mental health initiatives that could reduce premature mortality among this vulnerable population.

AB Depression can be a serious aliment influencing the lives of millions of persons. Person's health conditions worsen and daily functioning declines in the presence of depression. However, little attention has been given to how depression is accurately assessed in diverse populations from other countries residing in the United States. Thus, this study examined the factor structure, factorial invariance, concurrent validity, and convergent validity of the widely used 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) among emerging adults of Mexican and Central American (e. g., Salvadorians, Guatemalans) men and women residing in the United States. Undergraduate student participants (n = 2,782) completed an online or paper-and-pencil version of the assessment. Support was found for two-factor and one-factor solutions; however, the unidimensional structure was recommended due to the very high correlation between the two factors (r >= .87). The unidimensional scale was invariant between (a) Mexican and Central American descent and (b) men and women. Depressive symptoms (as measured in the PHQ-8) were significantly correlated with another valid and reliable measured of depression, and scores on the PHQ-8 were significantly correlated with theoretically related variables (i.e., quality of life, parental support, and perceived stress).

AB Unipolar major depressive disorder is a common, disabling, and costly disease that is the leading cause of ill health, early death, and suicide in the United States. Primary care doctors, in particular family physicians, are the first responders in this silent epidemic. Although more than a dozen different antidepressants in 7 distinct classes are widely used to treat depression in primary care, there is no evidence that one drug is superior to another. Comparative effectiveness studies have produced mixed results, and no specialty organization has published recommendations on how to choose antidepressants in a rational, evidence-based manner. In this article we present the theory and evidence for an individualized, patient-centered treatment model for major depression designed around a targeted symptom cluster-based approach to antidepressant selection. When using this model for healthy adults with major depressive disorder, the choice of antidepressants should be guided by the presence of 1 of 4 common symptom clusters: anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, and pain. This model was built to foster future research, provide a logical framework for teaching residents how to select antidepressants, and equip primary care doctors with a structured treatment strategy to deliver optimal patient-centered care in the management of a debilitating disease: major depressive disorder.

AB The range of end-of-life options is expanding across North America. Specifically, medical aid in dying (AID), or the process by which a patient with a terminal illness may request medical assistance with hastening death, has recently become legal in eight jurisdictions in the United States and all of Canada. Debates about AID often rely on cultural constructions that define some deaths as 'good' and others as 'bad'. While research has found commonalities in how patients, family members and health care providers define good and bad deaths, these constructions likely vary across social groups. Because of this, the extent to which AID is seen as a route to the good death also likely varies across social groups. In this article, we analyse qualitative data from six focus groups (n = 39) across three racial and ethnic groups: African American, Latino and white Californians, just after a medical AID law was passed. We find that definitions of the 'good death' are nuanced within and between groups, suggesting that different groups evaluate medical AID in part through complex ideas about dying. These findings further conversations about racial and ethnic differences in choices about end-of-life options.

AB The association between thoughts of self-harm and help-seeking among youth with symptoms of depression was examined. Data were drawn from the Health Behavior of School-aged Children Study (n=15, 686), a nationally representative sample of youth in the United States. Analyses focused on comparing help-seeking behaviors among youth with and without thoughts of deliberate self-harm (DSH) when depressed. Depressed youth with thoughts of DSH exhibited different patterns of help-seeking than those without. Both groups most frequently sought help from friends and parents. However, adolescents with thoughts of DSH were statistically more likely than youth without to seek help from friends (DSH: 69.9%; no DSH: 57.8%; AOR=1.46), but less likely to seek help from parents (DSH: 53.7%; no DSH: 73.1%; AOR=0.47). Youth with DSH were more likely to seek help from school officials (AOR=1.05), health professionals (AOR: 1.83), or a counselor (AOR=1.93) compared with those without thoughts of DSH who were more likely to seek help from a sibling (AOR: 0.77) or other relatives (AOR: 0.78). Results may help inform programs to improve identification of youth at risk of self-harm in community and school settings.

AB Background: Investigation of causes of death can help inform intervention policy aimed at reducing preventable mortality.
   Objectives: To assess mortality causes and trends over time and identify target groups with excessive mortality rates among Israeli youth aged 10-24, in order to formulate an Intervention policy for prevention of adolescent mortality.
   Methods: Mortality data for Israeli residents aged 10-24 were extracted from the Central Bureau of Statistics computerized death certificate file for the period 1984-95. Trends were evaluated by cause of death and demographic characteristics.
   Results: The crude mortality rate among Israeli youth aged 10-24, during 1993-1995, was 39.6 per 100,000. Rates were 2.7 times higher among males, increased with age, and reached a peak among 18-21 year olds. Rates were 1.4 times higher among Arabs than among Jews. The sharp increase in mortality among Jewish males of military service age (18-21 years) was due mainly to motor vehicle crashes and suicide. Although overall mortality decreased by 9.4% from 1984-86 to 1993-95, the gap between the subgroups increased. MVC-related mortality increased over time by 100% among Arab males. The rate of completed suicide among Jewish males increased by 110%. Although injury-related mortality is lower in Israel compared with the U.S., similar demographic differentials and trends were found in both countries.
   Conclusions: Suicide among Jewish males of military service age, as well as MVC fatalities among Arab males, present a growing public health issue. Intervention strategies should therefore be targeted towards these subgroups in order to minimize the rates of preventable death.

AB This study examined the association between suicidal ideation and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom trajectories in a nationally representative sample of United States Reserve Component soldiers. PTSD symptoms related to a traumatic event during the most recent deployment were assessed in four annual waves in 2010-2013 among 682 Reserve Component soldiers. Latent Growth Mixture Modeling (LGMM) was used to examine the longitudinal trajectories of PTSD symptoms. The association between the PTSD trajectories and suicidal ideation at waves 2 to 4 was examined in logistic regression analyses. Four trajectories were identified: resilience (73.0%), recovery (11.7%), late onset (11.6%) and chronic (3.6%). Pairwise comparisons demonstrated significant differences between trajectories in risk of suicidal ideation. Among the chronic trajectory group, 50.9% reported suicidal ideation (25.8% late onset group; 11.3% recovery group; 4.0% resilience group). After controlling for baseline characteristics, the late onset and chronic trajectory groups were more likely to have suicidal ideation than the resilience and recovery trajectories, respectively. Findings suggest the late onset and chronic trajectories of PTSD symptoms are associated with higher risk of suicidal ideation. They support the importance of follow-up assessment of suicide risk even among individuals with low PTSD symptoms at homecoming.

AB Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common disorder that is often associated with suicide. We have recently suggested that elevation may play a role in regional variations in rates of suicide. We hypothesize that there is also a significant correlation between incidence of MDD and elevation of residence.
   Methods: The substate estimates from the 2004 to 2006 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) report from SAMHSA was used to extract substate level data related to percentages of people 18 years or older who experienced serious psychological distress or a major depressive episode in the past year. Mean elevation of each substate region was calculated by averaging the weighted elevations of its relevant counties. Average elevation for United States counties was calculated using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation dataset. Pearson correlation coefficients were computed to investigate the association between average substate elevation and rate of serious psychological distress or major depressive episode.
   Results: There was a significant correlation between percentage of people experiencing serious psychological distress in the past year in a substate region and that substate region's mean elevation (r = 0.18; p = 0.0005), as well as between the percentage of people having at least one major depressive episode in the past year in a substate region and that substate region's mean elevation (r = 0.27: p < 0.0001).
   Conclusions: Elevation appears to be a significant risk factor for MDD. Further studies are indicated to determine whether the increased incidence of depression with increased elevation may be due to the hypoxic effects on subjects with MDD. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   ATTITUDES; EXPERIENCES; DESIRE; CARE; END
AB Background: Surveys have shown that physicians in the United States report both receiving and honoring requests for physician assistance with a hastened death. The characteristics of patients requesting and receiving physician aid in dying are important to the development of public policy.
   Objective: To determine patient characteristics associated with acts of physician-assisted suicide.
   Design: Physicians among specialties involved in care of the seriously ill and responding to a national representative prevalence survey on physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia were asked to describe the demographic and illness characteristics of the most recent patient whose request for assisted dying they refused as well as the most recent request honored.
   Results: Of 1902 respondents (63% of those surveyed), 379 described 415 instances of their most recent request refused and 80 instances of the most recent request honored. Patients requesting assistance were seriously ill, near death, and had a significant burden of pain and physical discomfort. Nearly half were described as depressed at the time of the request. The majority made the request themselves, along with family. In multivariate analysis, physicians were more likely to honor requests from patients making a specific request who were in severe pain (odds ratio, 2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-5.7) or discomfort (odds ratio, 6.5; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-16.1), had a life expectancy of less than I month (odds ratio, 4.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-10.8), and were not believed to be depressed at the time of the request (odds ratio, 0.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.1-0.5).
   Conclusion: Persons requesting and receiving assistance in dying are seriously ill with little time to live and a high burden of physical suffering.

AB A series of prominent mass shootings in the United States (US) has prompted renewed interest in revising gun policy. One proposal that has gained political traction is raising the minimum age for purchase and possession of guns to 21. While some commentators have suggested that the public mood may be shifting on gun policy, proposals to raise the minimum age have nevertheless provoked controversy. In this manuscript, we examine the ethical acceptability of raising the minimum age of purchase and possession of guns to 21. First, we examine the nature of the rights claim at issue. Second, we examine liberty-based objections to minimum age laws, and offer counter-arguments to these claims. Then, we examine the nature of the harm to be prevented via minimum age laws. We conclude that gun ownership is an important right, but one that nevertheless is ethical to regulate. We argue that liberty-based objections to minimum age laws are not as strong as critics of these laws claim. While we acknowledge the data limitations on assessing their likely success in reducing gun-related harms, we argue that minimum age laws are an ethically permissible policy strategy. We conclude with several recommendations for further research and policy responses to addressing the toll of gun-related morbidity and mortality.

AB Purpose: To assess the associations of self-identified lesbian, gay, bisexual, and questioning sexual orientation or transgender status (LGBTQ) and military experience with health indicators.
   Methods: We used data from the Fall 2012 National College Health Assessment. The survey included self-identified sociodemographic characteristics, mental (e.g., depression) and physical (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus) conditions, health risk behaviors (e.g., smoking), and social stressors (e.g., victimization). We used modified Poisson regression models, stratified by self-reported military service, to examine LGBTQ-related differences in health indicators, whereas adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics.
   Results: Of 27,176 in the sample, among the military-experienced group, LGBTQ individuals had increased adjusted risks of reporting a past-year suicide attempt (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 4.37; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.39-13.67), human immunodeficiency virus (aRR = 9.90; 95% CI = 1.04-79.67), and discrimination (aRR = 4.67; 95% CI = 2.05-10.66) than their non-LGBTQ peers. Among LGBTQ individuals, military experience was associated with a nearly four-fold increased risk of reporting a past-year suicide attempt (aRR = 3.61; 95% CI = 1.46-8.91) adjusting for age, sex, race and ethnicity, marital status, depression, and other psychiatric diagnoses.
   Conclusions: Military experience may moderate health indicators among LGBTQ populations, and likewise, LGBTQ status likely modifies health conditions among military-experienced populations. Results suggest that agencies serving military populations should assess how and if the health needs of LGBTQ individuals are met. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Chlorpyrifos is one of the most widely used organophosphate insecticides in the United States. Although the toxicity of chlorpyrifos has been extensively studied in animals, the epidemiologic data are limited..
   OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether agricultural chlorpyrifos exposure was associated with mortality, we examined deaths among pesticide applicators in the Agricultural Health Study, a prospective study of licensed pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina.
   METHODS: A total of 55,071 pesticide applicators were included in this analysis. Detailed pesticide exposure data and other information were obtained from self-administered questionnaires completed at the time of enrollment (1993-1997). Lifetime chlorpyrifos use was divided into tertiles. Poisson regression analysis was used to evaluate the exposure-response relationships between chlorpyrifos use and causes of death after adjustment for potential confounders.
   RESULTS: A total of 1,851 deaths (588 among chlorpyrifos users) were observed during the study period, 1993-2001. The relative risk (RR) of death from all causes combined among applicators exposed to chlorpyrifos was slightly lower than that for nonexposed applicators (RR = 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.8 1-1.01). For most causes of death analyzed, there was no evidence or an exposure-response relationship. However, the relative risks for mortality from suicide and nonmotor-vehicle accidents were increased 2-fold in the highest category of chlorpyrifos exposure days.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of a possible association between chlorpyrifos use and external causes of death were based on small numbers. However, the findings may reflect a link between chlorpyrifos and depression or other neurobehavioral symptoms that deserves further evaluation.

AB Objectives.
   1) Determine and compare prevalence for homicide-suicide (H-S) affirmation in community non-patients (N = 478), community patients (N = 158), acute pain patients (APPs; N = 326), and chronic pain patients (CPPs; N = 341); and 2) Develop H-S predictor models in APPs and CPPs.
   Design.
   A large set of items containing the H-S item was administered to the above groups, who were compared statistically for H-S endorsement. APPs and CPPs affirming the H-S item were compared with those not affirming on all available variables including the Battery for Health Improvement (BHI 2) with significant variables (P < 0.001) utilized in predictor models for H-S in APPs and CPPs.
   Setting.
   Community plus rehabilitation facilities.
   Results.
   The above population groups affirmed the H-S item according to the following percentages: healthy community 1.88%, community patients 3.16%, rehabilitation patients without pain 3.64%, rehabilitation AAPs 3.99%, and rehabilitation CPPs 4.40%. For both APPs and CPPs, the H-S item was significantly correlated with some suicidality items and some homicide items. The model for APPs identified "having a suicide plan" as being predictive of H-S affirmation. For CPPs, the items of having thoughts of revenge killing, being motivated to seek revenge without any verbal warning, and the Doctor Dissatisfaction Scale of the BHI 2 predicted H-S affirmation. The APPs model classified 96% of the APPs correctly, while the CPPs model classified 97% of the CPPs correctly. These predictor rates, however, were no better than the base rate.
   Conclusion.
   The prevalence of H-S affirmation within APPs and CPPs is not insignificant. The APPs predictor model points to a close association between H-S affirmation and suicidality. The CPPs model indicates that there is a close association between H-S affirmation, and anger/hostility and anger directed at physicians. These results, however, should not lead to the belief that CPPs are at greater risk for actual H-S completion for the following reasons: 1) H-S is an extremely rare event; and 2) predictive validity of the H-S item for actual H-S completion has not been determined.

AB Social media use by minors has significantly increased and has been linked to depression and suicidality. Simultaneously, age- adjusted suicide rates have steadily increased over the past decade in the United States with suicide being the second most common cause of death in youth. Hence, the increase in suicide rate parallels the simultaneous increase in social media use. In addition, the rate of nonsuicidal self- injury ranges between 14% and 21o% among young people. Evidence suggests that self- harming youth is more active on online social networks than youth who do not engage in self- harm behavior. The role of online social networking on deliberates self- harm and suicidality in adolescents with a focus on negative influence was assessed by conducting a systematized literature review. A literature search on " PubMed" and " Ovid Medline" using a combination of MeSH terms yielded nine articles for data extraction satisfying predefined inclusion/ exclusion criteria. It was found that social networking websites are utilized by suicidal and self- harming youth as a medium to communicate with and to seek social support from other users. Online social networking also leads to increased exposure to and engagement in self- harm behavior due to users receiving negative messages promoting self- harm, emulating self- injurious behavior of others, and adopting self- harm practices from shared videos. Greater time spent on social networking websites led to higher psychological distress, an unmet need for mental health support, poor self- rated mental health, and increased suicidal ideation. In conclusion, greater time spent on online social networking promotes self- harm behavior and suicidal ideation in vulnerable adolescents.

AB Treatment for type 1 Gaucher disease (GD1) decreases morbidity from hematological cytopenias, hepatosplenomegaly and bone complications. Consequently, untreated symptomatic patients for study of late outcomes are hard to find. We identified 184 untreated GD1 patients (67.4% Ashkenazi; splenectomy 51.1%) who died between 1950 and 2010. Here, we report confirmed causes of death for these patients compared with the overall US population. Median age of death 66 years (2-97 years); causes of death (COD) with a high proportional mortality rate (PMR) included malignancies (PMR 1.57), suicide/drug overdose (PMR 3.86), liver disease (PMR 4.76) and septicemia (PMR 9.22). PMRs for CNS/gastrointestinal bleeding, pulmonary hypertension, post-splenectomy complications and Parkinsonism were also increased. PMR for heart disease (0.33) was significantly decreased. Average age at death was normal for heart disease, septicemia, suicide, and malignancies but younger for liver disease and Parkinsonism. COD more prevalent in splenectomy patients included liver disease, septicemia, pulmonary hypertension and GI bleeding. With timely diagnosis, improved risk assessment and obsolescence of splenectomy, GD1-associated malignancies, liver disease, septicemia, pulmonary hypertension, suicide and drug dependency may decrease with early institution of appropriate treatment. Our population of untreated patients is a valuable historical control for studies of the effect of GD1 treatment on premature mortality. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Background: Recent research has suggested that increases in mortality among middle-aged US Whites are being driven by suicides and poisonings from alcohol and drug use. Increases in these 'despair' deaths have been argued to reflect a cohort-based epidemic of pain and distress among middle-aged US Whites.
   Methods: We examine trends in all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates among younger and middle-aged US White men and women between 1980 and 2014, using official US mortality data. We estimate trends in cause-specific mortality from suicides, alcohol-related deaths, drug-related deaths, 'metabolic diseases' (i.e. deaths from heart diseases, diabetes, obesity and/or hypertension), and residual deaths from extrinsic causes (i.e. causes external to the body). We examine variation in mortality trends by gender, age and cause of death, and decompose trends into period-and cohort-based variation.
   Results: Trends in middle-aged US White mortality vary considerably by cause and gender. The relative contribution to overall mortality rates from drug-related deaths has increased dramatically since the early 1990s, but the contributions from suicide and alcohol-related deaths have remained stable. Rising mortality from drug-related deaths exhibit strong period-based patterns. Declines in deaths from metabolic diseases have slowed for middle-aged White men and have stalled for middle-aged White women, and exhibit strong cohort-based patterns.
   Conclusions: We find little empirical support for the pain-and distress-based explanations for rising mortality in the US White population. Instead, recent mortality increases among younger and middle-aged US White men and women have likely been shaped by the US opiate epidemic and an expanding obesogenic environment.

AB A causal relationship between controlled substances and firearm violence has been widely assumed in the United States, and federal law prohibits individuals who are "unlawful users of or addicted to any controlled substance" from purchasing or possessing firearms (68 FR 3750. 2003. Codified at 27 CFR A 478.11). However, the law does a poor job of defining "unlawful users," resulting in recent calls for a revised, actionable definition. Such a definition should be informed by research evidence, but to date the epidemiologic research on the relationship between controlled substances and violence has not been comprehensively reviewed. The initial goal of this review was to summarize the best available evidence on the relationship between controlled substances and firearm violence, but only 1 study specific to firearm violence was identified. We therefore reviewed studies of this relationship using broader measures of interpersonal violence and suicide, all of which included but were not limited to firearm violence, and measures of illicit firearm carrying. Prospective longitudinal studies (n = 22) from 1990 to 2014 were identified by using searches of online databases and citation tracking. Information was extracted from each study by using a standardized protocol. Quality of evidence was independently assessed by 2 reviewers. Aggregate measures of controlled substance use were associated with increased interpersonal violence and suicide, but evidence regarding the relationship between specific substances and violence was mixed. Involvement in illegal drug sales was consistently associated with interpersonal violence. To effectively revise extant federal law and delineate appropriate prohibiting criteria, more research is needed to understand the relationship between controlled substances and firearm violence.

AB Introduction: Increased mortality in people with schizophrenia, compared to the general population, has been consistently reported worldwide. This mortality has been attributed predominantly to "unnatural" deaths-suicide, accidents, and homicide. Recent studies have shown an increase in natural causes of death. Our objective is to compare the mortality of schizophrenic and schizoaffective subjects to the general US population.
   Methods: 319 Olmsted County residents meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder seen at the Mayo Clinic between 1950 and 1980 were followed until February 2005 for a median of 23.5 years.
   Results: At the end of follow-up, 44% of patients were deceased. Mortality was significantly (p<0.001) increased compared to the Caucasian population in the US for persons of like age, gender, and calendar year of birth. The median survival following diagnosis was 36.2 years. Death certificate cited cause of death was cardiac (29%), cancer - including lung (19%), and pulmonary disease (17%). Concerningly, there was no association with the year of diagnosis to survival.
   Conclusions: Tsuang and colleagues showed in 1975 that mortality in schizophrenics and later, those with schizoaffective disorder was significantly increased compared to the US general population. Thirty years later, with a demographically similar population, we have found the same pattern of increased mortality. In light of continued improvements in the general population's lifespan, the survival gap in schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder appears to be increasing. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective: To compare violent injury death reporting by the statewide Medical Examiner and Vital Statistics Office surveillance systems in Oklahoma.
   Methods: Using a standard study definition for violent injury death, the sensitivity and predictive value positive (PVP) of the Medical Examiner and Vital Statistics violent injury death reporting systems in Oklahoma in 2001 were evaluated.
   Results: Altogether 776 violent injury deaths were identified ( violent injury death rate: 22.4 per 100 000 population) including 519 (66.9%) suicides, 248 (32.0%) homicides, and nine (1.2%) unintentional firearm deaths. The Medical Examiner system over-reported homicides and the Vital Statistics system under-reported homicides and suicides and over-reported unintentional firearm injury deaths. When compared with the standard, the Medical Examiner and Vital Statistics systems had sensitivities of 99.2% and 90.7% ( respectively) and PVPs of 95.0% and 99.1% for homicide, sensitivities of 99.2% and 93.1% and PVPs of 100% and 99.0% for suicide, and sensitivities of 100% and 100% and PVPs of 100% and 31.0% for unintentional firearm deaths.
   Conclusions: Both the Vital Statistics and Medical Examiner systems contain valuable data and when combined can work synergistically to provide violent injury death information while also serving as quality control checks for each other. Preventable errors within both systems can be reduced by increasing training, addressing sources of human error, and expanding computer quality assurance programming. A standardized nationwide Medical Examiners' coding system and a national violent death reporting system that merges multiple public health and criminal justice datasets would enhance violent injury surveillance and prevention efforts.

AB Extreme salivary hypofunction is a result of tissue damage caused by irradiation therapy for cancer in the head and neck region. Unfortunately, there is no currently satisfactory treatment for this condition that affects up to 40,000 people in the United States every year. As a novel approach to managing this problem, we are attempting to develop an orally implantable, fluid-secreting device (an artificial salivary gland). We are using the well-studied HSG salivary cell line as a potential allogeneic graft cell for this device. One drawback of using a cell line is the potential for malignant transformation. If such an untoward response occurred, the device could be removed. However, in the event that any HSG cells escaped, we wished to provide additional patient protection. Accordingly, we have engineered HSG cells with a hybrid adeno-retroviral vector, AdLTR. CMV-tk, to express the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) suicide gene as a novel safety factor. Cells were grown on plastic plates or on poly-L-lactic acid disks and then transduced with different multiplicities of infection (MOIs) of the hybrid vector. Thereafter, various concentrations of ganciclovir (GCV) were added, and cell viability was tested. Transduced HSG cells expressed HSV-tk and were sensitive to GCV treatment. Maximal effects were seen at a MOI of 10 with 50 muM of GCV, achieving 95% cell killing on the poly-L-lactic acid substrate. These results suggest that engineering the expression of a suicide gene in an allogeneic graft cell may provide additional safety for use in an artificial salivary gland device.

AB To date, research on suicidality among Asian American women has focused on descriptive statistics and factors associated with suicidal ideation or attempts. As a field, we have little understanding of the precipitants to suicidal ideation, the specificity of intent, the methods contemplated, and the degree of lethality among these women. This mixed-methods study used the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale to assess the suicidal ideation, the specificity of intent, the methods contemplated, and the degree of lethality among 173 Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese American young women of age 18-35 years (M = 23.3, SD = 3.8) who completed clinical eligibility assessments for the Asian American Women's Action for Resilience and Empowerment intervention. Among the 173 women, quantitative results indicated that 110 participants (63.6%) of age 18-35 years (M = 23.8, SD = 3.9) experienced at least one occurrence of suicidal ideation in their lifetime, and 32 participants (18.5%) reported an intent to commit suicide. Almost half of those participants (43.7%) also described plans of moderate to extremely high lethality. Qualitative results demonstrated that precipitants for suicidal ideation may be culturally relevant and include a pressure to achieve and perform, restrictive and controlling parents, and loss of power in intimate relationships. These results suggest that there is a need to examine interventions that promote family support and provide education on ways to establish healthy romantic relationships as well as decrease the internalized need for perfection.

AB Suicide is a public health concern and has been the tenth leading cause of death in the United States since 2008. The Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicidal Behavior is an empirically supported model of suicide. The theory posits that thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness examine the individual's perceived connectedness to others around them and together create suicidal desire. Anxiety is another widespread public health concern, associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts above and beyond the effects of socio-demographic factors and other mental disorders. A key factor in anxiety disorders is intolerance of uncertainty, or the individual's tendency to perceive ambiguous situations and events as being aversive to emotional and behavioral well-being. Additionally, different facets of aggression have been associated with both intolerance of uncertainty and suicidal desire. The current study sought to examine how facets of aggression moderated the associations between intolerance of uncertainty (both prospective and inhibitory) and thwarted belongingness/perceived burdensomeness. Participants were 440 adults recruited online. The hypotheses of aggression facets moderating the association between intolerance of uncertainty and perceived burdensomeness were largely supported with statistical significance for six out of eight models. Similarly, the hypotheses of aggression facets moderating thwarted belongingness were largely supported with significant moderations for seven out of eight models. The results were upheld when using Benjamini-Hochberg test of significance to account for Type I error. Overall, results indicate that aggressive facets can amplify the associations between intolerance of uncertainty and thwarted belongingness/perceived burdensomeness; however, results differed based on the intolerance of uncertainty dimensions.

AB Objective: Bipolar disorder is associated with a high rate of suicide attempt, and alcohol use disorders have also been associated with elevated risk for suicidal behavior Whether risk for suicidal behavior is elevated when these conditions are comorbid has not been addressed in epidemiologic studies
   Method: 1,643 individuals with a DSM-IV lifetime diagnosis of bipolar disorder were identified from 43,093 general-population respondents who were interviewed in the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions Assessments were made using the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule-DSM-IV Version (AUDADIS-IV). Lifetime prevalence of reported history of suicide attempt and suicidal thoughts among bipolar disorder respondents with and without DSM-IV lifetime alcohol use disorders (abuse or dependence) was assessed using chi(2) and adjusted odds ratios with confidence intervals Logistic regression was used to test the relevance of other comorbid clinical conditions to suicide risk in bipolar respondents with and without comorbid alcohol use disorders.
   Results: More than half of the respondents (54%) who met criteria for bipolar disorder also reported alcohol use disorder. Bipolar individuals with comorbid alcohol use disorder were at greater risk for suicide attempt than those individuals without alcohol use disorder (adjusted odds ratio = 2 25, 95% CI, 1 61-3 14) and were more likely to have comorbid nicotine dependence and drug use disorders Nicotine dependence and drug use disorders did not increase risk for suicidal behavior among those with bipolar disorder, nor did they confer additional risk among bipolar respondents who also reported alcohol use disorder Despite greater psychopathological burden, individuals with comorbid bipolar disorder and alcohol use disorder did not receive more treatment or more intensive treatment
   Conclusions: Suicidal behavior is more likely to occur in bipolar respondents who also suffer from alcohol use disorder Interventions to reduce suicide risk in bipolar disorder need to address the common and high-risk comorbidity with alcohol use disorders J Clin Psychiatry 2010,71(7) 902-909 (C) Copyright 2010 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc

AB Women entering prison report high rates of childhood victimization. Women in prison also report higher rates of nonfatal suicidal behavior (self-reported suicide attempts) than women in the general population and similar rates to their male counterparts despite having significantly lower suicide rates than males in the general population. Yet, there is a dearth of research that addresses the relationship between childhood victimization and suicidality for women prisoners in the United States. The purpose of this study is (a) to assess the relationship between childhood victimization and nonfatal suicidal behavior for a random sample of women prisoners; (b) to investigate predictive differences between childhood physical victimization, childhood sexual victimization, childhood neglect, and childhood support; and (c) to determine whether women prisoners with higher frequencies of childhood victimization and neglect are more likely to have attempted suicide than women prisoners with lower frequencies. Results indicate that childhood victimization, neglect, and lack of support are all significantly associated with nonfatal suicidal behavior among women prisoners. Frequency of childhood neglect had a larger effect size than frequency of childhood physical victimization, childhood sexual victimization, and lack of support. The results of this study add to the growing body of literature on childhood victimization and suicidality in general, and nonfatal suicidal behavior for prisoner populations in particular. The article ends with a discussion on clinical implications; particularly the finding that frequency of childhood victimization, childhood neglect, and lack of childhood support matters when determining the risk of suicidality.

AB Objective: To investigate the comorbidity and severity of borderline personality disorder and physical health conditions in a nationally representative sample. Despite the recent trend of examining the relationship between physical and mental health, there has been limited research examining the association of physical health conditions and personality disorders, in particular, borderline personality disorder. Methods: The National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) Wave 2 (n = 34,653; cumulative response rate, 70.2%; age, >= 20 years) was used in the current study. The Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule-Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition was used to assess mental disorders, and self-reports were used to assess physical health conditions. Multiple logistic regression models examined the comorbidity of physical health conditions with borderline personality disorder and associated suicide attempts. Results: After adjusting for sociodemographic variables, common Axis I mental disorders, and Axis II personality disorders, the presence of borderline personality disorder was significantly associated with arteriosclerosis or hypertension, hepatic disease, cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal disease, arthritis, venereal disease, and "any assessed medical condition" (adjusted odds ratios, range 1.46-2.80). In the most stringent adjusted model, diabetes, stroke, and obesity were not associated with borderline personality disorder. Furthermore, a greater likelihood of suicide attempts was associated with cardiovascular disease, venereal disease, and "any assessed medical condition" with comorbid borderline personality disorder than borderline personality disorder alone. Conclusion: Careful screening and treatment of physical health conditions among people with borderline personality disorder are warranted.

AB Introduction: Medical and public health societies advocate that healthcare providers (HCPs) counsel at-risk patients to reduce firearm injury risk. Anonymous online media comments often contain extreme viewpoints and may therefore help in understanding challenges of firearm safety counseling. To help inform injury prevention efforts, we sought to examine commenters' stated opinions regarding firearm safety counseling HCPs.
   Methods: Qualitative descriptive analysis of online comments posted following news items (in May-June, 2016) about a peer-reviewed publication addressing when and how HCPs should counsel patients regarding firearms.
   Results: Among 871 comments posted by 522 individuals, most (57%) were generally negative toward firearm discussions, 17% were positive, and 26% were neutral/unclear. Two major categories and multiple themes emerged. "Areas of agreement" included that discussions may be valuable (1) when addressing risk of harm to self or others, (2) in pediatric injury prevention, and (3) as general safety education (without direct questioning), and that (4) HCPs lack gun safety and cultural knowledge. "Areas of tension" included whether (1) firearms are a public health issue, (2) counseling is effective prevention practice, (3) suicide could/should be prevented, and (4) firearm safety counseling is within HCPs' purview.
   Conclusion: Among this set of commenters with likely extreme viewpoints, opinions were generally negative toward firearm safety conversations, but with some support in specific situations. Providing education, counseling, or materials without asking about firearm ownership was encouraged. Engaging firearm advocates when developing materials may enhance the acceptability of prevention activities.

AB Background: The economic burden of depression was estimated to be $43.7 billion in 1990. A subsequent study reported a cost burden of $52.9 billion using revised prevalence data and a refined workplace cost estimation approach. The objective of the current report is to provide a 10-year update of these estimates using the same methodological framework.
   Method. Using a human capital approach, we developed prevalence-based estimates of 3 major cost categories: (1) direct costs, (2) mortality costs arising from depression-related suicides, and (3) costs associated with depression in the workplace. Cost-of-illness estimates from 1990 were updated to reflect the experience in 2000 using current epidemiologic data and publicly available population, wage, and cost information.
   Results: Whereas the treatment rate of depression increased by over 50%, its economic burden rose by only 7%, going from $77.4 billion in 1990 (inflation-adjusted dollars) to $83.1 billion in 2000. Of the 2000 total, $26.1 billion (31%) were direct medical costs, $5.4 billion (7%) were suicide-related mortality costs, and $51.5 billion (62%) were workplace costs.
   Conclusion: The economic burden of depression remained relatively stable between 1990 and 2000, despite a dramatic increase in the proportion of depression sufferers who received treatment. Future research will incorporate additional costs associated with depression sufferers, including the excess costs of their coexisting psychiatric and medical conditions and attention to the role of painful conditions as a driver of these costs.

   RISK-FACTOR; DEATH; METAANALYSIS; SUICIDE; TOBACCO; CANCER; INJURY
AB BACKGROUND Factors including smoking, drinking, substance abuse, obesity, and health care have all been shown to affect health and longevity. The relative importance of each of these factors is disputed in the literature, and has been assessed through a number of methods.
   OBJECTIVE This paper uses a novel approach to identify factors responsible for interstate mortality variation. It identifies factors through their imprint on mortality patterns and can therefore identify factors that are difficult or impossible to measure directly, such as sensitive health behaviors.
   METHODS The analysis calculates age-standardized death rates by cause of death from 2000-2009 for white men and women separately. Only premature deaths between ages 20-64 are included. Latent variables responsible for mortality variation are then identified through a factor analysis conducted on a death-rate-by-state matrix. These unobserved latent variables are inferred from observed mortality data and interpreted based on their correlations with individual causes of death.
   RESULTS Smoking and obesity, substance abuse, and rural/urban residence are the three factors that make the largest contributions to state-level mortality variation among males. The same factors are at work for women but are less vividly revealed. The identification of factors is supported by a review of epidemiologic studies and strengthened by correlations with observable behavioral variables. Results are not sensitive to the choice of factor-analytic method used.
   CONCLUSIONS The majority of interstate variation in mortality among white working-age adults in the United States is associated with a combination of smoking and obesity, substance abuse and rural/urban residence.

AB ObjectiveTo evaluate the predictive validity of a proposed benign major depressive disorder (MDD) subtype, single-episode uncomplicated MDD', defined as MDD that remits within 6months and lacks severe impairment, psychotic ideation, suicidal ideation, psychomotor retardation, and feeling worthless.
   MethodUsing two-wave National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions data, four groups differing in wave 1 lifetime MDD history (no history [n=27609]; single-episode uncomplicated [n=418]; other single-episode [n=1943]; multiple episode [n=2473]) were evaluated for 3-year follow-up rates of major depressive episode (MDE), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and suicide attempt.
   ResultsFollow-up rates for no-MDD-history, single-episode uncomplicated MDD, other single-episode MDD, and multiple-episode MDD, respectively, were depressive episode 6.1%, 6.9%, 19.5%, 27.1%; GAD 2.7%, 4.3%, 7.8%, 11.2%; and suicide attempt 0.3%, 0.1%, 0.8%, 1.7%. For all validators, 3-year rates for single-episode uncomplicated cases were not significantly different from no-MDD-history rates, but significantly lower than both single- and multiple-episode other-MDD rates. Mild MDD, defined by having only five or six symptoms, did not yield similarly benign results; logistic regression showed uncomplicated' provides incremental validity over mild' in explaining validator rates. Validator differences were not explainable by treatment-rate differences.
   ConclusionSingle-episode uncomplicated MDD is a benign subtype lacking typical MDD negative sequelae. The planned DSM-5.1 revision should reinstitute an extended bereavement exclusion applied to all stressors.

AB Background: Combat fatalities are reported by the media as a frequent cause of military deaths, yet they may not reflect the most common and preventable ways that soldiers die.
   Purpose: The purpose of this study was to quantify the leading causes of death in the military and to identify modifiable behaviors that potentially contributed to death.
   Methods: This was a retrospective chart review of all Canadian Forces members who died during the past quarter century (January 1, 1983, to December 31, 2007) and included autopsy reports, death certificates, coroner reports, hospital records, military reports, and other miscellaneous sources. Underlying cause of death and modifiable behaviors potentially contributing to death were determined.
   Results: A total of 1889 individuals died during the study period, and a cause of death was identified for 1710 cases (91%). Traumatic injuries caused 57% of deaths, and medical disease was responsible for 43%. The four leading specific causes of death were motor-vehicle crashes (384 deaths, 22%); neoplasms (374 deaths, 22%); suicide (289 deaths, 17%); and cardiovascular disease (285 deaths, 17%). Combat deaths accounted for less than 5% of all deaths (70 deaths). Approximately 35% of all deaths were attributable to potentially modifiable behaviors, which included suicide (219 non-alcohol-related deaths, 13%); smoking (159 deaths, 9%); and alcohol use (186 deaths, 11%).
   Conclusions: Public attention focuses on combat fatalities, yet most military members die from other causes. Avoiding future deaths requires targeting suicide, smoking, and alcohol consumption, in addition to trauma care for combat injuries.

   STATES; MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS; METROPOLITAN-AREAS
AB Objectives: Evidence of the association between income inequality and mortality for small rather than large areas is conflicting. This study evaluated community-level income inequality in relation to age- and cause-specific mortality.
   Study design: Ecological analysis.
   Methods: Mortality data were extracted from the Quebec, Canada registry for 1999-2003. For Quebec communities (n = 143), directly standardized mortality rates were calculated for all-cause (overall, working-age and post-working-age), suicide, alcohol, tobacco and cardiovascular mortality. Using 2001 Canada Census data, the tertiles of income inequality measured as the decile ratio, coefficient of variation and median share were calculated. The relative risk (RR) of death was determined using Poisson regression, accounting for median community income, family structure and rural-urban area.
   Results: Income inequality was most strongly associated with alcohol-related mortality (RP(CoefficientVariation) 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.77-0.94), followed by statistically significant but weaker inverse associations with tobacco-related and age-specific all-cause mortality.
   Conclusions: Income inequality in Quebec communities is inversely associated with mortality outcomes, particularly alcohol-related mortality. These associations contrast with positive or null associations observed in studies of larger US and Canadian metropolitan areas, respectively. Community-level studies accounting for individual-level covariates are necessary to clarify the relationship between income inequality and mortality. (C) 2009 The Royal Society for Public Health.

TI A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Demoralization and Depression
   in Patients With Cancer
SO PSYCHOSOMATICS
LA English
DT Article
ID VALIDATION; DIAGNOSIS; DISTRESS; WISH
AB Background: Demoralization is a psychological response that is frequently observed in patients with cancer or advanced diseases. Depression and demoralization syndrome in patients with cancer are closely related to suicidal behavior.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to explore the factors affecting demoralization of patients with cancer from a depression perspective, to assist with distinguishing patient emotions and provide appropriate intervention as early as possible, thereby enabling patients to receive proper care.
   Methods: A systematic review and metaanalysis was employed in this study. The databases included Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane, PubMedl MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Centre for European Policy Studies, and reference lists of articles. Experts in this field also were contacted. Based on inclusion criteria, 2 investigators selected the research and reviewed each study's quality according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Five correlational studies with 32 subjects were identified.
   Results: The countries of studies included Australia, Germany, Taiwan, and the United States. There was a statistically significant difference in depression between patients with cancer in the high-demoralization group and those of the low-demoralization group (odds ratio = 9.65, 95% CI: 6.99-13.33, Z = 15.002, p < 0.0001). Four studies regarded demoralization and depression as distinguishable.
   Conclusions: The demoralization of patients with cancer was highly correlated with depression. Therefore, the suicide risk of demoralized patients without depression must also be assessed to prevent patients with high suicide risk from being neglected. If medical staff can perceive patient's demoralization issues earlier, they can more effectively prevent patients' depression from occurring, which benefits suicide prevention.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between the alcohol policy environment and alcohol involvement in homicide victims in the United States, overall and by sociodemographic groups. Method: To characterize the alcohol policy environment, the presence, efficacy, and degree of implementation of 29 alcohol policies were used to determine Alcohol Policy Scale (APS) scores by state and year. Data about homicide victims from 17 states from 2003 to 2012 were obtained from the National Violent Death Reporting System. APS scores were used as lagged exposure variables in generalized estimating equation logistic regression models to predict the individual-level odds of alcohol involvement (i.e., blood alcohol concentration [BAC] > 0.00% vs. = 0.00% and BAC >= 0.08% vs. <= 0.079%) among homicide victims. Results: A 10 percentage point increase in APS score (representing a more restrictive policy environment) was associated with reduced odds of alcohol-involved homicide with BAC greater than 0.00% (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.89, 95% CI [0.82, 0.99]) and BAC of 0.08% or more (AOR = 0.91, 95% CI [0.82, 1.02]). In stratified analyses of homicide victims, more restrictive policy environments were significantly protective of alcohol involvement at both BAC levels among those who were female, ages 21-29 years, Hispanic, unmarried, victims of firearm homicides, and victims of homicides related to intimate partner violence. Conclusions: More restrictive alcohol policy environments were associated with reduced odds of alcohol-involved homicide victimization overall and among groups at high risk of homicide. Strengthening alcohol policies is a promising homicide prevention strategy.

AB We explore the impact of the Stand Your Ground (SYG) law on gun deaths by degree of urbanization. Unlike firearm homicides the definition of firearm deaths does not depend on the broadening of the self-defense provision that the SYG law represents. Using a difference-in-difference design, we find that the SYG law had no impact on gun deaths at the state level. However, once the U.S. states are disaggregated into portions by degree of urbanization-central city, suburb, small urban area and rural area-we find that the law increased gun deaths in the central cities and the suburbs, and had no impact in smaller urban areas and rural areas. These findings are consistent with the fact that there is a great divide between urban and rural areas in terms of ownership and usage of guns, attitudes towards guns, and the implications thereof. The finding of increased violence in the suburbs is of particular interest in the historical backdrop whereby the growth of the suburbs, to a large extent, may have been motivated by a desire to escape crime and violence.

AB The presence of firearms and their unsafe storage in the home can increase risk of fire arm-related death and injury, but public opinion suggests that fire arm ownership is a protective factor against gun violence. This study examined the effects of a recent nearby active shooter incident on gun ownership and storage practices among families with young children. A series of regression models, with data from the nationally representative Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort merged with the FBI's Active Shooter Incidents data collected in 2003-2006, were used to examine whether household gun ownership and storage practices differed in the months prior to and following an active shooter incident that occurred anywhere in the United States or within the same state. Approximately one-fifth of young children lived in households with one or more guns; of these children, only two-thirds lived in homes that stored all guns in locked cabinets. Results suggest that the experience of a recent active shooter incident was associated with an increased likelihood of storing all guns locked, with the magnitude dependent on the temporal and geographic proximity of the incident. The severity of the incident, defined as the number of fatalities, predicted an increase in storing guns locked. Findings suggest that public shootings change behaviors related to firearm storage among families with young children. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Stray bullet shootings contribute to a sense of risk in affected communities but have rarely been studied. We describe the epidemiology and clinical aspects of stray bullet shootings in the United States.
   METHODS: We defined a case as a shooting event involving death or injury to a person and meeting criteria for a stray bullet mechanism of injury. From March 1, 2008, to February 28, 2009, we conducted real-time surveillance using two automated Internet news searches for the term "stray bullet.'' Secondary searches were performed to identify new cases and additional news reports.
   RESULTS: We reviewed 1,996 nonduplicate news reports for 501 shooting events, of which 284 (56.7%) met our case criteria. There were 317 persons injured by stray bullets, of whom 65 (20.5%) died. Most cases (59.2%) involved interpersonal violence. When compared with persons killed or injured in firearm-related assaults or unintentional shootings generally in the United States in 2007, those killed or injured by stray bullets were more likely to be female (44.8% and 10.7%, respectively; odds ratio, 7.4; 95% confidence interval, 5.9-9.3) and outside the age range 15 years to 34 years (55.5% and 27.0%, respectively; odds ratio, 5.6; 95% confidence interval, 4.3-7.3). Most stray bullet victims (81.4%) were apparently unaware of the events leading to the gunfire that caused their injuries. Shooters were predominantly male (95.9%); 62.0% were aged 15 years to 34 years. Eighteen deaths (27.7%) occurred at the scene of the shooting and 55 (84.6%) on the day of the shooting. The case-fatality ratio for stray bullet shootings was somewhat higher than that for firearm-related assaults or unintentional shootings in the United States in 2007.
   CONCLUSION: Stray bullet shootings are epidemiologically distinct from other firearm-related injury events. It is likely that not all stray bullet shootings were identified, there may have been differential reporting related to severity of outcome, and missing data were common.

AB IMPORTANCE Suicide is the second leading cause of death among US adolescents, and in-home firearm access is an independent risk factor for suicide. Given recommendations to limit firearm access by those with mental health risk factors for suicide, we hypothesized that adolescents with such risk factors would be less likely to report in-home firearm access.
   OBJECTIVES To estimate the prevalence of self-reported in-home firearm access among US adolescents, to quantify the lifetime prevalence of mental illness and suicidality (ie, suicidal ideation, planning, or attempt) among adolescents living with a firearm in the home, and to compare the prevalence of in-home firearm access between adolescents with and without specific mental health risk factors for suicide.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional analysis of data from the National Comorbidity Survey-Adolescent Supplement, a nationally representative survey of 10 123 US adolescents (age range, 13-18 years) who were interviewed between February 2001 and January 2004 (response rate 82.9%).
   EXPOSURES Risk factors for suicide, including a history of any mental health disorder, suicidality, or any combination of the 2.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Self-reported access to a firearm in the home.
   RESULTS One in three respondents (2778 [29.1%]) of the weighted survey sample reported living in a home with a firearm and responded to a question about firearm access; 1089 (40.9%) of those adolescents reported easy access to and the ability to shoot that firearm. Among adolescents with a firearm in home, those with access were significantly more likely to be older (15.6 vs 15.1 years), male (70.1% vs 50.9%), of non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity (86.6% vs 78.3%), and living in high-income households (40.0% vs 31.8%), and in rural areas (28.1% vs 22.6%) (P < .05 for all). Adolescents with firearm access also had a higher lifetime prevalence of alcohol abuse (10.1% vs 3.8%, P < .001) and drug abuse (11.4% vs 6.9%, P < .01) compared with those without firearm access. In multivariable analyses, adolescents with a history of mental illness without a history of suicidality (prevalence ratio [PR], 1.13; 95% CI, 0.98-1.29) and adolescents with a history of suicidality with or without a history of mental illness (PR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.96-1.51) were as likely to report in-home firearm access as those without such histories.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Adolescents with risk factors for suicide were just as likely to report in-home firearm access as those without such risk factors. Given that firearms are the second most common means of suicide among adolescents, further attention to developing and implementing evidence-based strategies to decrease firearm access in this age group is warranted.

AB Objectives: One of the first stages in the development of new clinical decision rules (CDRs) is determination of need. This study examined the clinical priorities of emergency physicians (EPs) working in Australasia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States for the development of future CDRs.
   Methods: The authors administered an e-mail and postal survey to members of the national emergency medicine (EM) associations in Australasia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Results were analyzed via frequency distributions.
   Results: The total response rate was 54.8% (1,150/2,100). The respondents were primarily male (74%), with a mean age of 42.5 years (SD +/- 8), and a mean of 12 years of experience (SD +/- 7). The top 10 clinical priorities (% selected) were: 1) investigation of febrile child < 36 months (62%); 2) identification of central or serious vertigo (42%); 3) lumbar puncture or admission of febrile child < 3 months (41%); 4) imaging for suspected transient ischemic attack (39%); 5) admission for anterior chest pain (37%); 6) computed tomography (CT) angiography for pulmonary embolus (30%); 7) admission for suicide risk (29%); 8) ultrasound for pain or bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy (28%); 9) nonspecific weakness in elders (26%); and 10) CT for abdominal pain (25%). Between study countries, there was consistency in identification of clinical problems, but variation in prioritization.
   Conclusions: This international survey identified the sampled EPs' priorities for the future development of CDRs. The top priority overall was investigation of the febrile child < 36 months. These results will be valuable to researchers for future development of CDRs in EM that are relevant internationally.

AB BACKGROUND Poor mental health outcomes persist among adolescent youth. Secondary schools play a critical role in fostering positive mental health by implementing policies and practices grounded in evidence. The factors associated with implementation, however, are unclear. This study examines which school- and state-level factors are associated with improved implementation of mental health policies and practices at secondary schools across the United States. METHODS US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data stemming from 3 datasets (School Health Policies and Practices, School Health Profiles, and Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System) surveys were integrated and analyzed. RESULTS Health educator certification, school use of data during school improvement planning, presence of a health/safety coordinator, presence of a health council and state-provided health educator professional development in mental health and suicide prevention were each significantly positively associated with schools' implementation of mental health policies and practices. CONCLUSIONS To promote improved implementation of mental health policies and practices in schools and provide better support for youth mental health outcomes, the use of certified health educators and health-related supports should be considered. State health and education agencies should undertake evaluations of its mental health practices to ensure the assistance they offer to schools is evidence based.

DT Article
AB Recent years have brought about a rapid shift in the approach that many states take towards the utilization of medical marijuana. Currently, thirty-nine states, the District of Columbia, and Guam have legalized some form of medical marijuana. Despite this progress, federal policies continue to inhibit United States veterans from obtaining the relief that such laws provide to other citizens. There are many sobering statistics regarding the abnormally high rate of drug addiction and suicide among veterans. Currently, too many veterans suffering from lingering pain or post-traumatic stress disorder are unable to obtain access to medical marijuana and instead must resort to self-medication or reliance on potentially addictive opioids. Policymakers need to act now to ensure that the men and women who served their country in the armed forces have access to the medical care they need. The federal government must formalize its current practice of not prosecuting under federal marijuana laws in states that have adopted medical marijuana programs. Congress and the executive branch must act to give Veterans Affairs doctors the latitude to openly discuss medical marijuana with their patients and help them obtain medical marijuana cards and treatment in the growing number of states with medical marijuana programs. Further, this administration needs to lift the remaining barriers to research on and testing of the medical benefits of medical marijuana.

AB Background: No definitive guidelines have been established in the United States for postexposure immunization and prophylaxis ( PEP) to hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the event of a traumatic explosive event.
   Methods: The American Medical Association's Center for Public Health Preparedness and Disaster Response assembled a US-Israeli panel of experts, including representatives from disaster medicine, trauma surgery, occupational health, and infectious disease to determine guidelines for adult and pediatric victims following a traumatic explosive event. The panel reviewed the existing Israeli and United Kingdom protocols, previously published Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance on occupational and nonoccupational exposures to HBV, HCV, and HIV, before reaching consensus on preliminary guidelines for the United States.
   Results: These guidelines recommend an age-appropriate dose and schedule for HBV PEP for individuals presenting from the scene with nonintact skin or mucous membrane exposure, and they also consider HCV and HIV testing in individuals presenting with possible nonintact skin or mucous membrane exposure. The guidelines do not recommend PEP for individuals presenting from the scene with possible superficial skin exposure.
   Conclusions: These recommendations offer PEP guidance for bloodborne pathogens and are limited in scope. These recommendations do not address general wound PEP such as tetanus or the need for antibiotics. It is hoped that these guidelines will fill an urgent gap in preparedness until definitive, comprehensive guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are published.

TI Vitamin E Acetate as a Plausible Cause of Acute Vaping-related Illness
SO CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE

DT Review
DE evali; vaping; lung injury; vitamin e
AB The United States Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been working with state investigators on reported cases of lung illnesses linked to e-cigarette or vaping products. Symptoms of difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, chest pains, gastrointestinal sickness leading to serious lung damage and death has been linked to the risk behavior of using vaping products bought on the streets in healthy young people. CDC has detected vitamin E acetate as a chemical of concern among people with the lung injury. Vitamin E acetate is a condensing agent in vaping products, and all injured lung fluid samples appear to harbor this agent. The mysterious outbreak is identified in individuals vaping within the 90 days, ranging over a few days to developing over several weeks. There is growing evidence that vaping is hazardous to your health including immediate health dangers such as death from respiratory causes, long term health effects, cardiovascular events, depression which increases the risk of suicidal thoughts and suicide. This review article summarizes the growing knowledge of acute respiratory complications associated with vaping.

AB This chapter offers narratives of the authors' own experience and ruminations on the power of arts-based engagement to promote healing. Our intention is to respond to colonization, historical trauma and the ongoing suffering present in neo-colonial societies. We assert that both the "colonized" and the "colonizers" are in need of healing and social change. One way that healing can be effected, or at least initiated, is through the arts. We tell our own stories in support of this argument. Our offering is one of embodied and emplaced personal experience and personal connections with each other and with others across time and space. We link our stories with a growing international literature on intergenerational trauma and healing and community based arts projects we have been involved with in the United States, Aotearoa, and Australia.

AB Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is characterized by a pattern of socially irresponsible, exploitative, and guiltless behaviour. ASPD is associated with co-occurring mental health and addictive disorders and medical comorbidity. Rates of natural and unnatural death (suicide, homicide, and accidents) are excessive. ASPD is a predictor of poor treatment response. ASPD begins early in life, usually by age 8 years. Diagnosed as conduct disorder in childhood, the diagnosis converts to ASPD at age 18 if antisocial behaviours have persisted. While chronic and lifelong for most people with ASPD, the disorder tends to improve with advancing age. Earlier onset is associated with a poorer prognosis. Other moderating factors include marriage, employment, early incarceration (or adjudication during childhood), and degree of socialization.

AB Austin and Kim (International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology 44, 204-221, 2000) tested the relationship between gender equality and rape victimization by employing an international data set. The current study advances Austin and Kim's (International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology 44, 204-221, 2000) work by employing more variables, such as absolute measures of female socioeconomic status and Muslim and Latin American regional indicators. Additionally, the current work utilizes a larger and updated international data set from The United Nations' Surveys on Crime Trends and the Operations of Criminal Justice Systems. The results of multiple regression analyses partially support backlash hypotheses, but not the amelioration hypothesis. An interesting finding of this work is that developed countries display a higher level of sexual violence than their developing counterparts, which is inconsistent with the perspective of the civilizing process on violence. Additionally, Muslim countries register lower sexual violence than non-Muslim ones, while Latin American countries exhibit higher sexual violence than non-Latin American ones.

AB Context: Many states and local areas are affected by the national epidemic of drug-related mortality, which recently has shown signs of a rising "licit-to-illicit drug" death ratio. Appropriate local public health surveillance can help monitor and control this epidemic. Objective: Using our state as an example, we sought to illustrate how to describe the changes in drug death rates, causes, and circumstances. In contrast to most other surveillance reports, our approach includes both drug-induced and drug-related deaths as well as both demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of decedents. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: All residents of the state of Wisconsin. Participants: Decedents from 1999 to 2008. Main Outcome Measure: Annual numbers and population-based rates of deaths due to drugs, including both identified and unidentified drugs. Information was obtained from death certificates with any of approximately 270 underlying, immediate, or contributing cause-of-death codes from the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. Results: Drug-related death rates increased during much of the 10-year study period, and the male-to-female death ratio rose. The median age at death from drug-related causes was 43 years. Opioid analgesic poisoning surpassed cocaine and heroin poisoning as the most frequent type of fatal drug poisoning. Of all 4828 deaths from drug-related causes-virtually all of which were certified by a county medical examiner or coroner-3410 (71%) were unintentional and 1053 (22%) were suicides. The unintentional-to-suicide death rate ratio grew from 1.6 to 3.5 during the study period. Methadone-related deaths increased from 10 in 1999 to 118 in 2008 (1080%), while benzodiazepine-related deaths rose from 23 to 106 (361%). Conclusions: Although premature deaths from drug use and abuse continue to rise, even surpassing deaths due to motor vehicle crash in some states, "multiple causes of death" information from death certificates is available to monitor their occurrence and nature and to inform selection of prevention strategies.

AB Medical and public health organizations have recommended that health professionals discuss firearm safety with patients at risk for gun-related injury, yet few health professionals do so. Concerns that patients may view conversations about firearms as inappropriate have been reported in prior studies. Using state-representative data from the 2018 California Safety and Wellbeing Survey, this study found that most Californians report gun safety conversations with health professionals to be at least sometimes appropriate when these conversations involved a patient who had a known risk factor for firearm-related harm (depending on the risk factor, 83.7-90.2 percent among all respondents and 70.0-91.2 percent among firearm owners). Majorities of respondents also found intervention by health professionals for those at imminent risk to be at least sometimes appropriate (depending on the intervention, 84.0-89.9 percent among all respondents and 82.6-91.0 percent among firearm owners). These findings can inform health policy and education on clinical strategies for preventing firearm-related harm.

AB Numerous adolescents in the United States experience peer cybervictimization, which is associated with a series of internalizing (e.g., depression, anxiety, anger) and externalizing (e.g., aggression, substance use, risky sexual behavior) problems. The current study provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing research on these relationships. Included in the meta-analyses are 239 effect sizes from 55 reports, representing responses from 257,678 adolescents. The results of a series of random effects meta-analyses using robust variance estimation indicated positive and significant relationships between peer cybervictimization and a series of internalizing and externalizing problems, with point estimates of this relationship ranging from Pearson's r =.14 to .34. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB In the early 20th century, contraceptives were illegal and, for many, especially religious groups, taboo. But, in the span of just two years, between 1929 and 1931, many of the United States' most prominent religious groups pronounced contraceptives to be moral and began advocating for the laws restricting them to be repealed. Met with everything from support, to silence, to outright condemnation by other religious groups, these pronouncements and the debates they caused divided the American religious field by an issue of sex and gender for the first time. This article explains why America's religious groups took the positions they did at this crucial moment in history. In doing so, it demonstrates that the politics of sex and gender that divide American religion today is deeply rooted in century-old inequalities of race and class.

AB The American exceptionalism thesis holds that American political culture produces an unusually litigious society. The us Christian right has participated in litigation, especially in constitutional rights cases dealing with issues such as religious schools and abortion. However, since 1982 Canada has had a constitutional Charter of Rights and an increasingly active Christian right of its own. We compare data on Christian right involvement in education, abortion, and "right to die" (euthanasia, assisted suicide or mercy killing) cases at the Supreme Court level in both countries. Among North America's Christian conservatives, exceptionalism has eroded, but not disappeared. We employ interviews and data on religious interest groups to analyze the sources of legal mobilization, and find that it is a matter not just of political culture, but also resource mobilization, political opportunity structures, and religious worldviews.

AB Multiple-homicide school shootings are rare events, but when they happen they significantly impact individuals, the school and the community. We focus on multiple-homicide incidents and identified mental health issues of shooters. To date, studies of school shootings have concluded that no reliable profile of a shooter exists, so risk should be assessed using comprehensive threat assessment protocols. Existing studies primarily utilize retrospective case histories or media accounts. The field requires more empirical and systematic research on all types of school shootings including single victim incidents, those that result in injury but not death and those that are successfully averted. We discuss current policies and practices related to school shootings and the role of mental health professionals in assessing risk and supporting surviving victims.

AB Background: The relationship between efavirenz use and suicidality is not well-defined.
   Objective: To compare time to suicidality with efavirenz-containing versus efavirenz-free antiretroviral regimens for initial treatment of HIV.
   Design: Participant-level data were analyzed from 4 AIDS Clinical Trials Group, antiretroviral-naive studies conducted from 2001 to 2010. Within each study, participants were randomly assigned to an efavirenz-containing (n = 3241) or efavirenz-free (n = 2091) regimen. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00013520 [A5095], NCT00050895 [A5142], NCT00084136 [A5175], and NCT 00118898 [A5202])
   Setting: AIDS Clinical Trials Group sites; 74% of participants enrolled in the United States.
   Patients: Antiretroviral-naive participants.
   Intervention: Efavirenz versus efavirenz-free regimens.
   Measurements: Suicidality was defined as suicidal ideation or attempted or completed suicide. Groups were compared with a hazard ratio and 95% CI estimated from a Cox model, stratified by study.
   Results: Seventy-three percent of participants were men, the median age was 37 years, and 32% had documented psychiatric history or received psychoactive medication within 30 days before entering the study. Median follow-up was 96 weeks. Suicidality incidence per 1000 person-years was 8.08 (47 events) in the efavirenz group and 3.66 (15 events) in the efavirenz-free group (hazard ratio, 2.28 [95% CI, 1.27 to 4.10]; P = 0.006). Incidence of attempted or completed suicide was 2.90 (17 events) and 1.22 (5 events) in the efavirenz and efavirenz-free groups, respectively (hazard ratio, 2.58 [CI, 0.94 to 7.06]; P = 0.065). Eight suicides in the efavirenz group and 1 in the efavirenz-free group were reported.
   Limitation: There was not a standardized questionnaire about suicidal ideation or attempt. Efavirenz was open-label in 3 of 4 studies.
   Conclusion: Initial treatment with an efavirenz-containing antiretroviral regimen was associated with a 2-fold increased hazard of suicidality compared with a regimen without efavirenz.

AB The current study examined gender diverse students' (students who identify as a gender other than cisgender) perceptions of campus climate, experiences with discriminatory behaviors, and the extent to which discriminatory experiences were reported at one Midwestern university in the U.S. Data were obtained from a campus climate survey involving 1848 students (70% cisgender women, 28% cisgender men, and 2% gender diverse). Although the results revealed that gender diverse students reported significantly less favorable perceptions of climate and more experience with discriminatory behaviors than did cisgender students, gender diverse students were less likely to officially report these experiences. These results have implications for university personnel developing programs promoting inclusivity and administrators looking to improve discrimination/harassment reporting procedures.

AB The present research examined the latent structure of self-injurious behavior (SIB) to determine whether suicidal self-injury (SSI) and nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) reflect categorically distinct types of SIB or dimensional variations of the same construct. Participants consisted of 1,525 female undergraduates across several universities in the United States who completed the Survey of College Mental Health and Well Being and endorsed a history of SIB. Empirically derived indicators representing intent to die, suicidal history, frequency of SIB, severity of SIB, and number of methods of SIB were submitted to three mathematically independent taxometric procedures. Results of multiple consistency tests converged to indicate that the latent structure of SIB is continuous, with individuals who engage in SSI and NSSI differing in degree rather than kind. The implications of these dimensional findings for the theoretical conceptualization, assessment, and treatment of SIB are discussed.

AB American Indian/Alaska Native youth represent the strength and survival of many Nations and Tribes. However, the aftermath of colonialism has resulted in numerous health disparities and challenges for Native youth, including the highest rate of suicide in the United States. With the aims of elucidating the causes of behavioral health disparities, eliminating them, and improving behavioral health care for Native youth, a partnership of providers, community members, and university faculty and staff completed a comprehensive literature review, conducted advisory meetings with 71 American Indian youth, parents, and elders, surveyed 25 service providers, and engaged in ongoing consultation with traditional practitioners. Results from the multiple sources were synthesized and are reported with 20 policy, provider, and research recommendations that recognize the importance of moving beyond exclusive reliance on western models of care and that seek to foster transformation of individuals, families, communities, behavioral health service systems of care, and social structures.

Results demonstrated significant reductions in prevalence rates for PDs (9.1% versus 21.5% using original NESARC algorithms), and these revised prevalence rates were much more consistent with recent epidemiological studies in the U.S. and Great Britain. We also found gender differences in the prevalence rate for most PDs. Comorbidity analyses revealed strong associations between PDs and alcohol dependence, drug dependence, and tobacco dependence. PD diagnoses were also associated with scores on dysfunction and impairment, perceived stress and less social support, lifetime history of suicide attempts, interpersonal difficulties, and problems with legal authorities.

LA English
DT Article; Book Chapter
ID MENTAL-HEALTH; STUDENTS
AB Child psychopathology, adolescent suicide, adolescent violence, juvenile arson, juvenile delinquency, and child and adolescent homicide all illustrate a growing spectrum of problems demonstrated by children and adolescents. In point of fact, Duchnowski, Kutash, & Friedman (2002) note in the United States 10% of adolescents have severe to moderate mental health needs, but not all children in need of psychological services actually receive services. Broadly speaking, although potentially dangerous behavioral, adjustment, and psychological disorders are widespread in children and youth, many youth do not receive assistance, and a growing number of children have been placed in highly secure programs ranging from psychiatric hospitals to maximum security prisons. Fortunately, many programs provide a blend of mental health and educational services. Within this context, a number of school psychologists have accepted employment within these settings, often providing classically traditional school psychological services, albeit within very nontraditional settings. This chapter considers the issues.

AB The adolescent with same-sex attraction in the twenty-first century straddles ambivalent cultural and religious attitudes regarding gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender (GLBT) issues; rapid technologic advances that provide easy access to information on sex and sex partners; and the clinician's sensitivity about GLBT issues and his or her awareness of how adolescents can use technology for sex-seeking behavior. It is necessary to deconstruct these factors into defined frameworks. Three checklists, the Clinician's Framework Guide Questions for the GLBT Adolescent, Clinician Reaction to GLBT Issues Checklist, and Global GLBT Checklist for Biopsychosocial Risk Factors, may aid the clinician in acquiring an appreciation of the global dynamics between the gay adolescent, the clinician, and the impact of current social realities.

TI Accounting for taste American collectors and twelfth-century French
   sculpture
SO JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF COLLECTIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB A taste for the Middle Ages had existed in the United States since at least the mid-nineteenth century, when architectural revivalism contributed to its popularity. Yet art collectors - with a few notable exceptions showed little interest in the authentic works of the period. In the early decades of the twentieth century, however, significant sculptures of the twelfth century entered American private and public collections. A seemingly sudden enthusiasm for large-scale sculpture drew progressively more works to the market. Several examples demonstrate well the new lengths to which American collector would go. Particular attention is given here to sculptures originating from Parthenay in southwestern France, whose entrance to the market brought claims of forgery, theft, suicide, and even murder. It seems that Parthenay's sculptures, like others purchased by other collectors and museums, appealed to a romanticized conception of the High Middle Ages that took its cue from an imagined noble, aristocratic type.

AB Alcohol is the substance most frequently abused by children and adolescents in the United States, and its use is associated with the leading causes of death and serious injury at this age (ie, motor vehicle accidents, homicides, and suicides). Among youth who drink, the proportion who drink heavily is higher than among adult drinkers, increasing from approximately 50% in those 12 to 14 years of age to 72% among those 18 to 20 years of age. In this clinical report, the definition, epidemiology, and risk factors for binge drinking; the neurobiology of intoxication, blackouts, and hangovers; genetic considerations; and adverse outcomes are discussed. The report offers guidance for the pediatrician. As with any high-risk behavior, prevention plays a more important role than later intervention and has been shown to be more effective. In the pediatric office setting, it is important to ask every adolescent about alcohol use.

ID TRANSRACIAL ADOPTION; INDIAN ADOLESCENTS; SUICIDE
AB Native American children in the United States have been adopted by non-Indian families at rates that threaten the preservation of their Indian history, traditions, and culture. The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), which established restrictive parameters that govern the placement of Native American children into foster care and adoptive homes, was ratified in an effort to keep American Indian families intact. This article addresses matters of importance to psychiatrists who conduct custody evaluations of Native American children and families. A summary of events that preceded enactment of the ICWA is given, along with guidelines for forensic psychiatrists who conduct foster and adoptive care evaluations of Native American children. We use clinical vignettes to illustrate how the ICWA informs the custody evaluation process as well as approaches to cultural concerns, including biases that forensic evaluators may encounter during these evaluations.

Unfortunately, many, young people do not receive the mental health care they require and may consequently enter the justice system. Studies of incarcerated youths show that up to 70% of them have mental disorders. Many of these youth receive primarily custodial care. A variety of social, legal and medical interventions can and should be implemented to ensure that young people Suffering from mental disorders do not inappropriately enter the justice system due to lack of access to health care and other services.

AB Population health tends to be better in societies where income is more equally distributed. Recent evidence suggests that many other social problems, including mental illness, violence, imprisonment, lack of trust, teenage births, obesity, drug abuse, and poor educational performance of schoolchildren, are also more common in more unequal societies. Differences in the prevalence of ill health and social problems between more and less equal societies seem to be large and to extend to the vast majority of the population. Rather than referencing all the literature, this paper attempts to show which interpretations of these relationships are consistent with the research evidence. After discussing their more important and illuminating characteristics, we conclude that these relationships are likely to reflect a sensitivity of health and social problems to the scale of social stratification and status competition, underpinned by societal differences in material inequality.

AB This review presents a national health profile of adolescents and young adults (ages 10-24). The data presented include trends on demographics, mortality, health-related behaviors, and healthcare access and utilization, as well as the most significant gender and racial/ethnic disparities. Although the data show some improvement, many concerns remain. Encouraging trends-such as decreases in rates of homicide, suicide, and some measures of reproductive health-appear to be leveling off or, in some cases, reversing (e.g., birth and gonorrhea rates). Large disparities, particularly by race/ethnicity and gender, persist in many areas. Access to quality healthcare services remains a challenge, especially during young adulthood. Policy and research recommendations to improve health during these critical periods in the lifespan are outlined. (c) 2009 Society for Adolescent Medicine. All rights reserved.

DT Article
ID ASSISTED SUICIDE; SPIRITUAL CARE; EUTHANASIA; EDUCATION; CRITERIA;
   QUALITY; DEATH
AB In the United States, physician aid in dying (PAD) is now legal in several states. However, neither a requirement for a palliative care (PC) consultation nor a defined education in PC exists for physicians participating in PAD or patients requesting assistance. Patients with advanced chronic and serious illness often experience complex physical, psychosocial, and spiritual distress. PC focuses on relieving this distress and improving patient quality of life through early identification and intervention in all domains of suffering, including physical, psychological, social, and spiritual. Ideally, we would recommend a PC consult, but unfortunately, PC is not readily available or offered at this time to all those who might benefit from it. We present a case for providing an educational handout to patients who inquire about PAD. This handout explains the potential benefits of PC as an additional procedural safeguard to existing regulations. Such information would help to ensure the integrity of the informed consent process, enhance shared decision making, and improve patient comprehension of the options.

AB One in five public school students is from an immigrant-headed household. We used Youth Risk Behavior Survey data from one state and four large urban school districts to examine whether length of time living in the US was associated with health risk behaviors. Logistic regression models, using weighted data, controlled for sex, race/ethnicity, and grade. Compared to US natives, not having always lived in the US was correlated with lower risk for some behaviors (e.g., current marijuana use and alcohol use) among high school students, but higher risk for other behaviors (e.g., attempted suicide, physical inactivity). Many findings were inconsistent across the study sites. Interventions that specifically target recently-arrived school-aged youth to prevent behaviors that put health and safety at risk, may result in the best outcomes for immigrant youth. Care should be taken to understand the specific health risks present in different immigrant communities.

AB Following his discovery of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in football players in 2002, Dr. Bennet Omalu hypothesized that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in military veterans may belong to the CTE spectrum of diseases. The CTE surveillance at the Brain Injury Research Institute was therefore expanded to include deceased military veterans diagnosed with PTSD. The authors report the case of a 27-year-old United States Marine Corps (USMC) Iraqi war veteran, an amphibious assault vehicle crewman, who committed suicide by hanging after two deployments to Fallujah and Ramadi. He experienced combat and was exposed to mortar blasts and improvised explosive device blasts less than 50 m away. Following his second deployment he developed a progressive history of cognitive impairment, impaired memory, behavioral and mood disorders, and alcohol abuse. Neuropsychiatric assessment revealed a diagnosis of PTSD with hyperarousal (irritability and insomnia) and numbing. He committed suicide approximately 8 months after his honorable discharge from the USMC. His brain at autopsy appeared grossly unremarkable except for congestive brain swelling. There was no atrophy or remote focal traumatic brain injury such as contusional necrosis or hemorrhage. Histochemical and immunohistochemical brain tissue analysis revealed CTE changes comprising multifocal, neocortical, and subcortical neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic threads (ranging from none, to sparse, to frequent) with the skip phenomenon, accentuated in the depths of sulci and in the frontal cortex. The subcortical white matter showed mild rarefaction, sparse perivascular and neuropil infiltration by histiocytes, and mild fibrillary astrogliosis. Apolipoprotein E genotype was 3/4. The authors report this case as a sentinel case of CTE in an Iraqi war veteran diagnosed with PTSD to possibly stimulate new lines of thought and research in the possible pathoetiology and pathogenesis of PTSD in military veterans as part of the CTE spectrum of diseases, and as chronic sequelae and outcomes of repetitive traumatic brain injuries.

AB Community social organisation brings individuals together, providing opportunities for collective responses to perceived neighbourhood issues and concerns. This paper considers how rates of neighbourhood mortality influence levels of community organisation. Certain types of mortality may actually enhance, not disrupt, the level of social organisation. Because urban neighbourhoods experience dramatically different mortality rates, the paper examines whether the relationship between mortality and community social organisation varies based on the causes of death and the ages of those dying. Analyses from Chicago neighbourhoods suggest that the rate at which children die from preventable causes such as homicide, suicide and accidents results in an increased likelihood that residents join neighbourhood watch organisations and participate in actions to address community problems. The effect of youth mortality is shaped in part by dense network exchanges among residents.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to highlight the stressors involved in an occupation at potential risk - the profession of law enforcement.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper reviews the history of police stress studies. It describes prevention and treatment programs that have unfortunately not been sufficiently utilized because of the police culture.
   Findings - The documented symptoms of stress include digestive orders, cardiovascular diseas, alcoholism, domestic violence, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and suicide. While some police officers start their careers in excellent physical health, some retire early or even die from job-related stress disorders if the cumulative impact of stress exacts its toll.
   Originality/value - The paper offers a description of COP.2.COP a confidential hotline for officers and their families staffed by retired officers and licensed professionals.

AB We present several rigorous methods for sampling difficult-to-reach and empirically under-represented populations via the Internet. The methodology's representativeness was tested by comparing the demographics of a small sample of 82 lesbian and bisexual females with a much larger Gallup Organization sample of the general population (n > 1,000) obtained via random digit dialing. Compared to the latter poll, the rigorous sampling designs developed for the Internet were found to be significantly more robust and equally representative of the U.S. general population. The Gallup Organization reached a sample more representative of the age distribution of the United States. The Internet sample reached a sample more representative of the population, with less education, lower incomes, and a broad spectrum of ethnic diversity. The samples were equally effective in representing the distribution of the population with rural and urban residence.

AB The aim of this paper was to review current end of life (EOL) practice in Italy. The authors have made an appraisal of the existing literature in order to understand current end aide care practice in Italy. This manuscript focuses on analyzing the dying process, the transoceanic similarities and differences in the end of life decision-making practice, and the Family involvement. The authors acknowledge the importance of the recent Englaro court case verdict on current practice in Italy. Dying has changed as a process over the last century in term of causes of death, costs, communication of the prognosis, and needs of the patient's family. Regardless of national and international guidelines, there is no agreement among Italian doctors regarding the gold standards of daily clinical practice at the EOL. (Minerva Anestesiol 2010;76;203-8)

AB Current rates of intimate partner homicide of females are approximately 4 to 5 times the rate for male victims, although the rates for both have decreased during the past 25 years. The major risk factor for intimate partner homicide, no matter if a female or male partner is killed, is prior domestic violence. This review presents and critiques the evidence supporting the other major risk factors for intimate partner homicide in general, and for intimate partner homicide of women (femicide) in particular, namely guns, estrangement, stepchild in the home,forced sex, threats to kill, and nonfatal strangulation (choking). The demographic risk factors are also examined and the related phenomena of pregnancy-related homicide, attempted femicide, and intimate partner homicide-suicide.

AB Previous studies have shown elevated mortality among psychiatric and substance abusing patients, including veterans with PTSD. Although early studies showed elevated deaths from external causes among Vietnam veterans in the early postwar years, more recent studies have also shown increased health problems among veterans with PTSD. This study compared mortality due to behavioral causes versus other diseases among 1,866 male veterans treated for PTSD. Death certificates obtained for 110 veterans indicated behavioral causes accounted for 62.4% of deaths, standardized mortality ratio D 3.4-5.5, including accidents (29.4%), chronic substance abuse (14.7%), and intentional death by suicide, homicide, or police (13.8%). Results suggest possible opportunities to improve outcomes of this at-risk patient population through harm reduction interventions and improved continuity of care.

AB Cross-national research on the relationship between alcohol consumption and homicide focuses on (a) the amount of alcohol consumed rather than the manner of consumption and (b) the direct relationship between alcohol consumption and homicide rates. The current study addresses these limitations by considering consumption patterns rather than consumption levels and exploring whether the alcohol-homicide relationship is moderated by features of the social structure including youth population size, quality of governance, and the prevalence of drinking. Using a broad sample of 85 countries, we find no relationship between consumption levels and homicide rates. In contrast, hazardous consumption patterns were positively associated with homicide rates. Study results also suggest that the prevalence of drinking and the quality of governance moderate this relationship.

AB Ketamine is known within the medical field for its anesthetic properties, yet its unique psychedelic and antidepressant properties are being increasingly recognized. We document the case of a patient with bipolar I disorder and an extensive history of substance dependence who used large doses of ketamine (1-3g) on a daily basis over a period of 5 years, and described acute antidepressant effects as well as diminished cravings for alcohol. While his use was untenable and ultimately led to an inpatient admission, it is notable that he did not experience a withdrawal syndrome nor did he have any observable cognitive deficits upon cessation of use. Such a unique drug profile suggests that further exploration of its risks and therapeutic potential in treating mood and addiction disorders is warranted. (Am J Addict 2015;24:7-9)

AB A better understanding of rail trespass crashes is needed as more than 400 trespassing related fatalities occur along rail tracks each year in the United States (U.S.). The objective of this research was to investigate factors associated with the occurrence of rail trespass crashes. Yearly crash frequency for counties in the U.S. with train tracks was modeled using a Mixed-effects Negative Binomial Model based on 2012-2016 datasets from the Federal Railroad Administration, the U.S. Census Bureau and National Historical Geographic Information System. Results revealed that key factors affecting rail trespassing crashes include county population density, length of rail tracks in a county, median age and male proportion of the county population, and average train traffic within a county. The findings provided useful information on improving public safety along railroad tracks.

AB Femicide is the intentional killing of a woman because she is female, and often occurs when there are pre-existing relations, intimate or otherwise, between the victim and the murderer.
   A retrospective epidemiological study was made of 34 female homicides recorded in a university departmental register of post-mortems, pertaining to a judicial district of about 700,000 inhabitants in north eastern Italy, during a 21-year period from January 1st 1993 to December 31st 2013.
   The temporal trend, the socio-demographic characteristics of victims and perpetrators, the circumstances surrounding the crime and the risk factors for femicide were studied with the aim of identifying and developing preventive strategies.

AB This paper investigates the association between legal access to firearms in the community through licensed dealers and homicides perpetrated by intimate partners (IPH). We conducted a series of multilevel negative binomial models to assess the relationship between the rate of county-level federally licensed firearm dealers and intimate partner homicides, by gender and age, controlling for leading macro-level correlates of IPH. The rate of county-level federally licensed firearm dealers is significantly associated with intimate partner homicides in urban counties, regardless of gender and age. Although data cannot discern that the rate of licensed firearm dealers is linked to greater legal firearm access, our findings focus attention on the role of community factors, including gun stores, as significant risk factors for violence. Policies to reduce legal options to purchase firearms, especially for those with prior domestic violence offenses, may help to decrease intimate partner homicide, but better data tracking is needed to help us understand how guns move from purchase into the hands of IPH perpetrators.

AB A standard narrative is that nonviolence failed in Kosovo: the Milosevic regime was ended by a NATO bombing campaign. This essay exposes errors in this narrative. Kosovo's nonviolent resistance successfully unified the masses against the regime with a distinctive innovation of building solidarity by reducing violence. In particular, it reduced murders in blood feuds. Kosovo emerged from war with comparatively low violence for a post-conflict society burdened with organized crime. We contrast Kosovo with societies where more people were killed by criminal violence after peace agreements than in wartime. Reconciling blood feuds as part of Kosovo's nonviolent campaign for freedom contributed to this accomplishment. Nonviolent resistance campaigns can be evaluated through a criminological lens whereby averting war is just one means to reducing death rates from intentional violence.

AB This chapter describes a study with the objective to examine cyber aggression involvement among emerging adults across technologies and relationships. Another purpose was to investigate the bidirectional associations between emerging adults' cyber aggression involvement and adjustment difficulties over four years. Participants were 1,483 emerging adults (Mage = 24.67; 60% female) from Southeastern universities in the United States. Emerging adults completed questionnaires on their cyber aggression involvement and adjustment difficulties. The most frequently utilized digital technologies and tool to harm others were text messages. Ex-friends were frequently involved in cyber aggression. Cyber aggression involvement predicted all adjustment difficulties across four years and all adjustment difficulties predicted cyber aggression involvement, suggesting bidirectional relationships among these variables. There were magnitude differences such that the bidirectional relationships were stronger when predicting all adjustment difficulties from cyber aggression and cyber victimization.

AB This study assessed predictors and changes in adequacy of help received (AHR), as perceived by 204 individuals with severe mental disorders (SMDs) transferred from a mental health institution to the community following a key healthcare reform. Adjusted perceived AHR remained stable after 2 years (T1), but decreased at 5-year follow-up (T2). Predictors of higher adjusted perceived AHR are age, severity of needs, help received from services and relatives, and number of health professionals consulted. Community mental health services need to address the two major predictors of adjusted perceived AHR: severity of needs among individuals with SMDs and level of help from services.

AB There is great interest in the dissemination and implementation of evidence-based treatments and practices for children across schools and community mental health settings. A growing body of literature suggests that the use of one-time workshops as a training tool is ineffective in influencing therapist behavior and patient outcomes and that ongoing expert consultation and coaching is critical to actual uptake and quality implementation. Yet, we have very limited understanding of how expert consultation fits into the larger implementation support system, or the most effective consultation strategies. This commentary reviews the literature on consultation in child mental health, and proposes a set of core consultation functions, processes, and outcomes that should be further studied in the implementation of evidence-based practices for children.

AB The number of women serving in the military and deployed to active-duty is unprecedented in the history of the United States. When women became a permanent sector of the U.S. Armed Services in 1948, their involvement was restricted to comprise only 2% of the military population; today women constitute approximately 14.5% of the 1.4 million active component and 18% of the 850,000 reserve component. Yet, little attention has been paid to the mental health needs of women military members. This review article highlights the history of women in the military and then focuses on the impact of combat exposure and injuries, military sexual trauma, alcohol use, and family separations which are associated with PTSD, depression, suicide, difficulty with reintegration, and homelessness.

AB Are there gender-specific risk factors for suicidal activity among patients with schizophrenia and depression? A total of 74 schizophrenia patients (51 men, 23 women) and 77 unipolar nonpsychotic depressed patients (26 men, 51 women) from the Chicago Follow-up Study were studied prospectively at 2 years posthospitalization and again at 7.5 years. Poor early posthospital global functioning is significantly associated with later suicidal activity only for men in both our schizophrenia and depressive samples. Early display of psychotic symptoms is associated with later suicidal activity among male schizophrenia patients. Early cognitive impairment is not significantly associated with later suicidal activity for any of the four groups of patients. The study results must be seen as exploratory and will hopefully spur future research on this important topic.

AB Background: Relatively little is known about the relationship between psychosocial crises and treatment costs for persons with schizophrenia. This naturalistic prospective study assessed the association of recent crises with mental health treatment costs among persons receiving treatment for schizophrenia.
   Methods: Data were drawn from a large multi-site, non-interventional study of schizophrenia patients in the United States, conducted between 1997 and 2003. Participants were treated at mental health treatment systems, including the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals, community mental health centers, community and state hospitals, and university health care service systems. Total costs over a 1-year period for mental health services and component costs (psychiatric hospitalizations, antipsychotic medications, other psychotropic medications, day treatment, emergency psychiatric services, psychosocial/rehabilitation group therapy, individual therapy, medication management, and case management) were calculated for 1557 patients with complete medical information. Direct mental health treatment costs for patients who had experienced 1 or more of 5 recent crisis events were compared to propensity-matched samples of persons who had not experienced a crisis event. The 5 non-mutually exclusive crisis event subgroups were: suicide attempt in the past 4 weeks (n = 18), psychiatric hospitalization in the past 6 months (n = 240), arrest in the past 6 months (n = 56), violent behaviors in the past 4 weeks (n = 62), and diagnosis of a co-occurring substance use disorder (n = 413).
   Results: Across all 5 categories of crisis events, patients who had a recent crisis had higher average annual mental health treatment costs than patients in propensity-score matched comparison samples. Average annual mental health treatment costs were significantly higher for persons who attempted suicide ($46,024), followed by persons with psychiatric hospitalization in the past 6 months ($37,329), persons with prior arrests ($31,081), and persons with violent behaviors ($18,778). Total cost was not significantly higher for those with co-occurring substance use disorder ($19,034).
   Conclusion: Recent crises, particularly suicide attempts, psychiatric hospitalizations, and criminal arrests, are predictive of higher mental health treatment costs in schizophrenia patients.

AB In the United States there were some 1,775 jails with one hundred beds or less, but there had been little empirical examination of these facilities, or the challenges that they confront. This survey of 213 jail administrators from these small facilities found that under-funding, overcrowding, and retention and recruitment of officers were the most significant challenges. By contrast, suicide and violence were perceived to be less serious problems. The small jails sampled also held relatively high percentages of special needs inmates, and this places further demands on these agencies. These challenges are very similar to problems identified several decades ago, suggesting that few structural or operational changes had been made in rural justice systems. In many places, rural jails acted as a default mechanism for failures in other social, health, or community systems and they become the place that "just can't say no." (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: The growing proportion of elderly implies that natural and unnatural deaths of the elderly will be increasingly confronted. The objective of our study was to determine the unnatural manner and causes of death in the elderly, defined as individuals at least 65 years of age at the time of death. We conducted a monocentric restrospective study based on police investigation reports and medicolegal autopsy reports collected from the Department of Legal Medicine of Charles Nicolle Hospital in Tunis, Tunisia between January 1st 2016 and December 31st, 2017.
   Results: During this period, 3837 autopsies were performed. Five hundred ninety-two (15.4%) were 65 years or older at the time of death. Of these, 264 deaths were categorized as accidental, suicidal, homicidal, or unknown. The mean age of victims was 753 years (+/- 6.7), unnatural deaths were higher in urban areas (64%) and victims were living alone in 24.7% of cases. Accidents accounted for the majority of unnatural deaths (90.5%) and were more common in males. Traffic accidents accounted for 66.9% of accidental deaths; they were more frequent in pedestrians and more frequent on Monday. They were followed by accidental falls which accounted for 17.2% of accidents and occurred in the home especially or in the workplace. Charcoal brazier was incriminated in 11 cases of accidental thermal burns and in all cases of accidental carbon monoxide poisoning. Suicide and homicide were uncommon manners of death; they were observed in 16 and eight cases respectively. Hanging was the most used suicidal mean. Suicides were more common in males; they took place especially in the victim's home, and history of psychiatric disorders was frequently elicited.
   Conclusions: Autopsies provide important statistical data that can be used for preventive strategies. For instance, actions must be carried out on the maintenance of public roads and raising awareness among public road users. Preventive measures should also include home improvement to help the elderly avoid accidental falls, installing smoke detectors, and the non-use of defective or rudimentary heating.

AB Amidst increasing focus on rising rates of substance abuse and suicide among white Americans and extending prior research on intergroup attitudes and health, this study examines a novel factor associated with psychological distress: disagreement with multiculturalism. Using the Portraits of American Life Study (N = 2,292), logistic regressions indicate that for Whites and Hispanics, increased likelihood of psychological distress (depression, hopelessness and worthlessness) is associated with stronger disagreement with multiculturalism, measured as "If we want to create a society where people get along, we must recognize that each ethnic group has the right to maintain its own unique traditions." For Blacks, however, attitudes toward multiculturalism are not associated with psychological distress. Future research might determine if these results can be replicated, and if so, identify the causal mechanism(s) at work.

AB Induced abortion is the most common surgical procedure performed on females of child-bearing age, including adolescent women. Consequently, pediatricians should be familiar with the short-term and long-term risks of induced abortion and also be able to compassionately discuss these risks with adolescents and involved family members. Some of the potential short- and long-term risks include increased mortality from suicide and other violence, as well as natural causes; increased risk of breast cancer; greater rates of substance abuse; and higher risk of morbidity and mortality for subsequent children due to premature births, especially very premature births. Patient education on the risks of induced abortion should be considered during anticipatory guidance discussions at well-child visits during the adolescent years.

AB This study examined the mediating roles of several family variables in the relation between IPV witnessing and children's emotional and behavioral problems among 129 low-income, African American children ages 8 to 12. According to the mediational model tested, experiencing or witnessing IPV negatively impacted the following family variables: maternal psychopathology, family cohesion, and relatedness quality, which were subsequently associated with diminished child adjustment. These findings were stronger when child reports were considered and when the outcome variable was internalizing problems. Findings from this study support the value of targeting these variables in the development of culturally appropriate child witness interventions for low-income African American families. Recommendations for future interventions based on study conclusions are offered.

DE uxoricide; spousal murder; wife killing; homicide; Ghana
ID SPOUSAL HOMICIDES; UNITED-STATES; VIOLENCE; PATTERNS; WOMEN
AB This article addresses the current lack of research on uxoricides in non-Western societies by examining the phenomenon in Ghana, West Africa. Analysis of data from the 60 husband-wife killings reported in a national daily newspaper reveals that jealousy and suspicion of infidelity overwhelmingly provided the basis for wife murders. The findings also indicate that assailants and victims were of low socioeconomic background and the murders predominantly occurred in the rural areas of the country. Posthomicidal suicide by the assailant occurred in about one fourth of the cases. Overall, the results demonstrate that the patterns of uxoricide in Ghana are congruous in many significant ways with those noted in Western industrialized societies. It is concluded that additional research in non-Western societies is warranted to contribute to the development of sound conclusions about and remedies for uxoricide.

DE Peer review; License; Misconduct; Fitness for duty
ID SUICIDE; IMPACT; DOCTORS
AB In the United States, oversight of health care practitioners is delegated to a matrix of health care entities including but not limited to the state medical board which licenses physicians in the relevant jurisdiction.
   Typically, these organizations have their own codes of professional conduct. When a physician joins one of these health care organizations, legally the physician has entered into a contract with the organization and agreed to be bound by its regulations and procedures.
   The organization's peer review of a member physician for reasons of investigating questions of health care quality may require a psychiatric fitness for duty evaluation. That assessment is a forensic psychiatric examination to assist the peer review body much as an expert witness would assist the trier of fact in a criminal or civil law adjudication. Experts can better perform these functions if they are familiar with the legal differences that define these agencies' service under administrative as compared to civil or criminal law and procedures.

AB The social environment in which lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) youths live influences health and well-being. We describe the development of the LGBTQ Supportive Environments Inventory (LGBTQ SEI), designed to quantify the LGBTQ-inclusiveness of social environments in the United States and Canada. We quantify aspects of the social environment including: (1) presence/quality of LGBTQ youth-serving organizations; (2) LGBTQ-inclusive community resources; and (3) socioeconomic and political environment. Using geographic information systems (GIS) tools, we aggregated data to buffers around 397 schools in three regions. The LGBTQ SEI can be used to assess the role of the social environment in reducing health disparities for LGBTQ youths.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to examine mental health conditions among hospitalized individuals with Parkinson's disease in the United States.
   Methods: This was a serial cross-sectional study of hospitalizations of individuals aged >= 60 identified in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample dataset from 2000 to 2010. We identified all hospitalizations with a diagnosis of PD, alcohol abuse, anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, impulse control disorders, mania, psychosis, substance abuse, and attempted suicide/suicidal ideation. National estimates of each mental health condition were compared between hospitalized individuals with and without PD. Hierarchical logistic regression models determined which inpatient mental health diagnoses were associated with PD, adjusting for demographic, payer, geographic, and hospital characteristics.
   Results: We identified 3,918,703 mental health and substance abuse hospitalizations. Of these, 2.8% (n=104, 437) involved a person also diagnosed with PD. The majority of mental health and substance abuse patients were white (86.9% of PD vs 83.3% of non-PD). Women were more common than men in both groups (male: female prevalence ratio, PD: 0.78, 0.78-0.79, non-PD: 0.58, 0.57-0.58). Depression (adjusted odds ratio 1.32, 1.31-1.34), psychosis (adjusted odds ratio 1.25, 1.15-1.33), bipolar disorder (adjusted odds ratio 2.74, 2.69-2.79), impulse control disorders (adjusted odds ratio 1.51, 1.31-1.75), and mania (adjusted odds ratio 1.43, 1.18-1.74) were more likely among PD patients, alcohol abuse was less likely (adjusted odds ratio 0.26, 0.25-0.27). We found no PD-associated difference in suicide-related care.
   Conclusions: PD patients have unique patterns of acute care for mental health and substance abuse. Research is needed to guide PD treatment in individuals with pre-existing psychiatric illnesses, determine cross provider reliability of psychiatric diagnoses in PD patients, and inform efforts to improve psychiatric outcomes.

AB The study examined a representative sample of the 1,060,000 individuals discharged from drug user treatment in the United States in the 12 months before September 1990, and compared self-reports of behavior 5 years before to 5 years after treatment: Self-reports about recent drug use were compared with urine samples, and the agreement between self-report and drug-test results was high. The key findings are that the number of alcohol and drug users declined markedly, ranging from one-seventh to more than one half; those who continued using drugs after treatment used them less frequently than before treatment; criminal behavior fell between one-quarter to one-half,rand primary criminal support fell by one third; full-time employment did not change; homelessness, drug injection, and suicide attempts decreased by more than one-third.

AB Aim. This study aimed at evaluating depression and suicidal ideation and coping strategies with stress in patients receiving haemodialysis replacement therapy.
   Background. Patients undergoing haemodialysis treatment may often experience depression and accompanying suicidal ideation. Coping strategies with depression-related suicidal ideation may require regular evaluation of the patient and the support of nurses.
   Design. A cross-sectional descriptive study.
   Method. The sample consisted of 92 adults with an age range of 19-65 who had chronic renal failure and consecutively admitted to the Dialysis Center of Kadikoy and Dialysis Center of Kahraman in Turkey. Four instruments were used: Socio-demographic Form, Beck Depression Inventory, Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire and Coping Strategies with Stress Inventory.
   Results. The points obtained from Beck Depression Inventory were above 17 (the cut-off point) in 40.2% of the patients. There were positive correlations between depression and Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire (r = 0.469, p = 0.001), between patients' age and depression (r = 0.43, p = 0.00) and suicidal ideation (r = 0.27, p = 0.01). Depression and behavioural disengagement had a positive correlation (p = 0.001, r = 0.410). Depression and suicidal ideation increased with lower education status (F = 7.42, p = 0.001; F = 4.51, p = 0.014).
   Conclusion. Haemodialysis patients frequently experience depression. This study demonstrated that suicidal ideation increased as the severity of depression increased. Depression and suicidal ideation were increasing with age in patients with chronic renal failure. Therefore, it is considered necessary for dialysis patients to be under regular psychiatric evaluation with risk assessment.
   Relevance to clinical practice. It is vitally important that nurses in dialysis centres evaluate the psychosocial conditions of patients with renal failure undergoing haemodialysis treatment so as to enhance the quality of nursing care. It is also fundamental for the success of holistic care that nurses properly assess the possibility of depression and suicide as well as coping strategies. This study sheds light on the holistic evaluations of dialysis patients.

AB Objective: To identify factors associated with psychiatric hospitalization among adolescents with bipolar disorder (BD).
   Methods: Participants were 100 adolescents, ages 13-19, who fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for bipolar I disorder [(BD-I), n = 26], bipolar II disorder [(BD-II), n = 40], or operationalized criteria for BD not otherwise specified [(BD-NOS), n = 34], via the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, Present and Lifetime version (KSADS-PL). Demographic, clinical, and family history variables were measured via clinical interview with the participant and a parent or guardian.
   Results: The lifetime prevalence of psychiatric hospitalization was 50%. Significant predictors of psychiatric hospitalization in univariate analyses included older age, BD-I, history of suicide attempt, psychosis, lifetime use of second generation antipsychotics (SGAs), lithium, SSRI antidepressants and any medication. BD-II was negatively associated with psychiatric hospitalization. In multivariable analyses, older age, history of suicide attempt, psychosis and use of SGAs were positively associated with hospitalization, whereas BD-II was negatively associated with hospitalization.
   Conclusions: Psychiatric hospitalization in adolescents with BD is highly prevalent and associated with older age and proxies for greater illness severity. Further studies are needed to identify strategies for reducing the need for psychiatric hospitalizations among adolescents with BD. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of our study was to examine the nationwide trends in the age- and sex-specific incidence rates of fatal injuries among 10-19-year-old adolescents in Finland, a country with a welt-defined white population of 5.2 million. A population- based study was based on Official Cause-of-Death Statistics of Finland. We included adolescents aged 10-19 years who died because of an injury in 1971-2002. During the study period, the incidence of injury-related deaths declined considerably, from 43.0 (per 100,000 persons) (95% confidence interval (0): 38.5, 47.5) in 1971 to 19.9 (95% CI: 16.5, 23.4) in 2002 (p < 0.001). The decrease was seen in both genders. The decline in injury deaths was mainly due to decrease of deaths in traffic accidents. A sharp peak in boys' suicides was found during economic depression. To sum up, the incidence of adolescent injury deaths declined considerably in Finland between 1971 and 2002. The reasons for this positive development are probably multifactorial, including improvements in traffic safety and emergency services. The trend in intentional deaths showed no change during the 32-year study period and therefore prevention of adolescent violence and suicides should also receive attention. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Firearm Ownership and Domestic Versus Nondomestic Homicide in the US

ID INTIMATE PARTNER HOMICIDE; GUN OWNERSHIP; SUICIDE RATES; UNITED-STATES;
   VIOLENCE
AB Introduction: Gun ownership is associated with firearm mortality, although this association differs across victim-offender relationships. This study examines the relationship between gun ownership and domestic versus nondomestic homicide rates by victim sex.
   Methods: Several sources of state-level panel data from 1990 through 2016 were merged from each of the 50 states to model domestic (i.e., family and intimate partners) and nondomestic firearm homicide as a function of state-level household firearm ownership. Firearm ownership was examined using a validated proxy measure and homicide rates came from the Supplemental Homicide Reports of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports. Negative binomial regression with fixed effects was used to model the outcomes and employed generalized estimating equations to account for clustering within states. Statistical analyses were completed in 2018.
   Results: State-level firearm ownership was uniquely associated with domestic (incidence rate ratio=1.013, 95% CI=1.008, 1.018) but not nondomestic (incidence rate ratio=1.002, 95% CI=0.996, 1.008) firearm homicide rates, and this pattern held for both male and female victims. States in the top quartile of firearm ownership had a 64.6% (p<0.001) higher incidence rate of domestic firearm homicide than states in the lowest quartile; however, states in the top quartile did not differ significantly from states in the lowest quartile of firearm ownership in observed incidence rates of nondomestic firearm homicide.
   Conclusions: State-level firearm ownership rates are related to rates of domestic but not nondomestic firearm homicide. (C) 2019 American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The current article deals with the ethics and practice of physician-assisted suicide (PAS) and dying. The debate about PAS must take the important legal and ethical context of medical acts at the end of life into consideration, and cannot be examined independently from physicians' duties with respect to care for the terminally ill and dying. The discussion in Germany about active euthanasia, limiting medical intervention at the end of life, patient autonomy, advanced directives, and PAS is not fundamentally different in content and arguments from discussions led in other European countries and the United States. This must be emphasized, since it is occasionally claimed that in Germany a thorough discussion could not be held with the same openness as in other countries due to Germany's recent history. Still, it is worthwhile to portray the debate, which has been held intensively both among experts and the German public, from the German perspective. In general, it can be stated that in Germany debates about questions of medical ethics and bioethics are taking place with relatively large participation of an interested public, as shown, for instance, by the intense recent discussions about the legalisation of advanced directives on June 18 2009, the generation and use of embryonic stem cells in research or the highly difficult challenges for the prioritizing and rationing of scarce resources within the German health care system. Hence, the current article provides some insights into central medical and legal documents and the controversial public debate on the regulation of end-of-life medical care. In conclusion, euthanasia and PAS as practices of direct medical killing or medically assisted killing of vulnerable persons as "due care" is to be strictly rejected. Instead, we propose a more holistically-oriented palliative concept of a compassionate and virtuous doctor-cared dying that is embedded in an ethics of care.

AB ImportanceUS life expectancy has not kept pace with that of other wealthy countries and is now decreasing. ObjectiveTo examine vital statistics and review the history of changes in US life expectancy and increasing mortality rates; and to identify potential contributing factors, drawing insights from current literature and an analysis of state-level trends. EvidenceLife expectancy data for 1959-2016 and cause-specific mortality rates for 1999-2017 were obtained from the US Mortality Database and CDC WONDER, respectively. The analysis focused on midlife deaths (ages 25-64 years), stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geography (including the 50 states). Published research from January 1990 through August 2019 that examined relevant mortality trends and potential contributory factors was examined. FindingsBetween 1959 and 2016, US life expectancy increased from 69.9 years to 78.9 years but declined for 3 consecutive years after 2014. The recent decrease in US life expectancy culminated a period of increasing cause-specific mortality among adults aged 25 to 64 years that began in the 1990s, ultimately producing an increase in all-cause mortality that began in 2010. During 2010-2017, midlife all-cause mortality rates increased from 328.5 deaths/100000 to 348.2 deaths/100000. By 2014, midlife mortality was increasing across all racial groups, caused by drug overdoses, alcohol abuse, suicides, and a diverse list of organ system diseases. The largest relative increases in midlife mortality rates occurred in New England (New Hampshire, 23.3%; Maine, 20.7%; Vermont, 19.9%) and the Ohio Valley (West Virginia, 23.0%; Ohio, 21.6%; Indiana, 14.8%; Kentucky, 14.7%). The increase in midlife mortality during 2010-2017 was associated with an estimated 33307 excess US deaths, 32.8% of which occurred in 4 Ohio Valley states. Conclusions and RelevanceUS life expectancy increased for most of the past 60 years, but the rate of increase slowed over time and life expectancy decreased after 2014. A major contributor has been an increase in mortality from specific causes (eg, drug overdoses, suicides, organ system diseases) among young and middle-aged adults of all racial groups, with an onset as early as the 1990s and with the largest relative increases occurring in the Ohio Valley and New England. The implications for public health and the economy are substantial, making it vital to understand the underlying causes.
   This population epidemiology study uses data from the National Center for Health Statistics and the US Mortality Database to assess changes and state-level trends in US life expectancy and mortality rates from 1959 to 2017, and to identify potential contributing factors.

AB Antisocial personality disorder is highly co-morbid with other mental disorders, particularly substance use disorders, but little is known about the use of mental health services among this group. The study investigated the use of mental health services and associations with psychiatric co-morbidity among persons with a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder within a representative UK household population. Weighted data from 8 395 respondents included 245 (2.9%) with a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder. This diagnosis resulted in independent risks of substance abuse disorders, suicide attempts and generalized anxiety disorders when compared with the general population. Help-seeking behaviour was more prevalent among the antisocial group than the general population but was primarily mediated through co-morbid Axis I mental disorders and was not because of antisocial symptoms or other co-morbid personality disorders. Among those with antisocial personality disorder, approximately one-quarter had consulted a mental health professional in the year before interview. Of those, nearly 70% suffered from a co-morbid anxiety disorder. High use of mental health services among persons with antisocial personality disorder appears to be a characteristic of a specific subgroup with high levels of anxiety.

AB Cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes coronary heart, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular disease, is the leading cause of death in the United States and most developed countries, accounting for about 50% of all deaths. The major risk factors include obesity and its consequences, dyslipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance leading to diabetes, and cigarette smoking. In developing countries, CVD will become the leading cause of death due to alarming increases in obesity, sedentary lifestyles, cigarette smoking, and improvements in prevention and treatment of malnutrition and infection. Compared with nonschizophrenics, patients with schizophrenia have a 20% shorter life expectancy (i.e., from 76 to 61 years). In general populations, about 1% die from suicide compared with about 10% among patients with schizophrenia (relative risk = 10). For CVD, the corresponding figures are 50% and about 75% (relative risk = 1.5). In patients with schizophrenia, however, CVD occurs more frequently and accounts for more premature deaths than suicide. Patients with schizophrenia have alarmingly higher rates of obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, and cigarette smoking than nonschizophrenic individuals in the general population. Compounding these data, patients with schizophrenia have less access to medical care, consume less medical care, and are less compliant. Primary prevention strategies should include the choice of antipsychotic drug regimens that do not adversely affect the major risk factors for CVD.

AB Background and aims In the United States, access to naloxone has been expanded as a measure to address growing opioid overdose mortality. The study aimed to describe the national trends in naloxone use as reported to the US poison centers (PCs). Methods Results The National Poison Data System (NPDS) was queried for cases reporting naloxone therapy from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2016. Demographic and clinical characteristics were assessed descriptively. Trends in naloxone reports were evaluated by using generalized linear mixed models that were adjusted for age, gender and random effects of the geographical census region. Cumulative incidence rates (CIR) of naloxone reports at the state- and national-level were calculated. There were 304 249 cases reporting naloxone therapy during the study period. The frequency of naloxone reports increased from 9498 in 2000 to 26 826 in 2016. The proportion of cases where naloxone was used prior to PC recommendation increased from 59.8% in 2000 to 81.5% in 2016. The mean number of NPDS naloxone reports per 100 000 human exposures increased from 9.6 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 6.4-14.2] to 31.7 (95% CI = 21.4-46.9, P < 0.001). Among the cases, 52.4% were female and the most frequent age group was 20-39 years (39.1%). The principal reason for a toxic exposure resulting in a naloxone report was suspected suicide (55.0%). Life-threatening symptoms were seen in one-fifth of the cases, with 53.9% cases being admitted to critical care units. Opioids (59.7% cases), were the most commonly reported exposure agents, with hydrocodone being most frequently reported. The national CIR of naloxone reports to the US PCs was 6.3 cases per 100 000 population, with West Virginia demonstrating the highest incidence. Conclusions Analysis of calls to the United States poison centers indicates an increasing trend of naloxone use from 2000 to 2016.

   UNITED-STATES; BEHAVIOR; CRIME; ADOLESCENCE; HOMICIDE; SUICIDE
AB It is still unclear if and how biological factors contribute to excess male mortality due to 'external causes' (accidents, injuries, homicides and suicides). Sex hormones and reproductive roles are supposed to drive sex differences in behaviours increasing the male external cause mortality risk. This study analyses the external cause mortality of Catholic nuns and monks from three Bavarian cloisters whose similar environments allow the impact of biological factors to be isolated from a number of confounding causes. Using obituaries, entries in the profession books of religious orders and cemetery registers 2533 deaths of nuns and monks could be linked to a specific cause of death for the years 1946-2005, of which 69 belong to the group of external cause deaths. External cause mortality of the Bavarian cloistered and the West German general Population has been compared by means of standardized mortality rates (SMRs) for ages 45 onwards using the European age standard for the age groups 45-64, 65-74 and 75+. Whereas nuns show statistically significantly lower external cause mortality than the general female population, monks' external cause mortality parallels or even exceeds that of general Population males. These findings contradict the reproductive role hypothesis and provide some evidence for the sex hormones hypothesis.

AB The purpose of this systematic review was to identify the instruments created or adapted to assess non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) among adolescents. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology was used. Two individual reviewers analyzed the psychometric properties of instruments published in English or Spanish from 1990 to 2016 considering standardized quality criteria. The PsycINFO, PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus, SciELO, ScienceDirect, and EBSCO databases were consulted. Eighteen studies that created or adapted 11 instruments were selected. Most were developed in the United States or Canada, and none were developed in Latin America. Several studies presented no evidence of the psychometric properties of their instruments. Seven of the 18 studies obtained at least one positive score. The Alexian Brothers Urge to Self-Injure Scale (ABUSI) and the Impulse, Self-harm, and Suicide Ideation Questionnaire for Adolescents (ISSIQ-A) obtained the highest positive scores. The limitation of this study is that only seven databases were employed for the literature search in English and Spanish. The reporting of the psychometric properties of NSSI instruments among adolescents should be improved, and adaptations to Latin American countries should be developed for international comparisons.

AB Background Globalisation is the process by which traditional boundaries of cultures are changing. Industrialisation, urbanisation and influence of the media are influencing idioms of distress across cultures.
   Aims To discuss the role of globalisation, using the epidemiology, diagnosis, clinical presentation and treatment of depression across various cultures as an example.
   Method Recent studies focusing on transcultural aspects of depression were reviewed and summarised.
   Results Cultural, social and religious mores account for variations in the presentation of depression across cultures. Somatic symptoms are common presenting features throughout the world and may serve as cultural idioms of distress, but psychological symptoms can usually be found when probed. Feelings of guilt and suicide rates vary across cultures and depression may be underdiagnosed.
   Conclusions Training packages could enhance clinicians' cultural competency in multicultural settings. However, globalisation is likely to influence idioms of distress and pathways to care in ways that are difficult to predict.

ID ALCOHOL-USE; TRENDS; MORTALITY; DRINKING
AB Recent research has implicated economic insecurity in increasing midlife death rates and "deaths of despair," including suicide, chronic liver disease, and drug and alcohol poisoning. In this ecological longitudinal study, we evaluated the association between changes in economic insecurity and increases in deaths of despair and midlife all-cause mortality in US counties during 2000-2015. We extended a previously developed measure of economic insecurity using indicators from the Census and Federal Reserve Bank in US counties for the years 2000 and 2010. Linear regression models were used to estimate the association of change in economic insecurity with change in death rates through 2015. Counties experiencing elevated economic insecurity in either 2000 or 2010 had higher rates of deaths of despair and all-cause midlife mortality at baseline but similar rates of increase in deaths of despair from 2001 to 2015 compared with counties with stable low economic insecurity. Counties in the highest tertile of economic insecurity in 2000 and 2010 had 41% (95% confidence interval: 1.36, 1.47) higher midlife mortality rates at baseline and a rate of increase of 2% more per 5-year period (95% confidence interval: 1.00, 1.03) than counties with stable low economic insecurity. Economic insecurity may represent a population-level driver of US death trends.

AB Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States and the second cause of death among those ages 15-24 years. The current standard of care for suicidality management often involves an involuntary hospitalization deemed necessary by the attending psychiatrist. The purpose of this article is to reexamine the ethical tradeoffs inherent in the current practice of involuntary psychiatric hospitalization for suicidal patients, calling attention to the often-neglected harms inherent in this practice and proposing a path for future research. With accumulating evidence of the harms inherent in civil commitment, we propose that the relative value of this intervention needs to be reevaluated and more efficacious alternatives researched. Three arguments are presented: (1) that inadequate attention has been given to the harms resulting from the use of coercion and the loss of autonomy, (2) that inadequate evidence exists that involuntary hospitalization is an effective method to reduce deaths by suicide, and (3) that some suicidal patients may benefit more from therapeutic interventions that maximize and support autonomy and personal responsibility. Considering this evidence, we argue for a policy that limits the coercive hospitalization of suicidal individuals to those who lack decision-making capacity.

AB Many patients with chronic noncancer pain present with comorbid depression, which can greatly complicate the treatment of pain. Chronic pain and depression each increase the risk of licit and illicit substance abuse, including the abuse of opioids, and of suicide. Patients attempting suicide may overdose on opioids, which are commonly perceived as potentially harmful, or acetaminophen, an agent that is believed to be safe but is actually the leading cause of liver failure in the United States. Opioids, acetaminophen, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have the potential to interact with antidepressants, and their adverse effects may be exacerbated by alcohol use, which is also common in patients with depression. Topical NSAIDs, capsaicin, and lidocaine provide effective analgesia for several pain conditions. These agents limit systemic drug exposure, reducing the risk of systemic adverse events without risk of accidental or deliberate overdose. However, use of topical agents is generally limited to localized pain syndromes and therefore does not substantially eliminate the need for systemic analgesics in those patients with diffuse persistent pain, central sensitization, and opioid-responsive pain. This review will discuss the challenges associated with treating chronic pain in depressed patients and will provide recommendations for optimizing treatment.

AB In June 2016, Bill C-14 or Medical Assistance in Dying legislation became law in Canada. With this law came changes to nurses' (ie, nurse practitioner, registered nurse, registered practical nurse) scopes of practice, roles, and responsibilities. While federal law, regulatory, and organizational policies are developed to inform nurses about the practice of medical assistance in dying, there is little evidence examining how nurses' roles and responsibilities are enacted in practice. Therefore, a scoping review was conducted to synthesize the evidence on nurses' roles and responsibilities in relation to medical assistance in dying and to identify gaps in the literature. A secondary aim was to identify organizational supports for nurses to effectively and ethically engage in medical assistance in dying. Using a recognized and rigorous scoping review methodology, the findings from 24 research studies were synthesized in this article. The analysis highlights the importance of effective health care professional engagement with the individual in the decision-making process and of the need to educate, support, and include nurses in providing medical assistance in dying. Overall, the current research on medical assistance in dying is limited in Canada, and more attention is needed on the role of the nurse.

AB Joint Commission National Patient Safety Goal 15 calls for organizations to identify patients at risk for suicide. Overt suicidal behavior accounts for 0.6% of emergency department (ED) visits, but incidental suicidal ideation is found in 3%-11.6%. This is the first multicenter study of suicide screening in EDs. Of 2,243 patients in six diverse emergency settings, 1,068 (47.7%) were screened with a brief instrument. Depression was endorsed by 369 (34.5%); passive suicidal ideation by 79 (7.3%); and active suicidal ideation by 24 (2.3%). One hundred thirty-seven (12.8%) reported prior attempts, including 35 (3.3%) with current suicidal ideation. Almost half of those with current ideation had a prior attempt (43.8%) versus those without current ideation, 10.3%, 2 (1)=75.59, p<.001. Twenty cases (25%) were admitted to medical services, but only 10 (12.5%) received mental health assessment; none were admitted directly to a psychiatry service. The prevalence of suicidal ideation here is similar to previous studies but the frequency of prior attempts has not been reported. The 35 cases with current ideation and prior attempt are at risk. As they did not present psychiatrically, they would likely have gone undetected. Despite reporting these cases to clinical staff, few received risk assessment.

AB Growing evidence suggests that lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults may be at elevated risk for mental health and substance use disorders, possibly due to anti-gay stigma. Little of this work has examined putative excess morbidity among ethnic/racial minorities resulting from the experience of multiple sources of discrimination. The authors report findings from the National Latino and Asian American Survey (NLAAS), a national household probability psychiatric survey of 4,488 Latino and Asian American adults. Approximately 4.8% of persons interviewed identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and/or reported recent same-gender sexual experiences. Although few sexual orientation-related differences were observed, among men, gay/bisexual men were more likely than heterosexual men to report a recent suicide attempt. Among women, lesbian/bisexual women were more likely than heterosexual women to evidence positive 1-year and lifetime histories of depressive disorders. These findings suggest a small elevation in psychiatric morbidity risk among Latino and Asian American individuals with a minority sexual orientation. However, the level of morbidity among sexual orientation minorities in the NLAAS appears similar to or lower than that observed in population-based studies of lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults.

AB The mental health and wellness of veterinary students is an important contemporary focus of scholarship. Yet, to date, little empirical work has investigated mental health experiences and rates of mental health service use in large samples of veterinary students from multiple institutions. The purpose of this study is to explore the prevalence of mental health concerns among veterinary medical students, as well as rates of mental health service utilization, using validated measures and a large sample. Study participants were 573 veterinary medical students currently enrolled in accredited veterinary medical programs in the United States. Approximately one third of participants reported levels of depression or anxiety above the clinical cut-off, and a strong positive correlation was found between the two. Depression and anxiety were also associated with prior engagement in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), suicidal ideation, and prior suicide attempts. Nearly 80% of participants who scored above the clinical cut-off for depression or anxiety reported seeking some form of mental health services currently or in the past, and a majority reported having positive experiences with services. Results also indicated a higher than typical rate of NSSI among veterinary medical students. Implications for outreach, research, and education are discussed.

ID NEONATAL OUTCOMES; WOMEN; PREVALENCE
AB Intimate partner violence is a significant public health problem in our society, affecting women disproportionately. Intimate partner violence takes many forms, including physical violence, sexual violence, stalking, and psychological aggression. While the scope of intimate partner violence is not fully documented, nearly 40% of women in the United States are victims of sexual violence in their lifetimes and 20% are victims of physical intimate partner violence. Other forms of intimate partner violence are likely particularly underreported. Intimate partner violence has a substantial impact on a woman's physical and mental health. Physical disorders include the direct consequences of injuries sustained after physical violence, such as fractures, lacerations and head trauma, sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancies as a consequence of sexual violence, and various pain disorders. Mental health impacts include an increased risk of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and suicide. These adverse health effects are amplified in pregnancy, with an increased risk of pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth, low birthweight, and small for gestational age. In many US localities, suicide and homicide are leading causes of pregnancy-associated mortality. We herein review the issues noted previously in greater depth and introduce the basic principles of intimate partner violence prevention. We separately address current recommendations for intimate partner violence screening and the evidence surrounding effectiveness of intimate partner violence interventions.

AB Death ideation is commonly reported by older adults in the United States; however, the factors contributing to death ideation in older adults are not fully understood. Depressive symptoms, as well as components of the interpersonal theory of suicide, perceived burden, and thwarted belonging may contribute to death ideation.Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the moderating relationship of the psychological symptoms of depression on the relation between perceived burdensomeness and death ideation, and thwarted belongingness and death ideation.Method: A sample of 151 older adults completed questionnaires assessing numerous covariates, as well as perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, death ideation, and the psychological symptoms of depression.Results: The results of this study indicated that the proposed moderating relationship was supported for the relationship between perceived burdensomeness and death ideation, but was not supported for the relationship between thwarted belongingness and death ideation when covariates (loneliness and hopelessness) were controlled.Conclusion: This suggests that the psychological symptoms of depression are significantly associated with death ideation in older adults experiencing feelings of perceived burdensomeness. Additionally, the findings suggest that loneliness and hopelessness are also important factors to consider when assessing death ideation in older adults.

AB Objectives: To document overall, racial, ethnic and intent-specific spatiotemporal trends of firearm-related fatality rates (FRF rates) in the USA.
   Design: Cross-sectional study per year from 2000 to 2010.
   Setting: USA.
   Participants: Aggregate count of all people in the USA from 2000 to 2010.
   Outcome measures: Data from the Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System from 2000 to 2010 was used to determine annual FRF rates per 100 000 and by states, race, ethnicity and intent.
   Results: The average national 11-year FRF rate was 10.21/100 000, from 3.02 in Hawaii to 18.62 in Louisiana: 60% of states had higher than national rates and 41 states showed no temporal change. The average national FRF rates among African-Americans and Caucasians were 18.51 and 9.05/100 000 and among Hispanics and non-Hispanics were 7.13 and 10.13/100 000; Hispanics had a decreasing change of -0.18, p trend<0.0001. In states with increasing trends (Florida and Massachusetts), Caucasians and non-Hispanics drove the rise; while in states with decreasing trends (California, North Carolina, Arizona, Nevada, New York, Illinois, Maryland), Hispanics and African-Americans drove the fall. The average national FRF rates due to homicides (4.1/100 000) and suicides (5.8/100 000) remained constant, but varied between states.
   Conclusions: Endemic national FRF rates mask a wide variation in time trends between states. FRF rates were twice as high in African-Americans than Caucasians but decreased among Hispanics. Efforts to identify state-specific best practices can contribute to changes in national FRF rates that remain high.

AB Recent events highlight the importance of examining the impact of economic downturns on population health. The Great Depression of the 1930s was the most important economic downturn in the U. S. in the twentieth century. We used historical life expectancy and mortality data to examine associations of economic growth with population health for the period 1920-1940. We conducted descriptive analyses of trends and examined associations between annual changes in health indicators and annual changes in economic activity using correlations and regression models. Population health did not decline and indeed generally improved during the 4 years of the Great Depression, 1930-1933, with mortality decreasing for almost all ages, and life expectancy increasing by several years in males, females, whites, and nonwhites. For most age groups, mortality tended to peak during years of strong economic expansion (such as 1923, 1926, 1929, and 1936-1937). In contrast, the recessions of 1921, 1930-1933, and 1938 coincided with declines in mortality and gains in life expectancy. The only exception was suicide mortality which increased during the Great Depression, but accounted for less than 2% of deaths. Correlation and regression analyses confirmed a significant negative effect of economic expansions on health gains. The evolution of population health during the years 1920-1940 confirms the counterintuitive hypothesis that, as in other historical periods and market economies, population health tends to evolve better during recessions than in expansions.

AB Objective: Each year in the United States, 1.5-2.5 million individuals require hospitalization for an injury. Multiple mental, substance use, and chronic general medical disorders are endemic among injury survivors with and without traumatic brain injury (TBI), yet few studies have assessed the association between the cumulative burden of these conditions and health care outcomes. This study of patients hospitalized for an injury assessed associations between comorbid mental, substance use, and general medical disorders, TBI, and violent events or suicide attempts and the postinjury outcomes of recurrent hospitalization and death.
   Methods: Recurrent hospitalization and all-cause mortality were examined in this population-based retrospective cohort study. A total of 76,942 patients hospitalized for an injury in Washington State during 2006-2007 were followed for five years. ICD-9-CM codes identified conditions prior to or at the index injury admission. Index admissions related to injuries from firearms, assaultive violence, suicide attempts, and overdoses were identified through E-codes.
   Results: Adjusted regression analyses demonstrated a significant, dose-response relationship between an increasing cumulative burden of disorders and an increasing risk of recurrent hospitalization (four or more conditions, relative risk= 3.89, 95% confidence interval [CI]= 3.66- 4.14). Adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression demonstrated a similar relationship between increasing cumulative burden of disorders and all-cause mortality (four or more conditions, hazard ratio= 5.33, CI= 4.71-6.04).
   Conclusions: Increasing cumulative burden of disorders was associated with greater postinjury risk of recurrent hospitalization and death. Orchestrated investigative and policy efforts could introduce screening and intervention procedures that target this spectrum of comorbidity.

AB METHODS
   Most quantitative research on fertility decline in the United States ignores the potential impact of cultural and familial factors. We rely on new complete-count data from the 1880 US census to construct couple-level measures of nativity/ethnicity, religiosity, and kin availability. We include these measures with a comprehensive set of demographic, economic, and contextual variables in Poisson regression models of net marital fertility to assess their relative importance. We construct models with and without area-fixed effects to control for unobserved heterogeneity.
   CONTRIBUTION
   All else being equal, we find a strong impact of nativity on recent net marital fertility. Fertility differentials among second-generation couples relative to the native-born white population of native parentage were in most cases less than half of the differential observed among first-generation immigrants, suggesting greater assimilation to native-born American childbearing norms. Our measures of parental religiosity and familial propinquity indicate a more modest impact on marital fertility. Couples who chose biblical names for their children had approximately 3% more children than couples relying on secular names, while the presence of a potential mother-in-law in a nearby household was associated with 2% more children. Overall, our results demonstrate the need for more inclusive models of fertility behavior that include cultural and familial covariates.

AB It is common for patients who are faced with physical or psychological suffering, particularly those in the advanced stages of a disease, to have some kind of wish to hasten death (WTHD). This paper reviews and summarises the current state of knowledge about the WTHD among people with end-stage disease, doing so from a clinical perspective and on the basis of published clinical research. Studies were identified through a search strategy applied to the main scientific databases.
   Clinical studies show that the WTHD has a multi-factor aetiology. The literature review suggests-perhaps in line with better management of physical pain-that psychological and spiritual aspects, including social factors, are the most important cause of such a wish. One of the difficulties facing clinical research is the lack of terminological and conceptual precision in defining the construct. Indeed, studies frequently blur the distinction between a generic wish to die, a WTDH (whether sporadic or persistent over time), the explicit expression of a wish to die, and a request for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide.
   A notable contribution to knowledge in this field has been made by scales designed to evaluate the WTHD, although the problems of conceptual definition may once again limit the conclusions, which can be drawn from the results. Studies using qualitative methodology have also provided new information that can help in understanding such wishes.
   Further clinical research is needed to provide a complete understanding of this phenomenon and to foster the development of suitable care plans. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Lithium use for the treatment of mood disorders remains quite low, particularly in the United States compared with some European countries. Mogens Schou pioneered the study of lithium for prophylaxis of the recurrent mood disorder and encouraged its greater use. In an effort to further address the appropriate role of this drug, the multiple assets of lithium beyond its well-known antimanic effect are reviewed, and a brief summary of its side effects is outlined. It appears that lithium has positive effects in depression and suicide prevention, cognition, and reducing the incidence of dementia. It increases the length of telomeres and has positive effects in prevention of some medical illnesses. Lithium side-effect burden, especially its association with end-stage renal disease, may be less than many have surmised. New data indicate the importance of long-term prophylaxis after a first manic episode to lessen episode recurrence, allow cognition to recover to normal, and prevent various aspects of illness progression. After a first manic episode, 1 year of randomized treatment with lithium was superior to that of quetiapine, suggesting the importance of having lithium in the treatment regimen. Given the highly recurrent and progressive course of bipolar disorder sometimes even in the face of conventional treatment, the role and enhanced use of lithium deserves reconsideration.

AB The increase in firearm injuries affects all pediatric care providers. The APSA recommends improved trauma care, research, prevention, and policy to address this public health problem. Firearm injuries are the second most common cause of death in children who come to a trauma center, and pediatric surgeons provide crucial care for these patients. The American Pediatric Surgical Association (APSA) is committed to comprehensive pediatric trauma readiness, including firearm injury prevention. The APSA supports a public health approach to firearm injury, and it supports availability of quality mental health services. The APSA endorses policies for universal background checks, restrictions on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, strong child access protection laws, and a minimum purchase age of 21 years. The APSA opposes efforts to keep physicians from counseling children and families about firearms. The APSA promotes research to address this problem, including increased federal research support and research into the second victim phenomenon. The ASPA supports school safety and readiness, including bleeding control training. Although it may be daunting to try to reduce firearm deaths in children, the United States has seen success in reducing motor vehicle deaths through a multidimensional approach: prevention, design, policy, behavior, and trauma care. The ASPA believes that a similar public health approach can succeed in saving children from death and injury from firearms. The ASPA is committed to building partnerships to accomplish this.

AB The current study extended the Procrastination-Health model by examining a multiple mediation model, with two cognitive schemas (defectiveness; insufficient self-control) serving as mediators. The models were as follows: procrastination -> defectiveness -> depression; procrastination -> insufficient self-control -> depression. Participants included 412 (271 women, 141 men) United States (US) and 240 (107 women, 133 men) Pakistani college students, who responded via self-report questionnaires. In the US sample, results revealed a non-significant direct effect between procrastination and depression after consideration for the two cognitive schemas, suggesting the schemas completely mediated the model. Both defectiveness and insufficient self-control schemas were significant individual mediators. In the Pakistani model, results revealed a significant direct effect and indirect effect through the two cognitive schemas, indicating partial mediation. Only the indirect path through defectiveness schemas was significant in the Pakistani model. Given slight differences in the two models, a moderated-mediation model was analyzed to determine if the strength of the direct and indirect effects varied by nationality. The strength of the direct and indirect effects was not moderated by nationality. Overall, this is the first study to identify cognitive mediators in the procrastination-depression relationship. Such findings represent a significant extension of the Procrastination-Health model and offer some unique cognitive insights into culturally sensitive conceptualizations and treatments for depression.

TI Carbon monoxide poisoning deaths in the United States, 1999 to 2012
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID ICE STORM; INJURIES
AB Background: Unintentional, non-fire related (UNFR) carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning deaths are preventable. Surveillance of the populations most at-risk for unintentional, non-fire related (UNFR) carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is crucial for targeting prevention efforts.
   Objective: This study provides estimates on UNFR CO poisoning mortality in the United States and characterizes the at-risk populations.
   Methods: We used 1999 to 2012 data to calculate death rates. We used underlying and multiple conditions variables from death records to identify UNFR CO poisoning cases.
   Results: For this study, we identified 6136 CO poisoning fatalities during 1999 to 2012 resulting in an average of 438 deaths annually. The annual average age-adjusted death rate was 1.48 deaths permillion. Fifty four percent of the deaths occurred in a home. Age-adjusted death rates were highest for males (2.21 deaths per million) and non-Hispanic blacks (1.74 deaths per million). The age-specific death rate was highest for those aged >= 85 years (6.00 deaths per million). The annual rate of UNFR CO poisoning deaths did not change substantially during the study period, but we observed a decrease in the rate of suicide and unintentional fire related cases.
   Conclusion: CO poisoning was the second most common non-medicinal poisonings death. Developing and enhancing current public health interventions could reduce ongoing exposures to CO from common sources, such as those in the residential setting. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Mental health issues are epidemic among youth in the United States today. Recent studies suggest that up to 50% of all teenagers have complaints related to stress, anxiety, and/or depression. This problem is accompanied by an unprecedented rise in the rates of child and teen suicide in the United States. In response to this epidemic, the American Academy of Pediatrics is recommending universal depression screening for all teens. Medications are available to ameliorate mental health disorders, and many can be safely used in the primary care setting. However, many of these medications have unwanted side effects or may not be familiar to the primary care physician. For these reasons and others, primary care physicians require additional approaches to respond to the challenges imposed by a growing number of patients requiring mental health support. Medical Yoga Therapy, prescribed by a physician with special yoga therapy training, offers a safe and effective way to serve the patient with physical or mental challenges disabilities. Medical Yoga therapy is an individualized and personal approach to the patient, and it may be integrated with any current therapy or medical regimen. Here, evidence for medical yoga is reviewed in the context of an adolescent patient with a common disorder. Yoga practices, with particular focus on mindfulness, offer a safe and effective intervention for a growing number of pediatric patients.

AB Background: Intoxication (or poisoning) that necessitates hospitalization remains an important source of morbidity in children.
   Objective: To determine changes, during an 11-year period (1987-1997), in the incidence of hospitalization due to intoxication among children in Washington State and circumstances of ingestion, agents used, hospital length of stay, charges, and mortality. Methods: A computerized database of all hospital discharges (Comprehensive Hospital Abstract Reporting System [CHARS] database) in Washington was used. Cases included all children younger than 19 years with a primary or secondary diagnosis for an intoxication or with an external cause of injury code (E code) for an intoxication from 1987 to 1997.
   Results: There were 7322 hospitalizations (45 per 100 000 children per year); the annual rate significantly decreased during the study period. Most patients (75%) were teenagers. Sixty-five percent were female. Pharmaceutical agents were used in 80% of cases. Analgesics were the most commonly used (34%), followed by antidepressants (12%) and psychotropic drugs (8%). Nonpharmaceutical agents were more prevalent in children younger than 12 years than in teenagers. Self-inflicted intoxication was the most frequent cause identified by E codes (47%). Median length of stay was 1 day, and median hospital charges were $2096. Mortality was low (0.2%) and did not change significantly over time.
   Conclusions: Acute intoxication continues to be an important cause of hospitalization in children. The type of agent involved did not change significantly over time. Teenage girls continue as the highest risk group for suicide attempt from ingestions. Self-inflicted intoxications were associated with,higher costs, length of stay, and readmissions. Although preventive measures and development of poison centers have contributed to decrease mortality from acute intoxication in children in the last 50 years, efforts need to be targeted toward suicide prevention, especially among teenage girls.

AB The main objective of the present study was to examine whether self-inflicted burn patients would differ from nonintentional, nonwork related burn patients on psychiatric and personality characteristics. Sociodemographic and injury related factors were also compared. Self-inflicted (N = 15) and nonintentional (N = 178) burn patient samples were drawn from a larger study examining physical and psychosocial outcomes following major burn. Psychiatric/personality factors included self-reported psychiatric treatment history, alcohol/drug use, preburn mental health (Short Form Health Survey-12 MCS) and neuroticism (NEO five factor inventory). Sociodemographic factors and injury related factors were obtained through medical records. Comparisons between the self-inflicted and the nonintentional groups were made using Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for continuous variables. The self-inflicted group was 11.5 times more likely to report prior psychiatric treatment relative to the nonintentional burn group (P < .001) and 4.3 times more likely to have previously abused alcohol (P = .02). Compared to nonintentional burn patients, self-inflicted burn patients reported worse preburn mental health (P < .001). There were no differences on TBSA (P = .52) or sociodemographic characteristics (P values >.08). Relative to survivors of nonintentional burns, self-inflicted burn patients in the United States demonstrate high psychiatric comorbidity. Standards of care must be developed to optimize treatment procedures and recovery outcomes in this subgroup.

AB Objectives. We examined the relationship between unemployment and mortality in Germany, a coordinated market economy, and the United States, a liberal market economy.
   Methods. We followed 2 working-age cohorts from the German Socioeconomic Panel and the US Panel Study of Income Dynamics from 1984 to 2005. We defined unemployment as unemployed at the time of survey. We used discrete-time survival analysis, adjusting for potential confounders.
   Results. There was an unemployment mortality association among Americans (relative risk [RR] = 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.7, 3.4), but not among Germans (RR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.0, 2.0). In education-stratified models, there was an association among minimum-skilled (RR = 2.6; 95% CI = 1.4, 4.7) and medium-skilled (RR =2.4; 95% CI = 1.5, 3.8) Americans, but not among minimum- and medium-skilled Germans. There was no association among high-skilled Americans, but an association among high-skilled Germans (RR = 3.0; 95% CI = 1.3, 7.0), although this was limited to those educated in East Germany. Minimum- and medium-skilled unemployed Americans had the highest absolute risks of dying.
   Conclusions. The higher risk of dying for minimum- and medium-skilled unemployed Americans, not found among Germans, suggests that the unemployment mortality relationship may be mediated by the institutional and economic environment.

AB Numerous scholars have stated that there is a silent crisis in men's mental health. In this article, we aim to provide an overview of core issues in the field of men's mental health, including a discussion of key social determinants as well as implications for mental health services. Firstly, we review the basic epidemiology of mental disorders with a high incidence and prevalence in men, including suicide and substance use disorder. Secondly, we examine controversies around the low reported rates of depression in men, discussing possible measurement and reporting biases. Thirdly, we explore common risk factors and social determinants that may explain higher rates of certain mental health outcomes in men. This includes a discussion of 1) occupational and employment issues; 2) family issues and divorce; 3) adverse childhood experience; and 4) other life transitions, notably parenthood. Fourthly, we document and analyze low rates of mental health service utilization in men. This includes a consideration of the role of dominant notions of masculinity (such as stubbornness and self-reliance) in deterring service utilization. Fifthly, we note that some discourse on the role of masculinity contains much victim blaming, often adopting a reproachful deficit-based model. We argue that this can deflect attention away from social determinants as well as issues within the mental health system, such as claims that it is feminized and unresponsive to men's needs. We conclude by calling for a multipronged public health-inspired approach to improve men's mental health, involving concerted action at the individual, health services, and societal levels.

TI The Economic Burden of Adults With Major Depressive Disorder in the

LA English
DT Article

AB Background: The economic burden of depression in the United States-including major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, and dysthymia-was estimated at $83.1 billion in 2000. We update these findings using recent data, focusing on MDD alone and accounting for comorbid physical and psychiatric disorders.
   Method: Using national survey (DSM-IV criteria) and administrative claims data (ICD-9 codes), we estimate the incremental economic burden of individuals with MDD as well as the share of these costs attributable to MDD, with attention to any changes that occurred between 2005 and 2010.
   Results: The incremental economic burden of individuals with MDD increased by 21.5% (from $173.2 billion to $210.5 billion, inflation-adjusted dollars). The composition of these costs remained stable, with approximately 45% attributable to direct costs, 5% to suicide-related costs, and 50% to workplace costs. Only 38% of the total costs were due to MDD itself as opposed to comorbid conditions.
   Conclusions: Comorbid conditions account for the largest portion of the growing economic burden of MDD. Future research should analyze further these comorbidities as well as the relative importance of factors contributing to that growing burden. These include population growth, increase in MDD prevalence, increase in treatment cost per individual with MDD, changes in employment and treatment rates, as well as changes in the composition and quality of MDD treatment services.

AB Objective: Gender disparities in mental health highlight the need to include gender equity measures when planning, implementing, and evaluating mental health programs at national, state or provincial, and municipal levels. This study aimed to identify, select, and assess the feasibility of comparing gender-sensitive mental health indicators in a low- (Peru), middle- (Colombia), and high- (Canada) income country. Methods: The indicators were selected by a multidisciplinary group of experts who used criteria and a framework proposed by the World Health Organization. Data from national, population-based databases from each country were used to measure the indicators. Results: Seven indicators (12-month prevalence of the following: depression, psychological distress, generalized anxiety disorder, suicide attempts, alcohol dependence, mental health service use, and psychological impairment) were feasible for measurement in at least two countries. Only five indicators were comparable between two countries, and only one was comparable among all countries (suicide attempts). The indicators that showed the greatest inequities between men and women were depression, anxiety, suicide attempts, use of mental health services, and alcohol dependence. Female-to-male ratios for prevalence of mental illness ranged from .1 to 2.3, and ratios for service use ranged from 1.3 to 1.9. Significant trends were found when the indicators were considered by age, education, marital status, and income. Conclusions: Some of these indicators can be used to identify populations most vulnerable to gender inequities in mental health. The results from this study may provide useful information to program planners who aim to implement, improve, and monitor national mental health strategies that reduce gender inequities under different national conditions.

AB The U.S. Surgeon General's report Mental Health: Culture, Race, and Ethnicity-A Supplement to Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2001) was arguably the best single scholarly contribution on the mental health of ethnic minority groups in the United States. Over 10 years have now elapsed since its publication in 2001. This article highlights advances and illuminates gaps in the knowledge gained about the mental health and psychotherapeutic treatment of Asian Americans in the past decade. Though larger epidemiological surveys point to lower prevalence rates of mental illness in Asian Americans, further advances are needed in culturally valid assessment and quantification of cultural biases in symptom reporting in order to draw definitive conclusions about the state of Asian American mental health. A focus on prevalence in Asian Americans as a whole also shrouds important subgroup elevations such as heightened suicide risk in Asian elderly women or greater posttraumatic stress disorder in Southeast Asian refugees. Despite important developments in our knowledge about mental health prevalence, help-seeking behaviors, and culturally competent treatments for Asian Americans, it appears that troublingly low rates of service utilization still remain even when one accounts for the seemingly low prevalence rates among Asian Americans. Some progress has been made in the cultural adaptations of psychotherapy treatments for Asian Americans. In order to reduce mental health care disparities, greater efforts are needed to provide outreach at the community level and to bridge the gap between mental health and other medical or alternative health facilities. We call for innovation and provide recommendations to address these issues in the next decade.

AB Exposure to carbon monoxide (CO), the odorless, colorless gas resulting from incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons, is preventable. Despite the significant risk of morbidity and mortality associated with CO poisoning, there currently exists no active national CO surveillance system in the United States (U.S.). Our study aims to use electronic health record data to describe the epidemiology of CO poisoning in the Veterans Health Administration healthcare population.
   We identified unique inpatient and outpatient encounters coded with International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for CO poisoning and analyzed relevant demographic, laboratory, treatment, and death data from January 2010 through December 2017 for Veterans across all 50 U.S. states and Puerto Rico. Statistical methods used were 95% CI calculations and the two-tailed z test for proportions.
   We identified 5491 unique patients with CO poisoning, of which 1755 (32%) were confirmed/probable and 3736 (68%) were suspected. Unintentional poisoning was most common (72.9%) overall. Age less than 65 years, residence in Midwest U.S. Census region versus South or West, and winter seasonal trend were characteristics associated with confirmed/probable CO poisoning. Twenty-six deaths (1.5%) occurred within 30 days of confirmed/probable CO poisoning and were primarily caused by cardiovascular events (42%) or anoxic encephalopathy (15%).
   Our findings support the use of ICD-coded data for targeted CO poisoning surveillance, however, improvements are needed in ICD coding to reduce the percentage of cases coded with unknown injury intent and/or CO poisoning source. Prevalence of CO poisoning among Veterans is consistent with other U.S. estimates. Since most cases are unintentional, opportunities exist for provider and patient education to reduce risk.

TI THE CALCULUS OF SHAREHOLDERS' CONSENT: A CONSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS THEORY

SO UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
LA English
DT Article
ID APPRAISAL REMEDY; DISSENTING STOCKHOLDERS; OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE; LAW;
   EXCHANGES; BEHAVIOR; COSTS; ESSAY
AB The charter of a corporation is the "constitution" agreed to by all its members. The charter, however, is not a "suicide pact," it can be amended according to the charter amendment rules in corporate law when circumstances change. These charter amendment rules vary significantly across jurisdictions. In Delaware, shareholders can amend the charter with a simple majority vote of shares. The amendment must be initiated by the board of directors and decisions to amend the charter are made usually by a supermajority vote of shares. Board approval is not necessary in the United Kingdom, Germany, or France. Within a given jurisdiction, the rules governing the amendment of different provisions are also very different. This Article makes the first attempt to employ the constitutional economic theory developed by Buchanan and Tullock to explain different charter amendment rules. It identifies a fundamental tradeoff between the needs of adaptation and commitment. If charter amendment rules are too procedurally burdensome, they may harm the adaptation of corporate charters. If they do not impose meaningful regulation on charter amendment, minority shareholders cannot be sure that corporate insiders or controlling shareholders would not amend the charter in the midstream to harm shareholders' interests. Different states may choose different charter amendment rules to achieve a balance between adaptation and commitment. The choice between different charter amendment rules made by different states can be explained by several factors, including institutional investors and judicial capacity. This theory sheds new light on a series of issues in the corporate law literature, including the explanation for mandatory rules and appraisal rights in corporate law, the debate of increasing shareholder power in the United States, and why law, rather than contract, is important in corporate governance.

SO POPULATION HEALTH METRICS
LA English
DT Review
DE Life expectancy; Injury death; Cost of injury
ID OVERDOSE DEATHS; PREVENTION; HEALTH; DRUG
AB Background: During the previous century the average lifespan in the United States (US) increased by over 30 years, with much of this increase attributed to public health initiatives. This report examines further gains that might be achieved through reduced occurrence of injury-related death.
   Methods: US life tables and injury death rate data were used to estimate potential increases in life expectancy assuming various reductions in the rate of fatal injuries. Corresponding numbers of deaths potentially averted annually were also estimated; unit (per death) medical and lifetime work loss costs were employed to estimate total costs potentially averted annually.
   Results: Through elimination of injury as a cause of death, average US life expectancy at birth could be increased by approximately 1.5 years, with notable variations by sex, ethnicity, and race. More conservatively, average life expectancy at birth could be increased by 0.41 years assuming that the national injury death rate could be brought into line with the lowest state-specific rate. Under this more conservative but plausible assumption, an estimated 48,400 injury deaths and $61 billion in medical and work loss costs would be averted annually.
   Conclusions: Increases in life expectancy of the magnitude considered in this report are arguably attainable based on long-term historical reductions in the US injury death rate, as well as significant continuing reductions seen in other developed countries. Contemporary evidence-based interventions can play an important role in reducing injury-related deaths, such as those due to drug overdoses and older adult falls, as well as suicides.

ID SUICIDE; ASSOCIATION; LEGISLATION; OWNERSHIP; RATES; HOMICIDE; ACCESS;
   RISK; FATALITIES; CHILDREN
AB BACKGROUND: Firearms are the second leading cause of pediatric death in the United States. There is significant variation in firearm legislation at the state level. Recently, 3 state laws were associated with a reduction in overall deaths from firearms: universal background checks for firearm purchases, universal background checks for ammunition purchases, and identification requirement for firearms. We sought to determine if stricter firearm legislation at the state level is associated with lower pediatric firearm-related mortality. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study in which we used 2011-2015 Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System and Census data. We measured the association of the (1) strictness of firearm legislation (gun law score) and (2) presence of the 3 aforementioned gun laws with pediatric firearm-related mortality. We performed negative binomial regression accounting for differences in state-level characteristics (population-based race and ethnicity, education, income, and gun ownership) to derive mortality rate ratios associated with a 10-point change in each predictor and predicted mortality rates. RESULTS: A total of 21 241 children died of firearm-related injuries during the 5-year period. States with stricter gun laws had lower rates of firearm-related pediatric mortality (adjusted incident rate ratio 0.96 [0.93-0.99]). States with laws requiring universal background checks for firearm purchase in effect for >= 5 years had lower pediatric firearm-related mortality rates (adjusted incident rate ratio 0.65 [0.46-0.90]). CONCLUSIONS: In this 5-year analysis, states with stricter gun laws and laws requiring universal background checks for firearm purchase had lower firearm-related pediatric mortality rates. These findings support the need for further investigation to understand the impact of firearm legislation on pediatric mortality.

AB Using panel data from US states over the period 1941-2002, I measure the impact of gubernatorial partisanship on a wide range of different policy settings and economic outcomes. Across 32 measures, there are surprisingly few differences in policy settings, social outcomes and economic outcomes under Democrat and Republican Governors. In terms of policies, Democratic Governors tend to prefer slightly higher minimum wages. Under Republican Governors, incarceration rates are higher, while welfare caseloads are higher under Democratic Governors. In terms of social and economic outcomes, Democratic Governors tend to preside over higher median post-tax income, lower post-tax inequality, and lower unemployment rates. However, for 26 of the 32 dependent variables, gubernatorial partisanship does not have a statistically significant impact on policy outcomes and social welfare. I find no evidence of gubernatorial partisan differences in tax rates, welfare generosity, the number of government employees or their salaries, state revenue, incarceration rates, execution rates, pre-tax incomes and inequality, crime rates, suicide rates, and test scores. These results are robust to the use of regression discontinuity estimation, to take account of the possibility of reverse causality. Overall, it seems that Governors behave in a fairly non-ideological manner. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Although nearly all states in the United States require school districts to adopt anti-bullying policies, little research examines the effect of these policies on student bullying and health. Using a statewide sample, we investigated associations between the quality of school district anti-bullying policies and student bullying involvement and adjustment.
   METHODS: School district anti-bullying policies ( N= 208) were coded for their quality based on established criteria. District-level data were combined with student reports of bullying involvement, emotional distress, and school connectedness from a state surveillance survey of 6th, 9th, and 12th grade students (N= 93,437).
   RESULTS: Results indicated that policy quality was positively related to bullying victimization. Furthermore, students reporting frequent perpetration/victimization who also attended districts with high-quality policies reported more emotional distress and less school connectedness compared with students attending districts with low quality policies. Although statistically significant, the magnitude of these associations was small.
   CONCLUSIONS: Having a high-quality school district anti-bullying policy is not sufficient to reduce bullying and protect bullying-involved young people. Future studies examining policy implementation will inform best practices in bullying prevention.

TI Body Weight and Suicidal Behavior in Adolescent Females: The Role of
   Self-Perceptions
SO JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH POLICY AND ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
ID PERCEIVED WEIGHT; MASS INDEX; OBESITY; ASSOCIATIONS; PREVALENCE;
   DISORDERS; OUTCOMES
AB Background: Suicide is the third leading cause of death among adolescents and recent data indicate that the suicide rate, particularly for young girls, is increasing. Excess body weight among adolescents has also been documented widely over the last two decades and is considered one of the most pressing public health concerns today. Previous literature has examined the relationship between actual body weight and suicidal behavior, but there is little evidence on self-perception of weight and suicidal behaviors.
   Aim of the Study: This study examines the relationship between body weight and suicidal behaviors using a rich longitudinal data set of a large nationally-representative sample of female adolescents to account for a number of confounding factors. The study explores the relationship, not only between actual weight status and suicidal behaviors, but also between self-perception of weight and suicidal behaviors.
   Method: Using data from a nationally-representative sample of adolescents in the United States, the study ascertains the effect of body weight status on suicidal behaviors by estimating endogeneity-corrected models including school-level fixed effects to account for bi-directionality and unobserved confounders. Actual body weight status was calculated using interviewer-measured height and weight. The study also used a measure of self-perceived weight status to compare how actual versus self-perceived weight status affects suicidal behavior. Thinking about committing suicide and attempting to commit suicide in the past 12 months were utilized as dichotomous measures of suicidal behaviors. Potential mediators between suicidal behaviors and weight status such as family history of suicide, participation in risky health behaviors and parental characteristics were also controlled for in the analysis. The analytical sample consists of 5,430 adolescent females aged 11 to 18.
   Results: The results suggest that both self-perceived and measured weight status (overweight or obese) increase a female adolescent's probability of suicidal ideation, with self-perceived weight status causing a larger increase in suicidal ideation. There is some evidence that body weight status affects suicide attempts, but these results are much less robust. Finally, endogeneity bias is shown to be of concern in all estimates, and failing to account for this bias is likely to understate any estimated effect.
   Implications for Health Policy: The results have important implications for the design of public health programs to prevent adolescent suicide, especially among female adolescents. Understanding the mechanisms through which adolescents are motivated to take such dire actions will help to allocate resources into the treatment areas which are most effective in stemming the rise of suicidal behaviors. This study identifies one key factor, self perception of weight, which may be an avenue for mental health care providers to continue exploring.
   Implications for Future Research: Further research on this topic could include not only studying the impact of body weight on suicidal behaviors, but also examining the relationships between body weight and other important mental health outcomes such as psychological distress and major depressive episodes.

DT Article
DE elections; selection of judges; Supreme Court; Congress; states rights
AB In December 2000, when the Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari first in Bush v Palm Beach County Canvassing Board, and then in Bush v Gore, most constitutional scholars were surprised if not shocked as a Court with a reputation of deference towards the States had just accepted to hear cases int he presidential election dispute which seemed essentially to concern the interpretation fo the Florida election statutes. In doing so, the Court seemed to promise a quick resolution to avert the impending constitutional crisis which loomed if the election were to be decided in Congress in January 2001. This article claims that the Court acted in this case as a political body ready to risk its prestige for the good of the country. The decision of the Supreme Court to intervene should be analyzed within the broader context of the relation between the three branches of government as the justices perceived it in 2000. The stakes were high as the Court itself, and its future composition, were among the key elements of the election. Did the Court, as some claim, commit institutional suicide, or did it rather make a wise and prudent use of its political capital?

AB This article focuses on homicides (murders and nonnegligent manslaughter) in Alaska from 1999 to 2006, through a comparison of homicides in Anchorage and in the rest of the state. Data used include the Supplementary Homicide Reports of the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Program Data for Alaska, newspaper surveillance, and Alaska Vital Statistics. Geographic, cultural and demographic factors are used to help provide an explanation of Alaska's unusual homicide pattern, a relatively high rate of female homicide victims. In addition, the article compares the Alaska findings to those of the United States as a whole, to place homicide in the state within a larger context. The general theoretical framework is a consideration of disorganization theory, which is used to better understand homicides in Alaska and the particular vulnerability of Alaskan Native women who migrate to Anchorage from rural villages. Topics examined include the gender and race of victims, the relationship between the victim and perpetrator, the time of year of the homicide, the location (home or elsewhere), the region of Alaska, and the weapon used in the homicide. Negligent manslaughter and child witnesses to murder are also discussed. A number of suggestions are made for the reduction of homicides in Alaska.

TI A Continuum of Nation-State Resiliency to Watershed Terrorist Events
SO ARMED FORCES & SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
DE international security; national security; terrorism; resiliency;
   counterterrorism
AB This article is a qualitative analysis of nation-state population "resiliency'' to several spectacular and/or highly symbolic terrorist assaults that were watershed events. It draws heavily from qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) frameworks to isolate and identify the presence of what Goertz calls the "secondary dimensions'' of a "primary concept'' such as resiliency to terrorist assaults. In turn, the presence of those secondary dimensions and their strength presuppose and derive from "tertiary indicators'' that are the basic metrics and concrete manifestations of those secondary dimensions. The nation-states under consideration include the London bombings of 2005, the United States for 9/11, the Madrid bombings of 2004, the first suicide bombings within pre-1967 boundaries of Israel, and the Russian Federation in the case of the 2002 terrorist assault against the Dubrovka Theater in Moscow. The results serve as the basis for the development of a "resiliency continuum'' of nation-states where placement of those countries on the continuum reflect "nonresilient,'' "semiresilient,'' and "resilient'' conditions, themselves defined by the number of secondary dimensions found in each case study. In the process, the analysis illuminates possible interconnections between "context specific'' factors, such as a country's historical experience with terrorism and population characteristics (e. g., education levels, degree of heterogeneity) to the resiliency or nonresiliency condition, and describes possible links between exogenous "systems factors'' such as war and power ranking to the resiliency condition.

AB PurposeTo investigate whether chronic psychosocial work stressors (low job control, high job demands, job strain, low supervisor and coworker support, job insecurity, and long work hours) are longitudinally associated with suicidal ideation in a working population.MethodsFive-hundred seventy-eight workers (aged 34-69) were chosen for this analysis from those who participated in both project 1 (2004-2006at baseline) and project 4 (2004-2009at follow-up) of the Midlife Development in the United States II study. The median time interval between the two projects was 26months (range 2-62months).ResultsAbout 11% of the workers reported suicidal ideation at follow-up, while 3% of them reported moderate/severe suicidal ideation at follow-up. After controlling for age, marital status, race, family history of suicide, and suicidal ideation at baseline, low skill discretion and job strain (a combination of low job control and high job demands) were associated with total suicidal ideation. After excluding those with suicidal ideation at baseline from analysis and further controlling for other work stressors, job strain was strongly associated with moderate/severe suicidal ideation: ORs, 4.29 (1.30-14.15) for quartile-based job strain and 3.77 (1.21-11.70) for median-based job strain. Long work hours (>40h/week vs. 40h/week) also increased the likelihood for moderate/severe suicidal ideation: OR 4.06 (1.08-15.19).ConclusionsJob strain and long work hours were longitudinally associated with moderate/severe suicidal ideation. Increasing job control and ensuring optimal level of work demands, including 40h or less of work per week may be an important strategy for the prevention of suicide in working populations.

DE communication; crime; domestic terrorism; law enforcement
AB Uses of outdoor natural areas, like National Forests in the United States, have been undergoing change. Some changes, including criminal activities and domestic terrorism, may have quite important impacts to outdoor enthusiasts and managers. Activities include some relatively traditional management challenges, like arson and thefts, and newer challenges. such as domestic violence and murder. To better understand the prevalence and impacts of these activities, selected managers in the western United Slates were interviewed in summer and fall 1998. Results indicate criminal activities and domestic terrorism are found in both urban-interface and rural sites. The most prevalent challenges were arson, criminal damage, domestic violence, dumping of household trash and landscape materials, marijuana cultivation. satanic cult activity, and thefts. Not as prevalent but found in almost all study sites were body dumping, extremist group activity gang activity, murders, and suicides. Managers felt that most outdoor recreationists were unaffected by the activities. Most managers noted the increasing prevalence and the costs to management in time, personnel, and in other ways. They noted that their job had ceased being one of natural resources law enforcement and became one of "city" law enforcement. The findings of the study raise serious issues that require additional research.

AB Context: Psychiatric disorder is a major risk factor for suicidality but has poor positive predictive value.
   Objectives: To characterize proximal risks for suicidality associated with anxiety, depressive, disruptive behavior, and substance use disorders, and to test whether there are critical combinations of disorders that discriminate at-risk youth independent of severity of psychopathology.
   Design: The Great Smoky Mountains Study, a representative sample of children and adolescents aged 9 to 16 years from the southeastern United States. Subjects and their parents were interviewed on multiple occasions from 1993 to 2000 about the subjects' recent psychiatric and suicidal history.
   Setting: An epidemiological sample of youth.
   Participants: The sample included 1420 individual subjects with 6676 records across 8 waves of data collection.
   Main Outcome Measures: Wanting to die, suicidal ideation, suicide plans, or suicide attempt during the past 3 months.
   Results: Eleven broad psychiatric profiles discriminated suicidal youth. Risk was greatest in association with current depression plus anxiety (specifically GAD [generalized anxiety disorder]) (odds ratio, 468.53) or depression plus a disruptive disorder (primarily ODD [oppositional-defiant disorder]) (odds ratio, 222.94). Unless comorbid, anxiety and substance use disorders were not proximally associated with suicidality. The severity of symptom-related impairment and, in some cases, total symptom load explained risk associated with all psychiatric profiles except depression plus anxiety, specifically GAD (adjusted odds ratio, 50.16). Severity of impairment and poverty defined by federal guidelines for families were both independent risk factors, irrespective of psychiatric profile. Suicidal youth without diagnosable disorders had subthreshold (mostly disruptive) disorders, disabling relationship difficulties, or psychiatric symptoms without associated impairment.
   Conclusions: Severity of symptom-related impairment and total symptom load explained most of the risk for suicidality associated with current psychiatric disorders. Only depression plus GAD discriminated at-risk youth independent of severity of psychopathology.

ID EXPERIENCE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; HOSPITALS; TRENDS
AB The Italian mental health care is based on Law 180 (it. Legge 180), also called Legge Basaglia, from the name of the author of the reform, Franco Basaglia. It was adopted on May 13th 1978. The new legislation resulted from the actions of a strong anti-psychiatric movement and it brought about a major change in the organization of psychiatric care. The reform and its consequences were widely studied by the researchers, especially in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The authors point out many successes of the reform, especially in its beginning. They seek the sources of its failure in a faulty and incomplete implementation. Legge Basaglia completely changed the structure of mental health care in Italy, finally bringing psychiatry back to medicine and the general hospitals, as well as promoting community-based psychiatry. Deinstitutionalization in Italy was not related to an increase in compulsory psychiatric hospitalizations, suicide attempts by the mentally ill, nor did it raise the number of crimes committed by them. It also did not cause common trans-institutionalization, with the transfer of patients to the private sector, as predicted by its opponents.

AB Although seminal reviews have been published on acculturation and mental health in adults and adolescents, far less is known about how acculturation influences adolescent interpersonal and self-directed violence. This article aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive review of research linking acculturation and violence behavior for adolescents of three minority populations: Latino, Asian/Pacific Islander (A/PI), and American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN). The preponderance of evidence from studies on Latino and A/PI youth indicate that higher levels of adolescent assimilation (i.e., measured by time in the United States, English language use, U. S. cultural involvement, or individualism scales) were a risk factor for youth violence. Ethnic group identity or culture-of-origin involvement appear to be cultural assets against youth violence with supporting evidence from studies on A/PI youth; however, more studies are needed on Latino and AI/AN youth. Although some evidence shows low acculturation or cultural marginality to be a risk factor for higher levels of fear, victimization, and being bullied, low acculturation also serves as a protective factor against dating violence victimization for Latino youth. An important emerging trend in both the Latino and, to a lesser extent, A/PI youth literature shows that the impact of acculturation processes on youth aggression and violence can be mediated by family dynamics. The literature on acculturation and self-directed violence is extremely limited and has conflicting results across the examined groups, with high acculturation being a risk factor for Latinos, low acculturation being a risk factor of A/PI youth, and acculturation-related variables being unrelated to suicidal behavior among AI/AN youth. Bicultural skills training as a youth violence and suicide prevention practice is discussed.

AB Insufficient sleep is a risk factor for depression, suicidality, and substance use, yet little is known about gender, ethnic, and community-level differences in sleep and its associated outcomes, especially during adolescence. Further, much of the prior work has compared groups of teens getting plenty as opposed to insufficient amounts of sleep rather than examine sleep hours continuously. The present study examined adolescent weekday self-reported sleep duration and its links with hopelessness, suicidality, and substance use in a suburban community with very early high school start times. We utilized a large (N = 27,939, 51.2 % female) and ethnically diverse sample of adolescents from the 2009 Fairfax County (Virginia) Youth Survey, an anonymous, self-report, population-level survey administered to all 8th, 10th and 12th grade students in public schools in the county. High-school students reported an average 6.5 h of sleep per school night, with 20 % obtaining a parts per thousand currency sign5 h, and only 3 % reporting the recommended 9 h/night. Females and minority youth obtained even less sleep on average, and the reduction in sleep in the transition from middle school to high school was more pronounced for females and for Asian students. Hierarchical, multivariate, logistic regression analyses, controlling for background variables, indicated that just 1 h less of weekday sleep was associated with significantly greater odds of feeling hopeless, seriously considering suicide, suicide attempts, and substance use. Relationships between sleep duration and suicidality were stronger for male teens, and sleep duration was more associated with hopelessness for white students compared to most ethnic minority groups. Implications for intervention at multiple levels are discussed.

AB The mandate of a formal child death review (CDR) system is to advance understanding of how and why children die, to improve child health and safety, and to prevent deaths and injuries in the future. Areas in which CDR has provided valuable information and/or intervention include sudden death in infancy, unintentional injuries (the leading cause of death in Canadian children and youth one to 19 years of age), suicide in youth, and deaths due to homicide or child maltreatment. When collected systematically using common definitions, information regarding deaths in children and youth can help with understanding the scope of problems. Information about the context of a death can inform potential prevention or intervention activities. CDR can improve medical and mental health best practices, child welfare policies and procedures, and legislation and education relevant to public health and safety. In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, CDR processes are mandated by legislation. In Canada, death review teams have diverse structures and functions, and the CDR system is less well developed. The present statement addresses the need for formal, organized child and youth death review in Canada to help strengthen and systemize injury and death prevention efforts.

ID SUICIDE
AB In a 2012 survey, in the United States alone, there were more than 35 000 reported suicides with approximately 1800 of being psychiatric inpatients. Recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports indicate an upward trend in these numbers. In psychiatric facilities, staff perform intermittent or continuous observation of patients manually in order to prevent such tragedies, but studies show that they are insufficient, and also consume staff time and resources. In this paper, we present the Watch-Dog system, to address the problem of detecting self-harming activities when attempted by in-patients in clinical settings. Watch-Dog comprises of three key components-Data sensed by tiny accelerometer sensors worn on wrists of subjects; an efficient algorithm to classify whether a user is active versus dormant (i.e., performing a physical activity versus not performing any activity); and a novel decision selection algorithm based on random forests and continuity indices for fine grained activity classification. With data acquired from 11 subjects performing a series of activities (both self-harming and otherwise), Watch-Dog achieves a classification accuracy of 98%, 94%, and 70% for same-user 10-fold cross-validation, cross-user 10-fold cross-validation, and cross-user leave-one-out evaluation, respectively. We believe that the problem addressed in this paper is practical, important, and timely. We also believe that our proposed system is practically deployable, and related discussions are provided in this paper.

AB Background: Few studies have examined the associations between childhood sexual abuse (CSA), co-occurrence with other types of maltreatment and adult mental health outcomes, specifically among males. The objectives of this study were to: 1) determine the prevalence of males who have experienced a) childhood maltreatment without CSA; b) CSA without other forms of childhood maltreatment; and c) CSA along with other forms of childhood maltreatment; and 2) determine the relationship between CSA among males and mood, anxiety, substance and personality disorders and suicide attempts.
   Methods: Data were drawn from the 2004-2005 National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) and limited to males age 20 years old and older (n = 14,564). Child maltreatment included harsh physical punishment, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, emotional neglect, physical neglect and exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV).
   Results: Emotional abuse, physical abuse, and exposure to IPV were the most common forms of maltreatment that co-occurred with CSA among males. A history of CSA only, and CSA co-occurring with other types of child maltreatment, resulted in higher odds for many mental disorders and suicide attempts compared to a history of child maltreatment without CSA.
   Conclusions: Child maltreatment is associated with increased odds of mental disorders among males. Larger effects were noted for many mental disorders and suicide attempts for males who experienced CSA with or without other child maltreatment types compared to those who did not experience CSA. These results are important for understanding the significant long-term effects of CSA among males. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: To identify psychosocial and clinical correlates of suicidal ideation in medical inpatients.
   Method: In a cross-sectional study, all adults consecutively admitted to the medical wards of a University Hospital had their names recorded and were randomized and evaluated during the first week of admission. Suicidal ideation was assessed using Item 9 of Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The Beck Depression Inventory, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, the WHO Subjective well-being scale, the Charlson Comorbidity Index and other numerical rating scales (pain and self-reported physical illness severity) were used. Patients with less than four confidants were considered with poor social support. The Student's t test, Mann-Whitney U test, chi-square test and stepwise logistic regression analysis were used.
   Results: Of the 1092 patients who composed the sample, 7.2% reported having suicidal ideation. After adjusting for psychosocial and clinical confounders, prior suicide attempts (OR: 4.41; 95% CI: 2.12-9.15; P<.001), depressive symptoms (OR: 1.11; 95% Cl: 1.06-1.17; P<.001), severe anxiety symptoms (OR: 3.04; 95% CI: 1.47-6.26; P=.003) and poor social support (OR: 2.02; 95% CI:1.03-3.96; P=.04) were independently associated with suicidal ideation.
   Conclusions: Three out of the four correlates of suicidal ideation in medical inpatients are potentially modifiable factors: severe anxiety, depressive symptoms and poor social support. The fourth variable, prior suicide attempts, is not modifiable but should serve as a red flag to suspect and investigate current suicide risk. These findings highlight the importance of suicidal ideation as a proxy for the distress that is incumbent upon physicians to manage if they wish to provide excellent and comprehensive inpatient care.

AB Self-inflicted burns (SIB) are responsible for 2-6% of admissions to Burn Units in Europe and North America, and for as many as 25% of admissions in developing nations. Recently, a promising new tool was proposed to stratify SIB patients in the following subgroups: "typical", "delirious", and "reactive". However, as far as the authors know, the clinical usefulness of this instrument has not yet been validated by others.
   We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of 56 patients admitted to our Burn Unit with the diagnosis of SIB injury in the past 14 years. The following parameters were evaluated: demographic features; psychiatric illness; substance abuse; mechanism of injury; burn depth, total body surface area (TBSA) involved, Abbreviated Burn Severity Index (ABSI); length of hospital stay, and mortality. All patients were followed up by a psychologist and a psychiatrist, and were classified according to the SIB-Typology Tool, into three classes: "typical", "delirious" and "reactive".
   There was a slight predominance of the "typical" type (44.6%), followed by the "delirious" type (30.4%), and, finally the "reactive" type (25.0%). Mortality was significantly higher in the "typical" subgroup. In conclusion, the SIB-Typology Tool appears to be a valuable instrument in the clinical management of SIB patients.

AB BACKGROUND: This study examines the relationship of marital status to depression, positive and negative symptoms, quality of life, and suicidal ideation among 211 patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and subsyndromal depressive symptoms. We hypothesized that single participants would have more severe symptomatology than married and cohabitating participants.
   METHODS: Outpatients, age 40 or older, were diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders using the MINI Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis 1 Disorders. Participants exhibited a score of >= 8 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression but did not meet criteria for a major depressive episode.
   RESULTS: Participants who were married or cohabitating had a later age of onset of first psychotic episode or hospitalization than those who were single (age, 29.35 vs 24.21). Married participants rated their quality of life higher than those who were single (mean Quality of Life Scale scores, 72.28 vs 53.87) and had less suicidal ideation than those who were divorced, widowed, or separated (7.4% vs 29.2%).
   CONCLUSIONS: In middle-aged and older individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and depressive symptoms, marriage appeared. to enhance quality of life and protect against suicidal ideation. Efforts that focus on providing additional support for those who are experiencing divorce or separation could prove to be lifesaving for these individuals.

AB Background: As a result of the post-9/11 GI Bill, increasing numbers of veterans are enrolling in college. However, little is known regarding suicidal outcomes among this group. In prior research, college student veterans reported high rates of suicidal ideation and attempt. Nonetheless, no research has examined whether military service is associated with increased suicide risk among college students. Aims: Our primary aims were to examine whether a history of military service was related to past-year suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt among college students. On the basis of previous research with college students, we hypothesized that students with a history of military service (i.e., current or prior) would report a higher percentage of past-year suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt. Our secondary aims were to examine the associations between military service and major depression and nonsuicidal self-injury. Method: Our sample included 3,290 college students with and without a history of military service who participated in the Healthy Minds Study in 2011 and 2012. Results: Military service was not significantly associated with past-year suicidal ideation, plan, or attempt. Students without a history of military service were more likely to report nonsuicidal self-injury. There was no significant difference in screening positive for major depression. Conclusions: These findings conflict with previous research that identified student veterans as being at elevated risk.

TI Changes in midlife death rates across racial and ethnic groups in the
   United States: systematic analysis of vital statistics
SO BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID LIFE EXPECTANCY; US COUNTIES; OVERDOSE DEATHS; MORTALITY; TRENDS;
   HEALTH; INEQUALITIES; AMERICANS; INCOME; DRUG
AB OBJECTIVE
   To systematically compare midlife mortality patterns in the United States across racial and ethnic groups during 1999-2016, documenting causes of death and their relative contribution to excess deaths.
   Design
   Trend analysis of US vital statistics among racial and ethnic groups.
   Setting
   United States, 1999-2016.
   Population
   US adults aged 25-64 years (midlife).
   Main outcome measures
   Absolute changes in mortality measured as average year-to-year change during 1999-2016 and 2012-16; excess deaths attributable to increasing mortality; and relative changes in mortality measured as relative difference between mortality in 1999 versus 2016 and the nadir year versus 2016, and the slope of modeled mortality trends for 1999-2016 and for intervals between joinpoints.
   Results
   During 1999-2016, all cause mortality in midlife increased not only among non-Hispanic (NH) whites but also among NH American Indians and Alaskan Natives. Although all cause mortality initially decreased among NH blacks, Hispanics, and NH Asians and Pacific Islanders, this trend ended in 2009-11. Drug overdoses were the leading cause of increased mortality in midlife in each population, but mortality also increased for alcohol related conditions, suicides, and organ diseases involving multiple body systems. Although midlife mortality among NH whites increased across a multitude of conditions, a similar trend affected non-white populations. Absolute (year-to-year) increases in midlife mortality among non-white populationsoften matched or exceeded those of NH whites, especially in 2012-16, when the rate of increase intensified for many causes of death. During 1999-2016, NH American Indians and Alaskan Natives experienced large increases in midlife mortality from 12 causes, not only drug overdoses (411.4%) but also hypertensive diseases (269.3%), liver cancer (115.1%), viral hepatitis (112.1%), and diseases of the nervous system (99.8%). NH blacks experienced increased midlife mortality from 17 causes, including drug overdoses (149.6%), homicides (21.4%), hypertensive diseases (15.5%), obesity (120.7%), and liver cancer (49.5%). NH blacks also experienced retrogression: after a period of stable or declining midlife mortality early in 1999-2016, death rates increased for alcohol related liver disease, chronic lower respiratory tract disease, suicides, diabetes, and pancreatic cancer. Among Hispanics, midlife mortality increased across 12 causes, including drug overdoses (80.0%), hypertensive diseases (40.6%), liver cancer (41.8%), suicides (21.9%), obesity (106.6%), and metabolic disorders (60.0%). Retrogression also occurred in this population; after a period of declining mortality, death rates increased for alcohol related liver disease, mental and behavioral disorders involving psychoactive substances, and homicides. NH Asians and Pacific Islanders were least affected by this trend but also experienced increases in midlife mortality from drug overdoses (300.6%), alcohol related liver disease (62.9%), hypertensive diseases (28.3%), and brain cancer (56.6%). The suicide rate in this group increased by 29.7% after 2001. The relative increase in US midlife mortality differed by sex and geography. For example, the relative increase in fatal drug overdoses was greater among women than among men. Although the relative increase in midlife mortality was generally greater in non-metropolitan (ie, rural) areas, the relative increase in drug overdoses among NH whites and Hispanics was greatest in suburban fringe areas of large cities, and among NH blacks was greatest in small cities.
   Conclusions
   Mortality in midlife in the US has increased across racial-ethnic populations for a variety of conditions, especially in recent years, offsetting years of progress in lowering mortality rates. This reversal carries added consequences for racial groups with high baseline mortality rates, such as for NH blacks and NH American Indians and Alaskan Natives. That death rates are increasing throughout the US population for dozens of conditions signals a systemic cause and warrants prompt action by policy makers to tackle the factors responsible for declining health in the US.

TI A protocol for consultation of another physician in cases of euthanasia

SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
DE euthanasia; assisted suicide; consultation; quality assurance; protocol
ID UNITED-STATES; NETHERLANDS
AB Objective-Consultation of another physician is an important method of review of the practice of euthanasia. For the project "support and consultation in euthanasia in Amsterdam" which is aimed at professionalising consultation, a protocol for consultation was developed to support the general practitioners who were going to work as consultants and to ensure uniformity.
   Participants-Ten experts (including general practitioners who were experienced in euthanasia and consultation, a psychiatrist, a social geriatrician, a professor in health law and a public prosecutor) and the general practitioners who were going to use the protocol.
   Evidence-There is limited literature on consultation: discursive articles and empirical studies describing the practice of euthanasia.
   Consensus-An initial draft on the basis of the literature was commented on by the experts and general practitioners in two rounds. Finally, the protocol was amended after it had been used during the training of consultants.
   Conclusions-The protocol differentiates between steps that are necessary in a consultation and steps that are recommended, Guidelines about four important aspects of consultation were given: independence, expertise, tasks and judgment of the consultant. In 97% of 109 consultations in which the protocol was used the consultant considered the protocol to be useful to a greater or lesser extent. Although this protocol was developed locally, it also employs universal principles. Therefore it can be of use in the development of consultation elsewhere.

AB This study examines mental health issues among women of different sexual orientations. An anonymous survey was administered at 33 health care sites across the United States; the sample (N=1304) included lesbians (n=524), bisexual (n=143) and heterosexual women (n=637). Not only did sexual orientation influence the probability of experiencing emotional stress, but also whether a bisexual woman or lesbian had disclosed her sexual orientation (was "out") impacted the likelihood of having or having had mental health problems. Bisexual women and lesbians experienced more emotional stress as teenagers than did heterosexual women. Bisexual women were more than twice as likely to have had an eating disorder compared to lesbians. If a bisexual woman reported being out she was twice as likely to have had an eating disorder compared to a heterosexual woman. Lesbians who were not out and bisexual women who were out were 2-2.5 times more likely to experience suicidal ideation in the past 12 months. Lesbians and bisexual women who were not out were more likely to have had a suicide attempt compared to heterosexual women. Lesbians used psychotherapy for depression more commonly than did heterosexual or bisexual women. This is one of the few studies that compares lesbians, bisexual and heterosexual women. The implications of these findings are discussed.

AB Cannabis legalization has led to significant health consequences, particularly to patients in emergency departments and hospitals in Colorado. The most concerning include psychosis, suicide, and other substance abuse. Deleterious effects on the brain include decrements in complex decision-making, which may not be reversible with abstinence. Increases in fatal motor vehicle collisions, adverse effects on cardiovascular and pulmonary systems, inadvertent pediatric exposures, cannabis contaminants exposing users to infectious agents, heavy metals, and pesticides, and hash-oil burn injuries in preparation of drug concentrates have been documented. Cannabis dispensary workers ("budtenders") without medical training are giving medical advice that may be harmful to patients. Cannabis research may offer novel treatment of seizures, spasticity from multiple sclerosis, nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy, chronic pain, improvements in cardiovascular outcomes, and sleep disorders. Progress has been slow due to absent standards for chemical composition of cannabis products and limitations on research imposed by federal classification of cannabis as illegal. Given these factors and the Colorado experience, other states should carefully evaluate whether and how to decriminalize or legalize non-medical cannabis use.

AB Purpose: To examine the chief causes and influences of morbidity and mortality among young people throughout the world.
   Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted that included WHO's Global Burden of Disease, UNFPA's State of the Worlds' Population, Medline, Popline, Sociological Abstracts, as well as data collected from UNICEF, UNAIDS, Population Reference Bureau, and the United Nations Headquarters. Experts in the fields of substance use, suicide, and infectious diseases were also contacted for unpublished and published sources. Studies were restricted to those completed after 1985, had a sample size of at least 100, focused primarily on the age group of 10-24 years, and examined trends related to unintentional injuries, HIV/AIDS, suicide, homicide, war, maternal mortality, pregnancy, abortion, sexually transmitted diseases, substance abuse, and infectious diseases.
   Results: Trends in adolescent morbidity and mortality have shifted over the past decade from predominately infectious to social etiologies. Currently, unintentional injury is the leading killer of young people in nearly every region of the world, with homicide, war, and interpersonal violence following closely behind.
   Conclusions: The changes in population, migration, age of marriage, and education have had profound impact on the mortality and morbidity among adolescents. As we come to learn about the factors that influence adolescent morbidity and mortality, we begin to have a better understanding of how to improve the health of youth throughout the world.

AB Physician-assisted suicide (PAS) is one of the most provocative topics facing society today. Given the great responsibility conferred on physicians by recent laws allowing PAS, a careful examination of this subject is warranted by psychiatrists and other specialists who may be consulted during a patient's request for PAS. In this article, recent evidence regarding the implementation of PAS in the United States and The Netherlands is reviewed. Support is found for some concerns about PAS, such as the possibility that mental illness occurs at higher rates in patients requesting PAS, but not for other concerns, such as the fear that PAS will be practiced more frequently on vulnerable populations (the slippery-slope argument). These data and common arguments for and against PAS are discussed with an emphasis on the tension between values, such as maximizing patient autonomy and adhering to professional obligations, as well as the need for additional research that focuses more directly on the patient-centered perspective. Implications of the available evidence are discussed and lead to a consideration of mental anguish in terminally ill patients including aspects of existential distress and an acknowledgment of the importance of tailoring end-of-life care to the distinct set of values and experiences that shape each patient's perspective. The article concludes with a discussion of an expanding role for psychiatrists in evaluating patients who request PAS.

AB Objectives: Depression in later life has potential grave implications and contributes to heavy emotional, medical, and economic burdens. Therefore, it is not surprising that identifying depression and its symptoms in later life has remained a sustained concern for professionals who treat older patients. Despite this concern, the current diagnostic gold standard may not identify depression symptoms equally well in older and younger adults. The objective of this analysis is to determine whether older and younger adults with equivalent levels of latent depression are equally likely to endorse particular DSM diagnostic symptoms. Method: We analyzed DSM depression data using Item Response Theory (IRT)-based differential item functioning analyses. The data came from 1808 older adults (age 65-98 years) and 3734 younger adults (age 18-34 years) who participated in the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcoholism and Related Conditions. Results: The analyses confirmed our hypothesis. The DSM items identify depression differently in younger and older adults. Specifically, results showed that older adults were more likely to endorse somatic items and less likely to endorse cognitive and suicide items than their younger counterparts with equivalent levels of depression. Conclusion: These findings provide evidence that the DSM depression items work differently across age groups when controlling for latent depression. It is important to consider, however, that these findings are limited by the sampling methodology and the particular protocol implemented.

AB Adolescents in Puerto Rico are at an increased risk for suicide attempts, though evidence-based treatments specifically for this group have not been tested. The current study was designed to develop and pilot test a culturally sensitive, manualized outpatient treatment for Puerto Rican adolescents who have experienced a suicidal crisis. The study was divided into phases. Phase 1 consisted of developing a socio-cognitive behavioral treatment for suicidal behavior. Phase 2 tested the treatment protocol in an open trial with 11 (6 male and 5 female) Puerto Rican adolescents. Active treatment had an approximate duration of 3-6 months. An initial assessment, process measures, and posttreatment assessment were completed with each participant to measure treatment feasibility as well as suicidality, symptoms, and risk factors. Participants were very satisfied with treatment and reported relevant clinical benefits. The retention rate was 73% (8 out of 11). For those who completed the treatment protocol, the goal of reducing further suicide risk was achieved; 2 showed reliable clinical changes in suicidal ideation, while 6 maintained low levels during treatment. All treatment completers had either a partial or total remission of their pretreatment diagnosis and half had reliable improvements in at least 1 risk factor. A theory-driven treatment protocol was developed according to patient's needs, but further research is needed to continue its development and to explore its efficacy.

   AUSTRALIA
AB The 20th anniversary of the National Firearms Agreement (NFA) offers lessons for mental health and public health. Along with similar international legislation, the NFA exemplifies how firearms regulation can prevent firearm mortality and injuries.
   The gun lobby claims that mental illness underpins gun violence and should be a key site for intervention.
   A modest but significant link exists between mental disorders and community violence. However, the vast majority of mentally ill individuals are not violent. Despite media portrayals of their dangerousness, they are more likely to be victims of violence and of suicide.
   Most violent individuals do not have mental illness, and most mass murderers do not have identifiable severe mental illness. Many have maladaptive personality configurations. Gun availability and gun ownership, not severe mental illness, determines most gun homicides.
   Following recent gun massacres in the United States, there have been calls for better resourcing of mental health services to help identify and respond to those at risk and to regulate firearms access.
   Screening mentally ill populations for violence risk is misguided. However, clinicians can play a key role in working with legal authorities to monitor and assist regulation of firearm access, especially among high risk populations.
   Clinician involvement must be complemented by wider gun control measures. The gun lobby's turning the firearms availability debate into a question about whether people with mental illness histories should access such weapons is a calculated appeal to prejudice.

AB Objective: The authors assessed the prevalence of gun availability for elderly patients to determine whether gun availability is related to the presence of suicidal or depressive symptoms. Methods: This is a cross-sectional epidemiologic survey of firearm availability and safety practices, A random sample of older adults with a scheduled primary-care clinic appointment was selected and screened with the General Health Questionnaire and questions about suicidality and alcohol use. Participants were also asked about the availability of firearms in their home and about safe gun practices, Results: Of 1,023 patients screened, 285 (27.9%) reported having some type of firearm in the home, and 202 (19.7%) reported having a handgun in the home. Patients with suicidal ideation or high levels of depression or psychological distress were not significantly more or less likely to have a gun in the home than those without these emotional stressors. The strongest predictors of firearm availability were being male and being married. Conclusions: These preliminary data suggest that a significant proportion of elderly people have firearms available to them in their homes, Those patients with emotional distress did not differ from those without distress with respect to having firearms available to them. These data strongly suggest the need for screening for firearm availability and education about the safe storage of firearms as a potential means of prevention of suicide among elderly patients suffering from emotional distress or suicidal ideation.

AB Purpose: Assisted death practices such as physician-assisted suicide (PAS) and active voluntary euthanasia (AVE) are becoming more acceptable to the public and the medical profession. This study compared the attitudes and practices of resident house staff physicians with the medical staff physicians responsible for teaching them regarding PAS and AVE. Methods: A convenience sample of 372 medical staff and 105 resident house staff from a multi-residency community teaching hospital were anonymously surveyed. The overall response rate was 47%. The questionnaire consisted of 10 questions that examined the subjects 'professional and legal values, willingness to participate in assisted death practices, and personal preferences for assisted death practices. Results: The resident house staff differed significantly from the medical staff in attitudes toward assisted death practices. The resident house staff was less likely to support the traditional prohibitions against PAS and AVE. The resident house staff was also more likely to offer assisted death practices if they were legal. There was no significant difference, however; in the participation of assisted death practices between the groups respectively for PAS and AVE. The residents were more likely to request PAS or AVE for themselves or family members. Conclusions: There are significant differences in attitudes and practices between resident physicians and medical staff physicians concerning PAS and AVE. These differences could lead to professional conflicts when setting clinical goals for end-of-life care and could compromise patient care.

ID REPORTING SYSTEM; GUN; PREVENTION; HOMICIDE; INJURY; LAWS
AB We examined the accuracy of data on unintentional firearm fatalities in the United States. We began with data from the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) and examined every firearm death reported as an accident by any NVDRS data source - the NVDRS abstracter, the State Vital Statistics Registry (i.e., the ICD-10 Underlying Cause of Death code and manner of death from the death certificate), the medical examiner or coroner report, and the police Supplementary Homicide Report. After carefully reading the information from all sources, we then classified each case as either unintentional or intentional using NVDRS definitions.
   Comparing our classification with that of the NVDRS abstracter, we conclude that NVDRS data accurately report unintentional firearm deaths (sensitivity 98%; positive predictive value [PPV] 99%). We then compared our classification with that of the State Vital Statistics Registry based on the ICD-10 Underlying Cause of Death code and found great inaccuracy (sensitivity 62%; PPV 58%). Thirty-eight percent of true cases were missed and 42% of reported cases were false positives. As has been previously reported in the literature, over half of unintentional shootings that were inflicted by another person were classified as homicides, not accidents. This is a particular problem for the data on young victims. What was unexpected, however, was the opposite problem: we found many unambiguous suicides and homicides that were reported as accidents. We believe this is due to the ICD-10 coding practice of assigning injury deaths to the "accident" category when manner of death is "pending" or left blank.
   Finally, at the state-level, we compared our overall results for each state and year with the official National Vital Statistics System count (reported on CDC's WONDER website). We found evidence of even greater over-reporting of unintentional firearm deaths there.
   In answer to the question, "Are there too many or too few unintentional firearm deaths in official mortality data?" the best answer is, "Both." Many true accidents are missed, while many suicides and homicides are mistakenly reported as accidents. By contrast, the NVDRS applies a case definition for unintentional firearm deaths with consistency and accuracy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background Despite prevention programs, a rising incidence of sexually transmitted infections is currently reported in France.
   Aims Research factors associated with risky sexual behaviors (RSBs) among the French population.
   Methods Subjects aged 15-54 years from the French national survey 'Barome` tre sante '2010' were included (n = 16 598). RSB was defined as having multiple partners or failure to use condom at first intercourse with a new partner over past 12 months. Factors associated were identified using one logistic regression by gender.
   Results The overall RSB prevalence was 9.5%, being higher among men (P<0.001). Factors associated with RSB for both genders were young age (OR = 1.5), single status (men: OR = 7.1; women: OR = 6.4), homosexual relations (men: OR = 2.0; women: OR = 3.2), low incomes (men: OR = 1.5; women: OR = 1.4), use of cannabis (men: OR = 1.4; women: OR = 3.0). Men-specific factors were history of STI (OR = 2.5) and alcohol drunkenness (OR = 2.2), and women-specific factors history of suicide attempt (OR = 1.6) and history of sexual assault (OR = 1.6).
   Conclusions Confirming most of known determinants of RSB, this study also identified some specific risky patterns for whom preventive actions can be developed: multiusers of psychoactive substances, people living with low incomes, women having sex with women or presenting history of psychological vulnerability (suicide attempts, sexually harassed).

AB Our study's objective is to determine whether substance use disorders' association with aggression differs according to the type of substance and/or the form of aggression, within the same population. We used data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health across 2008-2014, with a pooled sample of 270,227 adult respondents. We used regression models to estimate the odds ratios for those having alcohol and/or drug use disorder(s) perpetrating (a) each form of aggression compared with no aggression and (b) other-directed compared with self-directed aggression. Alcohol use disorder alone and drug use disorder(s) alone were both associated with significantly increased odds of committing self-directed, other-directed, and combined aggression. Individuals with drug use disorder(s) alone were more likely to commit other-directed than self-directed aggression (adjusted odds ratio = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.04-2.05). Individuals with alcohol use disorder alone were not likely to commit one over the other (adjusted odds ratio = 1.20, 95% CI = 0.90-1.61). In conclusion, the integrated model of aggression based on the stress-diathesis model is a relevant framework to study risk factors for aggression. Further research is needed to identify longitudinal predictors of directionality of aggression.

AB Background: Alcohol abuse and/or dependence, alcohol use disorders (AUDs), and problem and/or pathological gambling (PPG) frequently co-occur with each other and other psychiatric disorders. However, prior studies have not investigated the relative influence of AUDs on the associations between PPG and other psychiatric disorders.
   Methods: Nationally representative data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (n=43,093; United-States residents >= 18 years of age) was used to examine the influence of AUDs on the associations between gambling and other psychiatric disorders and behaviors. The main outcome measures were co-occurrence of past-year AUD and Axis I and II disorders and severity of gambling based on the 10 inclusionary diagnostic criteria for pathological gambling.
   Results: Among non-AUD respondents, increasing gambling severity was associated with increasingly elevated odds for the majority of Axis I and 11 disorders. Among AUD respondents, this pattern was typically not observed. Alcohol-by-gambling-group interactions for PPG were also found and the odds of these disorders was significantly increased in non-AUD respondents with PPG, but either unchanged or significantly lower in AUD respondents with PPG.
   Conclusions: Gambling-related associations exist with multiple psychiatric disorders, but particularly in those without AUD. These associations have important implications with respect to conceptualization, prevention, and treatment of psychiatric disorders in individuals with gambling and/or AUDs.

AB IMPORTANCE Suicides and attempted suicides are major public health issues in the United States and around the world. Self-inflicted gunshot wounds (SIGSWs) are a common method of attempting suicide, the head being the most commonly injured body region; however, the literature lacks an overview of the orbital and ocular injuries as well as outcomes associated with SIGSWs.
   OBJECTIVES To characterize the ocular and orbital injuries and outcomes of patients presenting with SIGSWs and to examine the cost associated with these injuries.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective medical record review was performed of all patients who presented to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics between 2003 to 2013 with the admitting diagnosis of self-inflicted injuries via firearms. Patients with no periorbital or ocular injuries and/or those who did not survive for at least 2 months following the incident were excluded.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Ocular injuries and outcomes and health care costs and reimbursements, which were generated by a financial report obtained from the hospital finance department that included data from both the hospital billing and cost accounting systems.
   RESULTS All patients in this study (n = 18) were men with a mean age of 47.2 years. Eight patients (44.4%) displayed submental missile entry points, 7 (38.9%) displayed intraoral entry points, and 3 (16.7%) displayed pericranial entry points. Patients with pericranial entries sustained more severe ocular injuries and had poorer ocular outcomes. Seven patients (38.9%) were found at final follow-up to have visual acuity of 20/40 or better in each eye and all showed missile trajectories in the sagittal plane. The mean cost of treatment of these patients totaled $117 338 while the mean reimbursement amount was $124 388.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Data regarding ocular injuries and outcomes may assist ophthalmologists in the treatment of patients with SIGSWs in the future. Many patients had extremely functional vision at final follow-ups, which highlights the importance of specialists conducting examinations and reconstructive procedures promptly, carefully, and thoroughly. Cost and reimbursement data suggest that while these cases place a large financial burden on society, they may not burden hospital systems in the same way.

AB The general fertility rate in 2005 was 66.7 births per 1000 women aged 15 to 44 years, the highest level since 1993. The birth rate for teen mothers (aged 15 to 19 years) declined by 2% between 2004 and 2005, falling to 40.4 births per 1000 women, the lowest ever recorded in the 65 years for which there are consistent data. The birth rates for women >= 30 years of age rose in 2005 to levels not seen in almost 40 years. Childbearing by unmarried women also increased to historic record levels for the United States in 2005. The cesarean-delivery rate rose by 4% in 2005 to 30.2% of all births, another record high. The preterm birth rate continued to rise (to 12.7% in 2005), as did the rate for low birth weight births (8.2%). The infant mortality rate was 6.79 infant deaths per 1000 live births in 2004, not statistically different from the rate in 2003. Pronounced differences in infant mortality rates by race and Hispanic origin continue, with non-Hispanic black newborns more than twice as likely as non-Hispanic white and Hispanic infants to die within 1 year of birth. The expectation of life at birth reached a record high in 2004 of 77.8 years for all gender and race groups combined. Death rates in the United States continued to decline, with death rates decreasing for 9 of the 15 leading causes. The crude death rate for children aged 1 to 19 years did not decrease significantly between 2003 and 2004. Of the 10 leading causes of death for 2004 in this age group, only the rates for influenza and pneumonia showed a significant decrease. The death rates increased for intentional self-harm ( suicide), whereas rates for other causes did not change significantly for children. A large proportion of childhood deaths continue to occur as a result of preventable injuries.

AB To compare, from the perspective of third-party payers in the United States health care system, the cost-effectiveness of olanzapine long-acting injection (LAI, depot) with alternative antipsychotic agents including risperidone-LAI, paliperidone-LAI, haloperidol-LAI, and oral olanzapine, in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia who have been non-adherent or partially adherent with oral antipsychotics.
   A 1-year micro-simulation economic decision model was developed to simulate the dynamics of usual care of patients with schizophrenia who continue, discontinue, switch, or restart their medication. The model uses a range of clinical and cost parameters including adherence levels, relapse with and without hospitalization, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), treatment discontinuation rates by reason, treatment-emergent adverse events, suicide, health care resource utilization, and direct health care costs. Published medical literature and a clinical expert panel were used to develop baseline model assumptions.
   Key model outputs include annual total direct cost (US$$) per treatment and incremental cost-effectiveness values per additional QALY gained.
   Model results found that the olanzapine-LAI treatment strategy was more effective (greater QALYs) and less costly than risperidone-LAI, paliperidone-LAI, and haloperidol-LAI. In addition, olanzapine-LAI was both more effective and more costly, with an estimated incremental cost/QALY of $$26,824 compared to oral olanzapine. The base-case and multiple sensitivity analyses found olanzapine-LAI to remain within acceptable cost-effective ranges (<$$50,000) in terms of incremental cost/QALY gained.
   This micro-simulation model finds the olanzapine-LAI treatment strategy to result in better effectiveness and to be a cost-effective alternative compared to oral olanzapine and the LAI formulations of risperidone, paliperidone, and haloperidol in the treatment of non-adherent and partially adherent patients with schizophrenia in the United States. A key limitation is the assumption how LAI therapies compare to oral counterparts due to sparse head-to-head data. Further research is needed to verify baseline assumptions.

AB A number of studies use the Age Period Cohort Characteristic (APCC) model to address the impact of cohort related factors on the age distribution of homicide offending. Several of these studies treat birth cohorts as spanning several years, an operationalization that most closely matches tenets of cohort theory, yet sharply reduces the number of observations available for analysis. Other studies de ne birth cohorts as those born within a single year, an operationalization that is theoretically problematic, but provides many more observations for analysis. We address the sample size problem by applying a time-series-cross-section model ( panel model) with age-period-specific homicide arrest data from the United States for each year from 1960 to 1999, while operationalizing cohorts as five-year birth cohorts. Our panel model produces results that are very similar to those obtained from traditional multiyear APCC models. Substantively, the results provide a replication of work showing the importance of relative cohort size and cohort variations in family structure for explaining variations in age-period-specific homicide rates. The additional observations provided by our approach allow us to examine these relationships over time, and we find substantively important changes. The year-by-year estimates of the age distribution of homicide offending help us to examine the model during the epidemic of youth homicide.

AB OBJECTIVE: With recent increasing rates of medical student and physician suicide, there has been a focus on examining depression in medical providers and trainees, particularly surgical residents. However, there is a paucity of data specific to orthopedic surgery. Our goal was to evaluate the mental health status of current trainees across North America in order to determine whether or not there were specific demographic or program characteristics correlated with improved mental health scores.
   DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was developed and administered to collect basic demographic information as well as residency program qualities. The Mental Health Inventory 5 (MHI-5) was used to assess depression and anxiety in study participants. We then evaluated the associations between various resident and program characteristics and depression scores with a p value set at <0.05 for significance.
   SETTING: Orthopedic Surgery residency programs across the United States and Canada. Surveys were distributed to 44 programs and responses were received from 41 of those programs.
   PARTICIPANTS: An anonymous survey was distributed to Orthopedic Surgery residents across the United States and Canada; participation in the survey was voluntary and free of coercion. We received a total of 279 responses from 41 institutions across North America.
   RESULTS: The mean MHI-5 score of all respondents was 71.5 (range 8.0-100). Women, PGY2 and PGY3 residents and those working >80 hours per week were found to have significantly lower MHI-5 scores. Greater MHI-5 scores were seen in respondents who felt their program offered them an adequate level of surgical independence, case volume/variety, mentorship, and educational opportunities as well as adequate resources to deal with personal or work-related issues.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the prevalence of low-level depression in United States and Canadian orthopedic surgery residents. Additionally, we identified several characteristics that residency programs may focus on to help prevent burnout and depression in trainees. ((C) 2019 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

AB Background: Household food insecurity and mental disorders are both prevalent conditions among children and adolescents (i.e., youth) in the United States. Although some research has examined the association between the 2 conditions, it is not known whether more severe food insecurity is differently associated with mental disorders in youth.
   Objective: We investigated the association between severity of household food insecurity and mental disorders among children (aged 4-11 y) and adolescents (aged 12-17 y) using valid and reliable measures of both household food security status and mental disorders.
   Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data on 16,918 children and 14,143 adolescents whose families participated in the 20112014 National Health Interview Survey. The brief Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the 10-item USDA Household Food Security Survey Module were used to measure mental disorders and food security status, respectively. Multinomial logistic regressions were used to test the association between household food security status and mental disorders in youth.
   Results: There was a significant linear trend in ORs, such that as severity of household food insecurity increased so did the odds of youth having a mental disorder (P < 0.001). Other selected results included the following: compared with food secure households, youth in marginally food-secure households had higher odds of having a mental disorder with impairment [child OR: 1.26 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.52); adolescent OR: 1.33 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.68)]. In addition, compared with food-secure households, youth in very-low-food-secure households had higher odds of having a mental disorder with severe impairment [child OR: 2.55 (95% CI: 1.90, 3.43); adolescent OR: 3.44 (95% CI: 2.50, 4.75)].
   Conclusions: The severity of household food insecurity is positively associated with mental disorders among both children and adolescents in the United States. These results suggest that improving household food security status has the potential to reduce mental disorders among US youth.

AB BACKGROUND:Stigmatizing attitudes toward mental illness and low mental health literacy have been identified as links to social adversity, and barriers to seeking and adhering to treatment among adolescents suffering from mental illness. Prior research has found that it is possible to improve these outcomes using school-based mental health awareness interventions. The purpose of this study was to review empirical literature pertaining to universal mental health awareness interventions aiming to improve mental health related outcomes among students enrolled in US K-12 schools, especially minorities vulnerable to health disparities.
   METHODS:PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, PUBMED, and reference lists of relevant articles were searched for K-12 school-based mental health awareness interventions in the United States. Universal studies that measured knowledge, attitudes, and/or help-seeking pertinent to mental health were included.
   RESULTS:A total of 15 studies were selected to be part of the review. There were 7 pretest/post-test case series, 5 nonrandomized experimental trial, 1 Solomon 4-groups, and 2 randomized controlled trial (RCT) designs. Nine studies measuring knowledge, 8 studies measuring attitudes, and 4 studies measuring help-seeking, indicated statistically significant improvements.
   CONCLUSIONS:Although results of all studies indicated some level of improvement, more research on implementation of universal school-based mental health awareness programs is needed using RCT study designs, and long-term follow-up implementation.

AB Objective. Synthesize evidence on effectiveness of interventions designed to improve access to health services by indigenous populations.
   Methods. Review of systematic reviews published as of July 2015, selecting and analyzing only studies in the Region of the Americas. The bibliographic search encompassed MEDLINE, Lilacs, SciELO, EMBASE, DARE, HTA, The Cochrane Library, and organization websites. Two independent reviewers selected studies and analyzed their methodological quality. A narrative summary of the results was produced.
   Results. Twenty-two reviews met the inclusion criteria. All selected studies were conducted in Canada and the United States of America. The majority of the interventions were preventive, to surmount geographical barriers, increase use of effective measures, develop human resources, and improve people's skills or willingness to seek care. Topics included pregnancy, cardiovascular risk factors, diabetes, substance abuse, child development, cancer, mental health, oral health, and injuries. Some interventions showed effectiveness with moderate or high quality studies: educational strategies to prevent depression, interventions to prevent childhood caries, and multicomponent programs to promote use of child safety seats. In general, results for chronic non-communicable diseases were negative or inconsistent.
   Conclusions. Interventions do exist that have potential for producing positive effects on access to health services by indigenous populations in the Americas, but available studies are limited to Canada and the U.S. There is a significant research gap on the topic in Latin America and the Caribbean.

AB The burden of mental illness is profound and growing. Coupled with large gaps in extant psychiatric services, this mental health burden has often forced emergency departments (EDs) to become the de facto primary and acute care provider of mental health care in the United States. An expanded emergency medical and mental health research agenda is required to meet the need for improved education, screening, surveillance, and ED-initiated interventions for mental health problems. As an increasing fraction of undiagnosed and untreated psychiatric patients passes through the revolving doors of U.S. EDs, the opportunities for improving the art and science of acute mental health care have never been greater. These opportunities span macroepidemiologic surveillance research to intervention studies with individual patients. Feasible screening, intervention, and referral programs for mental health patients presenting to general EDs are needed. Additional research is needed to improve the quality of care, including the attitudes, abilities, interests, and virtues of ED providers. Research that optimizes provider education and training can help academic settings validate psychosocial issues as core components and responsibilities of emergency medicine. Transdisciplinary research with federal partners and investigators in neuropsychiatry and related fields can improve the mechanistic understanding of acute mental health problems. To have lasting impact, however, advances in ED mental health care must be translated into real-world policies and sustainable program enhancements to assure the uptake of best practices for ED screening, treatment, and management of mental disorders and psychosocial problems.

AB P>Purpose:
   To estimate the prevalence of neuropsychiatric and pain disorders in adults with epilepsy in the United States.
   Methods:
   In 2008, an 11-item survey including validated questions to screen for a lifetime history of epilepsy was mailed to 340,000 households from two national panels selected to be generally representative of the noninstitutionalized U.S. population. Information on epilepsy and other disorders was collected from 172,959 respondents aged 18 or older. Propensity scoring was used to match respondents with and without epilepsy on baseline characteristics and risk factors for epilepsy. Prevalence ratios (PRs) of comorbidities in respondents with epilepsy were calculated using log-binomial generalized linear models. Comorbidities were categorized as neuropsychiatric (anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, sleep disorder/apnea, and movement disorder/tremor), pain (migraine headache, chronic pain, fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain), and other (asthma, diabetes, and high blood pressure).
   Key Findings:
   Two percent (3,488) of respondents reported ever having been told they had epilepsy or a seizure disorder. Respondents with self-reported epilepsy were more likely (p < 0.001) than those without epilepsy to report all six neuropsychiatric disorders (PR from 1.27-2.39), all four pain disorders (PR 1.36-1.96), and asthma (PR 1.25).
   Significance:
   Neuropsychiatric conditions and pain disorder comorbidities were reported more often in individuals with self-reported epilepsy than in those without epilepsy. Identification of these conditions is an important consideration in the clinical management of epilepsy.

AB Purpose: We provide an update in the literature and national regulations regarding electronic cigarettes with special attention to the pediatric population.
   Background: Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) are handheld battery operated devices that vaporize nicotine-containing liquids for inhalation. Use of these products has dramatically increased over the last several years, particularly among the youth. ENDS are being marketed with advertising techniques and flavors which appeal to the adolescent and young adult population. More reports of accidental pediatric exposures are being documented, as are suicides from abuse of liquid nicotine. Federal regulation has only now become required of these devices.
   Conclusion: Use of e cigarettes among adolescents increases each year. Government oversight is needed to protect our children from the re-normalization of tobacco. Otolaryngologists should be prepared to counsel their patients and families regarding the latest in ENDS use. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined the potential utility of adding items that assessed youths' emotional and behavioral disorders to a commonly used surveillance survey. The goal was to evaluate whether the added items could enhance understanding of youths' involvement in high-risk behaviors. A sample of 3,331 adolescents in Grades 8, 10, and 12 from four California school districts were coadministered a mental health screener and a youth surveillance survey. Items from both tools assessing chronic sadness and elevated mental health risk were significantly associated with increased risk of suicide ideation, cigarette use, alcohol use, binge drinking, marijuana use, physical fighting, being threatened or injured with a weapon, and skipping school. However, the addition of mental health content to the surveillance survey increased precision of understanding which youths were at the greatest odds of engaging in risk behaviors. Implications for practice and policy are discussed.

AB Religious and spiritual factors are increasingly being examined in psychiatric research. Religious beliefs and practices have long been linked to hysteria, neurosis, and psychotic delusions. However, recent studies have identified another side of religion that may serve as a psychological and social resource for coping with stress. After defining the terms religion and spirituality, this paper reviews research on the relation between religion and (or) spirituality, and mental health, focusing on depression, suicide, anxiety, psychosis, and substance abuse. The results of an earlier systematic review are discussed, and more recent studies in the United States, Canada, Europe, and other countries are described. While religious beliefs and practices can represent powerful sources of comfort, hope, and meaning, they are often intricately entangled with neurotic and psychotic disorders, sometimes making it difficult to determine whether they are a resource or a liability.

AB Major depressive disorder in children and adolescents is associated with high risk of suicide and persistent functional impairment. While psychological treatments are used as a first line treatment in mild and moderately severe depression in this age group, the number of prescriptions for antidepressant medication (SSRI) has grown in recent years. Recently, FDA and MHRA advised that most of SSRI should not be used to treat MDD under the age of 18 years. They may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and self harm. We reviewed the recent literature on efficacy and suicide risks of SSRI in depressed young people. Conflicting findings of SSRI efficacy have been reported in clinical studies. The discrepancies could be related to the heterogeneous samples and the absence of a standard definition of treatment effectiveness. In randomised placebo-controlled antidepressant clinical trials (RCT), the assessment of treatment effectiveness is commonly made with the CDRS-R (improvement of 20 % or 30 % or 40 %) and CGI. SSRI demonstrated significantly, but modest, improvement compared with placebo in CGI score of 1 or 2: 10 % more for sertraline, 16.8 % more for paroxetine and between 16 to 24 % more for fluoxetine. In adults, RCT studies have shown placebo response rates of 30 % to 50 %, drug response rates of 45 % to 50 % and drug-placebo differences of 18 % to 25 %. The highest placebo response rates, in young people, maybe related to the highly selected group not representative of the general population of depressed patients and/or to the high youths' sensibility of psychotherapy. Patients participating in antidepressant clinical trials have a low BDI and CDI in Emslie's study for example (2002). In adults, previous reports suggest that SSRI use is associated with increased suicidal risk. But the analyse of 48 277 depressed patients participating in RCT for nine FDA approved antidepressants fail to support an overall difference in suicide risk between antidepressants (SSRI) and placebo treated subjects (32). An inverse relationship between regional change in use of antidepressants (increased) and suicide (decreased) is found in young people in United States from 1990 and 2000 (44). We can not draw a conclusion from few studies with few participants. None suicide have been reported in pharmacological studies. And the link between,, suicidality,, and MDD can not be excluded. The instruments of assessment in depressed young patients are based on extensions of adult procedures. Whereas clinical picture of MDD in children, adolescents and adults have some differences. Depressed youngsters have more pronounced mood lability. Depressed adolescents have more anhedonia than depressed children. Future investigations into the efficacy and safety of treatments for children and adolescents depression should use specific instruments directly built on phenomenological and clinical picture of depressed children and adolescents. Comparison studies of pharmacotherapy, specific psychotherapies (not only CBT) and combined therapies are necessary to identify the adolescents who will benefit the most from specific or combined therapies. Further studies into the factors that influence treatment outcome including clinical picture (clinical dimensions, severity, duration, co morbidity), genetic factor, age, and illness course may help identify appropriate treatments for children and adolescents with MDD. Studies should include patients more severely ill, with associated psychiatric troubles, treatment resistance, history of relapses...
   In clinical studies, the link btween,, suicidality, and some clinical dimensions (Which take part In clinical picture or not) must be analysed by assessing anhedonia, hopelessness feel, impulsive trait, borderline personality, familial interaction, biological indices. New treatment should be expand and their efficacy and safety must be study : St John's worth, Bright light therapy, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. In practice: suicide and MDD have a strongest relation and it must be investigate systematically during the course of MDD. The suicide risk increases in the context of past history of suicide attempts, hopelessness, psychosis, impulsivity traits, substance abuse, familial dysfunction, life events, open access of arms. The use of SSRI in depressed children and adolescents is also the question of the quality and the support of the consultant and the mode of the prescription.

AB This article describes U.S. income inequality and 100-year national and 30-year regional trends in age- and cause-specific mortality. There is little congruence between national trends in income inequality and age- or cause-specific mortality except perhaps for suicide and homicide. The variable trends in some causes of mortality may be associated regionally with income inequality. However, between 1978 and 2000 those regions experiencing the largest increases in income inequality had the largest declines in mortality (r = 0.81, p < 0.001). Understanding the social determinants of population health requires appreciating how broad indicators of social and economic conditions are related, at different times and places, to the levels and social distribution of major risk factors for particular health outcomes.

AB Education is negatively associated with most major causes of death. Prior work ignores the premise that cause-specific hazards are interdependent and that both education and mortality depend on cognitive ability. We analyse Swedish men aged 18-63, focusing on months lost due to specific causeswhich solves the interdependence problemand use a structural model that accounts for confounding due to cognitive ability. In a standard Cox model controlling for Intelligence Quotient, improving education is associated with large decreases in mortality for major causes of death. In the structural model, improving education is associated with a small decrease in months lost for most causes and education levels. Among the least educated, however, improving education strongly reduces the months lost, mainly those lost from external causes, such as accidents and suicide. Results suggest that conventional analysis of education and mortality may be biased, even if accounting for observed cognition.

AB As most studies on terrorism have placed an emphasis on the terrorist attacks against the United States or European countries, the authors have designed an unprecedented research that instead examines fatal and nonfatal attacks in East and South Asia. Eight terrorist groups are selected and the attacks carried out by them from 2000 to 2011 are analyzed. Through the analysis, the authors have found that secular terrorism is most common in East and South Asia, while the terrorist groups targeting Western countries are rooted in religious terrorism. In addition, almost seven out of ten attacks in East and South Asia have led to fatalities. Furthermore, there was a terrorism boom from 2005 to 2008 in East and South Asia, and international cooperation is contributing to the declining number of terrorist attacks in these regions. Policy implications and limitations are also discussed.

ID PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE; ATTITUDES; AGE; PERIOD; END
AB Studying the role of social change, I investigated trends in approval for euthanasia between cohorts in the United States and how those trends are influenced by cohort replacement and religious attitudes. Using 16 waves from the General Social Survey (1985 to 2014; n = 6,638), I estimated differences in approval ratings between cohorts using logistic regression models. Models accounted for religious preference, religiosity, age, sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, marital status, and political ideology. Members of the baby boomer cohort are significantly more likely to approve of euthanasia than either their predecessors or successors, suggesting a cohort effect. Individuals who belong to more conservative religious groups and display higher levels of religiosity are less likely to approve. Cohort has a meaningful effect on approval of euthanasia, successors to the baby boomer cohort might increase their approval as their religiosity decreases and their parents and grandparents increasingly face end-of-life decisions.

AB Messner and Rosenfeld's institutional anomie theory is grounded in the assumption that relatively higher crime rates in the United States are due to (1) the overwhelming influence of economic motives and institutions in society, and (2) the subjugation of all other social institutions to cultural economic interests (e.g., the American Dream). Our analysis is designed to extend the limited body of empirical research on this theory in several ways. First, we seek to test the utility of institutional anomie theory for predicting crime rates across aggregate units within the United States (counties). Second, we draw out the theory's emphasis on instrumental crime and suggest that measures of noneconomic social, political, familial, religious, and educational institutions will be particularly relevant for explaining instrumental as opposed to expressive violence. Third, in contrast to prior research, we develop conceptual reasons to expect that these factors will primarily mediate (as opposed to moderate) the relationship between economically motivating pressures and instrumental violence. Our negative binomial regression analyses of data from the Supplementary Homicide Reports and various censuses indicate that the measures of noneconomic institutions perform well in explaining both instrumental and expressive homicides, but that these measures mediate the impact of economic pressures (as measured by the Gini coefficient of family income inequality) to commit instrumental violence most strongly. Further, we find only very limited support for the more popular moderation hypothesis.

AB Filicide occurs in every socioeconomic stratum around the world. This study was conducted to evaluate motives, psychopathological aspects, and socio-demographic factors of 74 filicide cases of women in Turkey. Mean age of mothers, most of whom committed infanticide, was 26years, and breakdown of criminal offenses are as follows: to get rid of unwanted babies (24.3%), acute psychotic-type filicide (21.6%), fatal child abuse and neglect (17.6%), to get revenge (12.2%), protect the lonely child from the harm and badness after suicide (10.8%), and pity (9.5%) motives. Results showed that maternal filicide cannot be reduced to only mental instability or environmental factors and indicates deficiencies in the capacity of the mothers' role in connecting with their child and with parenting skills. Finally, with regard to defendants' motives, similar factors that contribute to committing maternal filicide should be considered while making an assessment of the data and determining employee risk groups.

AB Adolescent suicidal behavior poses a major global public health concern as it is highly prevalent and associated with mortality and morbidity worldwide. Substanceuse disorders are also an issue of increasing concern among adolescents and have been shown to increase the risk for suicidal behaviors. In this review we address emerging issues in the relationship between adolescent substance use disorders and suicidal behaviors. We focus on common hazardous patterns of substance abuse such as binge drinking and poly-substance abuse and point out developing patterns of substance preferences as evidenced by the contemporary widespread use of synthetic cannabinoids. We address these issues in the context of vulnerable populations such as sexual-minority adolescents and youth with co-occurring mental-disorder diagnoses. Finally, we relate to the present and future challenges presented by these issues to implement effective anti-suicidal treatment and prevention strategies in adolescents with substance use disorders.

AB Despite the successful growth of the hospice movement during the past 30 years in the United States, almost 85% of Americans continue to die in hospitals or nursing homes. While the benefits of palliative care principles are well established, palliative care interventions remain underused in clinical practice in the settings in which most Americans die. Our premise is that physicians as a group perpetuate end-of-life suffering rather than ease the transition from life to death. We also believe that maintaining quality of life (QOL) at the end of life requires a multidimensional approach orchestrated by physicians drawing on the full range of available physical, psychological, social, and spiritual interventions, This article defines the meaning of QOL at the end of life and then examines the ramifications of failing to attend to QOL concerns in dying patients. It reviews strategies that physicians can use to advance palliative care approaches, thereby reducing terminally ill patients' suffering in the institutions in which most die.

AB There is a reported increase of intentional seroconversion in the United States over the past several years in the gay community (Crossley, 2004; Trinufol, 2003). This article reports on a sample (n = 24) of men who identify their motivations behind their pursuit of seroconversion. Respondents were asked to identify what motivations were connected to their attempt to become seropositive. Three general variables emerged as potential indicators: (1) seeking relief from emotional HIV fatigue, (2) the wish to be closer with one's HIV positive partner, and (3) the expectation to become HIV positive. By identifying these possible motivations (both psychological and sociocultural), sex educators and therapists providing counseling to the gay male community may be better equipped to more effectively identify clients at high risk for intentional seroconversion. Recommendations for assessment and intervention with those at high risk for such behaviors are provided by the authors.

AB Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic medication commonly used to treat psychotic illnesses in adults. It is being used with increasing frequency in children and adolescents, even though it has yet to be approved for use in this population by the Food and Drug Administration. There are few reports in the literature regarding its safety in those younger than 18 years of age. We present the case of a 15-year-old who ingested 110 mg of risperidone in a suicide attempt and developed only transient lethargy, hypotension, and tachycardia without any other significant effects. We review the literature regarding risperidone overdose in all age groups and review the current literature regarding pediatric overdose with the other atypical antipsychotics currently available in the United States. From those cases it seems that special care may be warranted with all pediatric cases of atypical antipsychotic overdose, including monitoring in a high-intensity clinical setting to manage potential respiratory or cardiac difficulties.

AB No previous studies have examined suicide risk among Central American immigrants. The present study explored the relationship between acculturative stress, depression, and suicidal ideation among Central American immigrants. Also examined were variables that predict depression and suicidal ideation. Elevated levels of acculturative stress were significantly correlated with high levels of depression and suicidal ideation. Family dysfunction, ineffective social support, nonpositive expectations concerning the future, low levels of religiosity, low levels of education and income, and lack of agreement with the decision to immigrate mere significantly associated with high levels of depression and suicidal ideation. The overall findings suggest that Central American immigrants who experience elevated levels of acculturative stress may be at risk for experiencing heightened levels of depression and suicidal ideation. The findings highlight the importance of using culturally relevant clinical methods when assessing and treating depressed and potentially suicidal acculturating individuals.

AB Craniomaxillofacial gunshot injuries, resulting from assault, suicide attempts, and accidental trauma, represent a major public health dilemma in the United States. Due to the extent of injury and resulting osseous and soft tissue loss, facial gunshot wounds pose a unique challenge to the reconstructive surgeon. Initial management should use advanced trauma life support principles with the goal of patient stabilization. Acute operative management should center around wound decontamination, debridement, and temporary closure. Historically, definitive surgical management focused on delayed reconstruction secondary to high rates of wound infections, necrosis, and ischemia. With improvements in imaging modalities, the advent of virtual surgical planning, and the popularization of microvascular free flaps, contemporary methods have shifted toward earlier more definitive reconstruction. Autologous free tissue transfer has resulted in a decrease in hospital stay and the number of overall surgeries. Importantly, due to the variability in injury pattern and complexity in reconstruction, a systematic approach toward intervention is needed to mitigate complications and optimize overall functional and aesthetic outcomes.

AB This article reviews the prevalence of bipolar disorder, as well as the studies quantifying the burden of illness and cost of illness of this condition. It also discusses barriers to treatment. Multiple epi demiologic studies suggest a lifetime prevalence of bipolar I disorder of nearly 1%, making it a common illness. Bipolar illness is not only common, but for those affected, it is a significant source of distress, disability, loss of life through suicide, and burden on relatives and other caregivers. In 1990, the World Health Organization identified bipolar disorder as the sixth leading cause of disability-adjusted life years in the world among people aged 15 to 44 years. Costs to society appear to be roughly 70% of those for schizophrenia. Despite the burden imposed by bipolar illness and the availability of several effective treatments for the illness, many bipolar patients in the United States continue to face significant barriers to care.

AB The purpose of the study was to examine the impact of employment status on homicide victimization among cohort members. Data were derived from the US National Longitudinal Mortality Study. Cox proportional hazards regression models were fitted to the data. Analysis showed that employment status was significantly associated with homicide. The unemployed were over 50% more likely to become homicide victims than the employed. Persons not in the labor force were 1.3 times more likely to be victimized than employed cohort members. Results also showed that race was significantly associated with homicide. Non-Hispanic Blacks were over 4.5 times as likely to die as whites. Hispanics were nearly 1.9 times as likely to be victims as Non-Hispanic whites. When the sample was stratified by race/ethnicity, unemployment was highly significant for both non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic African American men. Employment status is a significant risk factor for homicide victimization.

AB Since 2002, hundreds of thousands of United States troops have returned from the Iraq and Afghanistan theaters, many after multiple deployments. The high suicide rate and high prevalence of mood disorders, substance use disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in this population have been widely reported. Many returning soldiers have had difficulty adjusting to civilian life, and some have incurred legal charges. In this article, I review the prevalence and legal implications of combat-related PTSD in this population, including how symptoms of PTSD may be relevant in criminal responsibility determinations in jurisdictions that use a M'Naughten standard or American Law Institute (ALI) Model Penal Code test for criminal responsibility. Finally, an actual case in which a criminal defendant was found to lack criminal responsibility in a M'Naughten jurisdiction because of PTSD symptoms at the time of the alleged offense will be presented.

AB Social anxiety disorder (SAD) and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) are two separate, but conceptually overlapping nosological entities. In this review, we examine similarities between SAD and BDD in comorbidity, phenomenology, cognitive biases, treatment outcome, and cross-cultural aspects. Our review suggests that SAD and BDD are highly comorbid, show a similar age of onset, share a chronic trajectory, and show similar cognitive biases for interpreting ambiguous social information in a negative manner. Furthermore, research from treatment outcome studies have demonstrated that improvements in SAD were significantly correlated with improvements in BDD. Findings from cross-cultural research suggest that BDD may be conceived as a subtype of SAD in some Eastern cultures. Directions for future research and clinical implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: This study examined trends in hospitalizations of youths for behavioral health conditions in acute care hospital nonpsychiatric beds, acute care hospital psychiatric and detoxification beds, and specialty psychiatric hospitals.
   Methods: Using data on hospitalizations for behavioral health conditions in 2009 (N=21,805) and 2014 (N=27,550) from the MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database, this study examined the percentage of youths (ages two to 18) with one or more hospitalizations, by demographic characteristic and bed type, and the behavioral health diagnoses for which patients were hospitalized.
   Results: The greatest increase in hospitalizations of youths occurred in acute care hospital psychiatric and detoxification beds. The percentage of hospitalizations for suicidal ideation or self-harm injuries increased by 17.8 (N=526) to 30.0 (N=1,249) percentage points, depending on bed type.
   Conclusions: The continued trend of rising hospitalizations of youths is consistent with recent studies showing a doubling of hospitalizations of youths for suicide and self-harm.

AB Withdrawn/depressed behavior (WD) as defined by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) relates to various outcomes in developmental psychopathology such as depression, pervasive developmental disorders, and suicide. We sought to examine the temperamental characteristics of children who concurrently endorse symptoms of WD. Junior Temperament and Characteristic Inventory (JTCI) and CBCL data were collected from 397 children's parents in a family study in the northeastern United States. Linear mixed models were used to test the relations between WD and temperament dimensions (Novelty Seeking, Harm Avoidance, Reward Dependence, Persistence) on the JTCI, while controlling for age, sex, item overlap, and co-occurring aggression and attention problems. When controlling for definitional artifact and CBCL aggressive behavior and attention scores, high harm avoidance and low reward dependence were both significant predictors of childhood withdrawn behavior. This study marks the first characterization of a temperamental profile associated with WD in children and adolescents.

AB Objectives: To examine all-cause and cause-specific mortality over a 15-year follow-up period in relation to at-baseline reported lifetime use of illegal drugs from five classes (marijuana, cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, and inhalants) among adults in the United States (US) household population. Methods: The study involved 20,983 sample adults who responded to the 1991 National Health Interview Survey Drug and Alcohol Use supplemental questionnaire and also met the eligibility criteria for mortality follow-up. Cox proportional hazards models were estimated to examine the relationships. Results: Adults who at baseline reported lifetime heroin use were at significantly higher risk of all-cause death over the follow-up period (hazard rate ratio or HR = 2.02; 95% confidence interval or CI 1.26-3.23), compared with those who did not report using drugs from any of the five classes, even after adjusting for age, sex, race, education, marital status, cigarette smoking status, and alcohol use status. Those who at baseline reported lifetime cocaine (no heroin) use had a significantly higher rate of death associated with human immunodeficiency virus diseases over the follow-up period than nonusers of drugs from any of the five classes. Several limitations of the analysis are discussed. Conclusions: Further research is needed to understand and track the elevated mortality associated with illegal drug use and the correlates of drug-poisoning deaths.

TI Life and Death in Rikers Island.
SO HASTINGS CENTER REPORT
LA English
DT Book Review
AB More than just a jail, Rikers has become a site of shifting discourse on punishment and justice in the United States. In the book Life and Death in Rikers Island, Homer Venters argues that the systematic failures of jails to provide appropriate safety and care constitute human rights violations and public health risks. The former chief medical officer and commissioner of correctional health services for the NYC Health and Hospitals system, Venters offers critical insight on the Rikers jail system. "Because jails are chaotic and concealed from outside view," he asserts, "we only become aware of them when very bad outcomes occur, such as deaths." Life and Death's success lies in how it blends Venters's experiences on the ground as a health care professional with the empirical data he's been able to collect and analyze over the tenure of his career. According to Venters, all suicides, homicides, and accidental deaths in jail are jail attributable, as they reflect system-wide failures in safety.

AB Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide; its incidence is increasing in the United States. Depending on disease extent and underlying liver status, patients may be treated with local, locoregional, and/or systemic therapy. Recent data indicates that radiotherapy (RT) can play a meaningful role in the management of HCC. Here, we review published experiences using RT for HCC, including the use of radiosensitizers and stereotactic RT. We discuss methods for performing preclinical studies of RT for HCC and biomarkers of response. As a part of the HCC Working Group, an informal committee of the National Cancer Institute's Radiation Research Program, we suggest how RT should be implemented in the management of HCC and identify future directions for the study of RT in HCC.

DE MindMatters; teacher; school administrator; prevention
ID SERVICES; YOUTH
AB Assessed the feasibility of the Australian MindMatters program, a whole school mental health promotion program for application in the United States (U.S.). Forty-two participants representing school and community stakeholder groups from four U.S. communities (urban, rural, suburban, small town) evaluated the program for application in their communities through a research process involving discussion and endorsement ratings of relevance and likely impact. The majority of participants (85%) indicated that the program would help students in their community schools feel safe and valued, and participants indicated strong endorsement for MindMatters curriculum units focusing on suicide prevention and addressing bullying and harassment. Participants rated their own stakeholder group (e.g., teacher, school administrator, and parent) as being most likely to support and implement the program, suggesting that providing qualitative feedback on a program may help to increase a sense of ownership over it. Ideas for tailoring programs developed in other settings for application in local communities are discussed.

   RELIGION; SUICIDE
AB Numerous studies have investigated the Southern culture of violence (SCOV). In particular, prior analyses have focused on white argument-based homicide in rural areas, a context in which the SCOV should be most prominent. Initial analyses examined dichotomous regional indicators (South/non-South) and often neglected to control for structural disadvantage. Recent research developed a summary based measure of Southern cultural influence that consolidates regional, ethnic, and religious characteristics. Unfortunately, a lack of available data on the underlying circumstances of different forms of violence has hindered our ability to assess the generality of the Southern cultural tolerance of violence. The current study addresses this limitation by using NIBRS data to assess the influence of a composite measure of Southern culture on variation in white argument-based aggravated assault. Analyses of county-level data support the generalizability of the Southern cultural influence to non-lethal forms of argument-based violence.

AB Criminal death incidence of women varies between developed and developing countries, and it has become a common public problem in almost every country. We do not have any data about femicide cases published in Turkey until today. In our study, we tried to call attention to femicide cases. In our study, we evaluated 141 cases of female homicides with an interval of 10 years between January 1996 and May 2005, retrospectively. Data retrieved were statistically evaluated using chi-square test. Most of the cases were between 21 and 35 years of age. Spouse murders are usually witnessed during the process of divorce. Establishment of institutions which will ensure the security of women during this period is of paramount importance. If we protect women during divorce and separation proceedings, we can prevent femicide cases. We also think that laws may be strengthened for protecting women who are vulnerable at such times.

DE Terminator seeds; food security; ethical issues; biodiversity
AB Biodiversity and food security especially in developing countries are under threat by a newly patented technique for preventing plants from producing viable seeds. The method dubbed "the suicide seeds" by critics was developed in a joint venture between the United State Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Mississippi based Delta and Pine Land Company, the largest cotton seed company in the world. Ethically, the technology will enslave farmers by making them dependent on multi-national seed companies for supply of seed inputs and other chemical inducers. The advocates of the new technology argue that for patents to be protected effectively, the technique has to be incorporated into seeds. However, multi-national seed companies, like Monsanto, control the supply of these seeds and farmers in developing countries will be hooked to these seeds. Critics argue that the technology endangers biodiversity and well-being of 1.4 billion rural people world wide, especially, in developing countries that normally depend on farm-saved seed.

AB We compared the prevalence and correlates of adolescent suicidal ideation and attempts in two nationally representative probability samples of adolescents interviewed in 1995 (National Survey of Adolescents; N = 4,023) and 2005 (National Survey of Adolescents-Replication; N = 3,614). Participants in both samples completed a telephone survey that assessed major depressive episode (MDE), post-traumatic stress disorder, suicidal ideation and attempts, violence exposure, and substance use. Results demonstrated that the lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation among adolescents was lower in 2005 than 1995, whereas the prevalence of suicide attempts remained stable. MDE was the strongest predictor of suicidality in both samples. In addition, several demographic, substance use, and violence exposure variables were significantly associated with increased risk of suicidal ideation and attempts in both samples, with female gender, nonexperimental drug use, and direct violence exposure being consistent risk factors in both samples.

Together with biographical details, the role played by the Institute of Research in Karlsruhe and the establishment of the Rotameter site in Aachen is presented. The historical outline finishes with a short report of the author's first experience with Rotameters at the Nuffeld Department of Anaesthestics, Oxford University during the Second World War and with his subsequent efforts to introduce Rotameters into anesthesia equipment design in the United States.

AB This study examined the extent to which violent behavior and peer victimization were associated with suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts in a nationally representative sample of 11,113 adolescents who completed the 2005 Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Boys were more likely to be involved in physical fighting and weapon carrying, whereas girls were more likely to report suicidal behavior and feeling unsafe at school. Predictors of suicidal behavior for both male and female adolescents included carrying a weapon, being threatened or injured at school, having property stolen or damaged at school, and getting in a fight. Carrying a weapon and getting in fights in the community, but not in the school, were significantly associated with suicidal behavior for girls. Feeling unsafe in school was predictive of suicidal behavior for girls, but not for boys. Implications for practice, including the importance of coordinating violence and suicide prevention efforts, are discussed.

SO SOUTHERN MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID SUICIDE; WASHINGTON
AB Background: Although many studies of euthanasia and physician-assisted death (PAD) have been performed in the United States, none have specifically addressed attitudes among physicians practicing in Tennessee.
   Methods: In January 2001, we mailed a 30-item survey instrument to a stratified random sample of 1,117 physicians drawn from the Tennessee Licensing Bureau.
   Results: Tennessee physicians are highly polarized over the issues of euthanasia and assisted death. A slight majority (47%) did not favor euthanasia or PAD and would oppose the legalization of such procedures. Of the physicians supporting euthanasia or PAD (43%), only 25% would administer a lethal overdose and less than a third would counsel/prescribe medication for an overdose. Attitudes were influenced by three primary factors: ethics, religion, and the role of the physician to relieve pain and suffering.
   Conclusion: Regardless of their overall position, the majority of physicians agreed on basic restrictions and safeguards to prevent abuses and to protect vulnerable patients.

AB Violations occur when pilots deliberately break safety rules; they are a serious and vexing problem in aviation. Study one engaged cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling and Pathfinder network analysis on an experimentally derived similarity matrix of violation causes to discover the structure of violation reasoning. Using the insights so gained, a classification was constructed based on actor intent with four categories:
   Improvement. The intention is to increase safety or production, a desire to do better.
   Malevolent. The intention is to cause harm or reduce production, a desire to do damage.
   Indolent. The intention is to increase operator ease, a desire for lethargy.
   Hedonic. The intention is to increase operator excitement, a desire for sensation.
   Study two tested the taxonomy for reliability by having aviation experts assign categories to six accident reports. The taxonomy was found to have a free-marginal multirater kappa of 0.82, which is considered excellent. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: This study examines the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations among cognitive variables, depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation in Hong Kong Chinese and Caucasian American adolescents. Methods: Community adolescents (n = 2,044) ages 14-18 years from Hong Kong and the United States provided information regarding their suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, and cognitions (self-efficacy, cognitive errors and hopelessness), at two surveys, six months apart. Results: Self-efficacy was a weak unique predictor of suicidal ideation in both cultures. Hopelessness was the strongest of cognitive variables in concurrent associations with suicidal ideation in bivariate and multivariate models, in both cultures, and in both boys and girls. Hopelessness continued to offer unique prediction when depressive symptoms were controlled, both concurrently and prospectively. Conclusions: Our results support hopelessness theories of suicidal ideation and behavior in Hong Kong, and extend the cognitive theory of suicidality to a modernized Asian culture.

DE history of dermatology; Jewish dermatologists; emigration
ID NAZI REGIME
AB In the context of our investigation, we found information on 432 (76%) of the 569 Jewish dermatologists in Germany. There is evidence that 57 (10%) of the Jewish dermatologists were murdered in concentration camps, 61 (10.7%) died a natural death, 13 (2%) committed suicide, and 25 (4%) survived the Third Reich in Germany. After 1933, 276 (49%) Jewish dermatologists were able to leave Germany; the United States of America was the main destination and 107 (or 41%) emigrated there. A total of 34 (13%) Jewish dermatologists emigrated from Germany to Palestine and 16 to Latin America. Regarding emigration to other European countries, 20 of the Jewish dermatologists from Germany went to Great Britain (including Walter Freudenthal, 1893-1952, and Ernst Sklarz, 1894-1975), and 24 emigrated to other European countries, such as France (Rudolf Mayer, 1895-1962), Sweden (Carl Lennhoff, 1883-1963), and the Netherlands (Otto Schlein, 1895-1944).

AB Background: Injury mortality data for adults in the United States and other countries consistently show higher mortality for those with lower socioeconomic status (SES). Data are sparse regarding the role of SES among adult, non-fatal US injuries. The current study estimated non-fatal injury risk by household income using hospital emergency department (ED) visits.
   Methods: A total of 1,308,892 ED visits at 10 Atlanta (Georgia USA) hospitals from 2001-2004 (347,866 injuries) were studied. The SES was based on US census-block group income, with subjects assigned to census blocks based on reported residence. Logistic regression was used to determine risk by SES for injuries versus all other ED visits, adjusting for demographics, hospital, and weather. Supplemental analyses using hospital data from 2010-2013, without data on SES, were conducted to determine whether earlier patterns by race, age, and gender persisted.
   Results: Risk for many injury categories increased with higher income. Odds ratio by quartiles of increasing income (lowest quartile as referent, 95% confidence interval [CI] given for upper most quartile) were 1.00, 1.23, 1.34, 1.40 (95% CI 1.36-1.45) for motor vehicle accidents; 1.00, 1.03, 1.11, 1.24 (95% CI 1.20-1.29) for being struck by objects; 1.00. 0.99, 1.04, 1.12 (95% CI 1.00-1.25) for suicide; and 1.00, 1.03, 1.05, 1.12 (95% CI 1.09-1.15) for falls. In contrast, decreased injury risk with increased household income was seen for assaults (1.00, 0.83, 0.73, 0.67 [95% CI 0.63-0.72], by increasing quartiles). These trends by income did not differ markedly by race and gender. Whites generally had less risk of injuries, with the exception of assaults and motor vehicle accidents. Males had higher risk of injury than females, with the exception of falls and suicide attempts. Patterns of risk for race, age, and gender were consistent between 2001-2004 and 2010-2013.
   Conclusion: For most non-fatal injuries, those with higher income had more risk of ED visits, although the opposite was true for assault.

AB The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview-Plus (MINI-Plus) was used to assess the frequency of mental and addictive disorders among 320 randomly selected men and women newly committed to the general population of the Iowa prison system. More than 90 percent of offenders met criteria for a current or lifetime psychiatric disorder. The most frequent were substance use disorders (90%), mood disorders (54%), psychotic disorders (35%), antisocial personality disorder (35%), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (22%). Offenders had a mean of 4.2 MINI-Plus disorders, and two-thirds had 3 or more disorders. Contrary to expectation, there were few gender-based differences. Thirty percent of the offenders were rated at risk for suicide. We conclude that mental and addictive disorders are common among incarcerated offenders and that these individuals are at risk for suicidal behavior.

TI Youth risk behavior surveillance - United States, 1999
SO JOURNAL OF SCHOOL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB Priority health-risk behaviors, which contribute to the leading causes of mortality and morbidity among youth and adults, often are established during youth, extend into adulthood, are interrelated, and are preventable. The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors six categories of priority health-risk behaviors among youth and young adults - behaviors that contribute to unintentional and intentional injuries; tobacco use; alcohol and other drug use; sexual behaviors that contribute to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) (including human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection); unhealthy dietary behaviors; and physical inactivity. The YRBSS includes a national school-based survey conducted by CDC as well as state, territorial, and local school-based surveys conducted by education and health agencies. This report summarizes results from the national survey, 33 state surveys, and 16 local surveys conducted among high school students during February through May 1999.
   In the United States, approximately three fourths of all deaths among persons aged 10-24 years result from only four causes: motor vehicle crashes, other unintentional injuries homicide, and suicide. Results from the 1999 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey demonstrate that numerous high school students engage in behaviors that increase their likelihood of death from these four causes 16.4% had rarely or never worn a seat belt; during the 30 days preceding the survey, 33.1% had ridden with a driver who had been drinking alcohol; 17.3% had carried a weapon during the 30 days preceding the survey; 50.0% had drunk alcohol during the 30 days preceding the survey; 26.7% had used marijuana during the 30 days preceding the survey; and 7.8% had attempted suicide during the 12 months preceding the survey. Substantial morbidity and social problems among young persons also result from unintended pregnancies and STDs, including HN infection. In 1999, nationwide, 49.9% of high school students had ever had sexual intercourse, 42.0% of sexually active students had not used a condom at last sexual intercourse; and 1.8% had ever injected an illegal drug. Two thirds of all deaths among persons aged greater than or equal to 25 years result from only two causes - cardiovascular disease and cancer The majority of risk behaviors associated with these two causes of death are initiated during adolescence. In 1999, 34.8% of high school students had smoked cigarettes during the 30 days preceding the survey; 76.1% had not eaten greater than or equal to 5 servings/day of fruits and vegetables during the 7 days preceding the survey; 16.0% were at risk for becoming overweight,- and 70.9% did not attend physical education class daily.
   These YRBSS data are already being used by health and education officials at national, state, and local levels to analyze and improve policies and programs to reduce priority health-risk behaviors among youth. The YRBSS data also are being used to measure progress toward achieving 16 national health objectives for 2010 and 3 of the 10 leading health indicators.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of comorbid alcohol and drug use disorders on premature death, as reflected by the manner of death (suicide and other unnatural death versus natural death) and the age at death, among decedents with unipolar and bipolar disorders.
   Methods: This study is based on the US Multiple Cause of Death public-use data files for 1999 to 2006. Secondary data analysis was conducted comparing decedents with unipolar/bipolar disorders and decedents with all other causes of death, based on the death records of 19 052 468 decedents in the Multiple Cause of Death data files who died at 15 years and older. Poisson regression models were used to derive prevalence ratios to assess the effect of comorbid substance use disorders (SUD) on the risks for being an unnatural death among mood disorder deaths. Multiple-cause life table analysis and mean age at death were used to quantify the effect of comorbid SUDs on premature mortality among mood disorder deaths.
   Results: Prevalence of comorbid SUDs was higher among unipolar and bipolar disorder deaths than that among all other deaths. Among unipolar and bipolar disorder deaths, comorbid SUDs were associated with elevated risks for suicide and other unnatural death in both men and women (prevalence ratios ranging 1.49-9.46, P < .05). They also were associated with reductions in mean ages at death (ranging 11.7-33.8 years, P < .05). In general, these effects were much stronger for drug use disorders than for alcohol use disorders. Both SUDs had stronger effects on suicide among women, whereas their effects on other unnatural deaths were stronger among men.
   Conclusions: This study is among the first to provide population mortality-based evidence to further establish comorbid SUD as one of the key risk factors for premature death among individuals with unipolar or bipolar disorders in the United States. Clinicians need to be aware of the potentially lethal risk associated with these comorbid conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI A Brief Measure of Unbearable Psychache
SO SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective Psychache has been proposed to cause suicide when it becomes unbearable. However, existing measures of psychache do not directly target unbearable psychache. Thus, the purpose of the current study was to provide initial validation for a brief measure of unbearable psychache.
   Method Three items were selected to create the Unbearable Psychache Scale (UP3). Psychometric properties were assessed in two populations: (1) an online sample composed of 1,006 adults (53% male) from various locations in the United States and (2) a sample of 190 psychiatric inpatient adults (47% male) from a hospital in Western Canada.
   Results In both samples, the UP3 demonstrated excellent internal reliability, and strong convergent and predictive validity. Additionally, the UP3 predicted significant variance in suicidal ideation over and above documented correlates of suicidal ideation including general psychache, hopelessness, perceived burdensomeness, and low belongingness.
   Conclusions The UP3 is a brief, psychometrically sound measure of unbearable psychache that may be well-suited for use in research protocols and clinical assessments.

AB Latina adolescents are one of the fastest growing demographic groups in the United States and have been found to experience higher levels of emotional distress than their non-Latino counterparts. Reliance on emotional support from the teens' social network is a common coping mechanism. While digital media is increasingly used by Latinas to communicate and express themselves, few, if any, studies have explored the perspectives of Latinas on the role of technology in helping the enactment of emotional support. In this paper, we share the perspectives of thirteen Latina adolescents (15-18 years old) that emerged through a series of participation design workshops. Our findings suggest that bicultural aspects of Latina identity can influence perspectives on the role of technology, and provide insights into attitudes towards bicultural conflicts in emotional health. We also share our participatory design technique that incorporated an ecological framework and suggestions for future use of such an approach.

   MANAGEMENT
AB On November 6, 2001 U.S. Attorney General Ashcroft reinterpreted the Controlled Substances Act in a manner consistent with the Pain Relief Promotion Act, a bill introduced in the last Congress. This reinterpretation criminalizes actions related to the provision of controlled substances (e.g. opioids, barbiturates) in the event that a patient dies and external observers believe the intent of providing the medication was to hasten the patient's death. This paper analyzes the arguments regarding the need for reinterpretation and the potential consequences of such an action on pain relief. The conclusion is that the weight of the data clearly leads to the prediction that this reinterpretation of the Controlled Substances Act will lead physicians to be less likely to provide adequate types and doses of pain medication to patients who may die.

AB I use data from the General Social Survey to evaluate several hypotheses regarding how beliefs in and about God predict attitudes toward voluntary euthanasia. I find that certainty in the belief in God significantly predicts negative attitudes toward voluntary euthanasia. I also find that belief in a caring God and in a God that is the primary source of moral rules significantly predicts negative attitudes toward voluntary euthanasia. I also find that respondents' beliefs about the how close they are to God and how close they want to be with God predict negative attitudes toward voluntary euthanasia. These associations hold even after controlling for religious affiliation, religious attendance, views of the Bible, and sociodemographic factors. The findings indicate that to understand individuals' attitudes about voluntary euthanasia, one must pay attention to their beliefs in and about God.

AB The paper outlines the policy context and summarizes the numerous policy issues that AD raises from the more generic to the unique. It posits that strong public fears of AD and its future prevalence projections and costs, raise increasingly difficult policy dilemmas. After reviewing the costs in human lives and money and discussing the latest U.S. policy initiatives, the paper presents two policy areas as examples the demanding policy decisions we face. The first focuses on the basic regulatory function of protecting the public from those who would exploit these fears. The second centers on the well-debated issues of advance directives and euthanasia that surround AD. Although more dialogue, education and research funding are needed to best serve the interests of AD patients and families as well as society at large, this will be challenging because of the strong feelings and divisions AD engenders.

AB Aim: Among adolescents, poisoning is a leading cause of injury mortality in the United States. This study describes the epidemiology of poisonings, intoxication, and maladaptive effects of drugs among adolescents age 10-19 years in a large city.
   Methods: An injury surveillance system used records at seven hospitals, medical examiner records, and vital records over a two year period.
   Results: Of 633 cases (618 injuries/100 000/year), 6% were unintentional, 36% self-inflicted, 41% alcohol intoxication, and 15% maladaptive effects of drugs. Alcohol was involved in 45% of cases, 23% illegal drugs, 23% nonprescription drugs, 19% prescription drugs; 19% involved more than one substance. Hospitalization was required in 20%; 8% transferred to another hospital; one died from intoxication. The authors found high rates of self-inflicted poisoning, intoxication, and maladaptive effects of drugs among this urban population.
   Conclusion: The study highlights the need to broadly define poisonings among adolescents and the challenge of assessing intent in some cases.

AB The present study related generational status, marital status, parental overprotection (control), and cultural value conflict to self-esteem and depression among first and second-generation Asian Indian immigrant women in the south-midwestern United States. Self-report data from 73 community-dwelling women supported the hypotheses that unmarried and second-generation women would report greater maternal control and cultural value conflict than would married and first-generation women. Second-generational status, high maternal control, and high cultural value conflict correlated with higher depressive symptomology; being married, low maternal control, and low cultural value conflict were related to high self-esteem. Regression analyses indicated a mediating role for cultural value conflict for depression symptom predictors, but not for self-esteem predictors. Open-ended response data provided enriched understanding of these women's cultural and family conflicts.

AB In this article I examine the performances of black girlhood in two texts by Ntozake Shange-the choreopoem "for colored girls who have considered suicide when the rainbow is enuf "(1977) and the novel Sassafras, Cypress and Indigo (1982). The black girls whom Shange portrays navigate anti-black racism in their communities, domestic violence in their homes, and explore their connections with spirit worlds. In both these works, Shange stages black girls who make decisions based on their understanding of the spheres of influence that their race, gender, and age afford them in an anti-black patriarchal world dominated by adults. I draw, too, from Patricia Hill Collins's work on feminist standpoint theory and black feminist thought to introduce the term black girl thought as a theoretical framework to offer insights into the complex lives of black girls who live in the post-civil rights era in the United States.

AB As a result of the AIDS epidemic, there has been considerable expansion in research targeted at inner-city drug-using populations. Anthropology has played an important role in the effort to better understand HIV risk behaviors among drug users and to develop empirically grounded interventions. However, the study of highly vulnerable and social stigmatized populations raises important ethical issues, including the full extent of researcher responsibility to the subjects of research. This paper uses a case study approach to explore these issues. The case in question is a research participant who was killed by police in what they describe as a "police-assisted suicide" not long after his last interaction with research staff. The paper seeks to initiate discussion among researchers, funders, providers, and policy makers concerning key ethical and responsibility issues in HIV/AIDS research.

AB IMPORTANCE Understanding global variation in firearm mortality rates could guide prevention policies and interventions.
   OBJECTIVE To estimate mortality due to firearm injury deaths from 1990 to 2016 in 195 countries and territories.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study used deidentified aggregated data including 13 812 location-years of vital registration data to generate estimates of levels and rates of death by age-sex-year-location. The proportion of suicides in which a firearm was the lethal means was combined with an estimate of per capita gun ownership in a revised proxy measure used to evaluate the relationship between availability or access to firearms and firearm injury deaths.
   EXPOSURES Firearm ownership and access.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cause-specific deaths by age, sex, location, and year.
   RESULTS Worldwide, it was estimated that 251 000 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 195 000-276 000) people died from firearm injuries in 2016, with 6 countries (Brazil, United States, Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, and Guatemala) accounting for 50.5%(95% UI, 42.2%-54.8%) of those deaths. In 1990, there were an estimated 209 000 (95% UI, 172 000 to 235 000) deaths from firearm injuries. Globally, the majority of firearm injury deaths in 2016 were homicides (64.0%[95% UI, 54.2%-68.0%]; absolute value, 161 000 deaths [95% UI, 107 000-182 000]); additionally, 27% were firearm suicide deaths (67 500 [95% UI, 55 400-84 100]) and 9% were unintentional firearm deaths (23 000 [95% UI, 18 200-24 800]). From 1990 to 2016, there was no significant decrease in the estimated global age-standardized firearm homicide rate (-0.2%[95% UI, -0.8% to 0.2%]). Firearm suicide rates decreased globally at an annualized rate of 1.6%(95% UI, 1.1-2.0), but in 124 of 195 countries and territories included in this study, these levels were either constant or significant increases were estimated. There was an annualized decrease of 0.9% (95% UI, 0.5%-1.3%) in the global rate of age-standardized firearm deaths from 1990 to 2016. Aggregate firearm injury deaths in 2016 were highest among persons aged 20 to 24 years (for men, an estimated 34 700 deaths [95% UI, 24 900-39 700] and for women, an estimated 3580 deaths [95% UI, 2810-4210]). Estimates of the number of firearms by country were associated with higher rates of firearm suicide (P<.001; R-2 = 0.21) and homicide (P<.001; R-2 = 0.35).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study estimated between 195 000 and 276 000 firearm injury deaths globally in 2016, the majority of which were firearm homicides. Despite an overall decrease in rates of firearm injury death since 1990, there was variation among countries and across demographic subgroups.

AB Despite overall improvements in life expectancy, rates of premature male mortality, particularly for men in areas of socioeconomic deprivation, remain an important issue of concern in the United Kingdom. Interventions to engage men and promote their health and wellbeing have developed, albeit sporadically, over recent decades in response to this health inequity. This paper provides a 10-year update on the state of men's health promotion in the United Kingdom. It begins by highlighting changes in male life expectancy and possible explanations for these shifts, including a relative failure to address mental health promotion and male suicide, before providing detail about how practice approaches to men's health promotion have evolved over the period 2005-2016. Such changes are not removed from the wider socioeconomic context. This paper therefore, then, considers movements in the policy context and possible influences of this before exploring the challenges that remain for men's health promotion. We suggest that despite certain improvements in the practice of men's health promotion and in men's health outcomes, issues remain in terms of premature mortality, particularly for certain groups of men. We further suggest that many of the difficulties in improving and promoting the health of men further lie with a market-driven neoliberal policy context that engenders inequality through the inequitable distribution of and access to material resources and through individualistic approaches to health promotion that serve men from economically and socially disadvantaged locations least well.

TI Association of Exposure to Police Violence With Prevalence of Mental

SO JAMA NETWORK OPEN

AB IMPORTANCE Police violence is reportedly widespread in the United States and may pose a significant risk to public mental health.
   OBJECTIVE To examine the association between 12-month exposure to police violence and concurrent mental health symptoms independent of trauma history, crime involvement, and other forms of interpersonal violence exposure.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional, general population survey study of 1221 eligible adults was conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, and New York City, New York, from October through December 2017. Participants were identified through Qualtrics panels, an internetbased survey administration service using quota sampling.
   EXPOSURES Past 12-month exposure to police violence, assessed using the Police Practices Inventory. Subtypes of violence exposure were coded according to the World Health Organization domains of violence (ie, physical, sexual, psychological, and neglectful).
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Current Kessler ScreeningScale for Psychological Distress (K6) score, past 12-month psychotic experiences (World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview), and past 12-month suicidal ideation and attempts.
   RESULTS Of 1221 eligible participants, there were 1000 respondents (81.9% participation rate). The sample matched the adult population of included cities on race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, 339 [33.9%]; non-Hispanic black/African American, 390 [39.0%]; Hispanic/Latino, 178 [17.8%]; other, 93 [9.3%]), age (mean [SD]. 39.8 [15.2] years), and gender (women, 600 [60.0%]; men. 394 [39.4%]; transgender, 6 [0.6%]) within 10% above or beyond 2010 census distributions. Twelve-month prevalence of police violence was 3.2% for sexual violence, 7.5% for physical violence without a weapon, 4.6% for physical violence with a weapon, 13.2% for psychological violence, and 14.9% for neglect. Police violence exposures were higher among men, people of color, and those identified as homosexual or transgender. Respondents reported suicidal ideation (9.1%), suicide attempts (3.1%), and psychotic experiences (20.6%). The mean (SD) K6 score was 5.8 (6.1). All mental health outcomes were associated with police violence exposure in adjusted logistic regression analyses. Physical violence with a weapon and sexual violence were associated with greater odds of psychotic experiences (odds ratio [95% CI]: 4.34 [2.05-9.18] for physical violence with a weapon; 6.61 [2.5217.36] for sexual violence), suicide attempts (odds ratio [95% CI]: 7.30 [2.94-18.14] for physical violence with a weapon; 6.63 [2.64-16.64] for sexual violence), and suicidal ideation (odds ratio [95% CI]: 2.72 [1.30-5.68] for physical violence with a weapon; 3.76 [1.72-8.20] for sexual violence).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Police violence was commonly reported, especially among racial/ethnic and sexual minorities. Associations between violence and mental health outcomes did not appear to be explained by confounding factors and appeared to be especially pronounced for assaultive forms of violence.

AB End-of-life care of critically ill patients generally consists of two closely related practices: the withholding and withdrawal of life support, and the administration of palliative care. In the United States, the withholding or withdrawal of life support is legally justified by the principles of informed consent and informed refusal. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that competent patients may refuse any and all treatments, including those that sustain life. All states sanction such refusal by competent patients, and most states allow surrogates to refuse treatment on behalf of incompetent patients. Although some physicians use the concept of futility to unilaterally withhold or withdraw life support, the Supreme Court has not heard a futility case, and the only clear legal rule on futile treatment is the traditional malpractice test, which measures physician actions against standards of medical care. However, the Supreme Court has furnished guidelines on the administration of palliative care. By using the principle of double effect, these guidelines allow physicians to give sedative and analgesic agents to dying patients if they intend to relive pain and suffering but not to hasten death.

AB Objective This study investigated whether the Child Safety Collaborative Innovation and Improvement Network (CS CoIIN) framework could be applied in the field of injury and violence prevention to reduce fatalities, hospitalizations and emergency department visits among 0-19year olds.
   Sample Twenty-one states/jurisdictions were accepted into cohort 1 of the CS CoIIN, and 14 were engaged from March 2016 through April 2017. A quality improvement framework was used to test, implement and spread evidence-based change ideas (strategies and programs) in child passenger safety, falls prevention, interpersonal violence prevention, suicide and self-harm prevention and teen driver safety.
   Procedures Outcome and process measure data were analyzed using run chart rules. Descriptive data were analyzed for participation measures and descriptive statistics were produced. Qualitative data were analyzed to identify key themes.
   Results Seventy-six percent of CS CoIIN states/jurisdictions were engaged in activities and used data to inform decision making. Within a year, states/jurisdictions were able to test and implement evidence-based change ideas in pilot sites. A small group showed improvement in process measures and were ready to spread change ideas. Improvement in outcome measures was not achieved; however, 25% of states/jurisdictions identified data sources and reported on real-time outcome measures.
   Conclusions Evidence indicates the CS CoIIN framework can be applied to make progress on process measures, but more time is needed to determine if this will result in progress on long-term outcome measures of fatalities, hospitalizations and emergency department visits. Seventeen states/jurisdictions will participate in cohort 2.

AB BACKGROUND: Pediatric deaths and injuries from access to firearms are a significant public health problem. No studies have examined how experts determine child neglect regarding firearm access in the home. Our study objectives were to identify factors that influenced pediatric experts' finding of firearm-related child neglect and to assess their attitudes toward child access prevention (CAP) laws.
   METHODS: A survey was distributed to the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Child Abuse and Neglect members. Demographics, attitudes regarding CAP laws, and ages (up to 14 years old) at which experts deemed several scenarios as child neglect were determined. Scenarios tested potential versus actual loaded firearm access, presence or absence of a CAP law, and injury versus no injury when the firearm was accessed.
   RESULTS: One hundred ninety-three surveys were completed. Experts agreed (>95%) that CAP laws were important, even for children up to age 15 years. Although a high percentage considered potential access to a loaded firearm as child neglect, a CAP law significantly increased the percentage for each age. In addition, higher percentages of respondents from states with CAP laws than those without deemed potential access as child neglect for 12- and 14-year-olds. In contrast, if the child had accessed a loaded firearm, there were no significant differences in the high percentages that deemed the scenario as child neglect under any conditions, including with and without a CAP law.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although almost all child neglect experts considered potential and actual access to loaded firearms as child neglect, CAP laws increased the percentage for cases of potential access. Universal CAP laws may help ensure that determinations of child neglect are more consistent across states. The deterrent effect of potential child neglect findings may increase the number of parents securing firearms in ways that prevent child access and reduce firearm-related deaths and injuries.

AB Background: Poisoning in pregnancy can cause maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, but few data detail such events. Herein, we describe poisoning exposures in pregnant women identified by a large Canadian Poison Centre.Methods: This retrospective study evaluated poisoning exposures in pregnant women aged 12?60?years, reported to the Ontario Poison Centre from 2010 to 2017. Exposures were identified from the Poison Centre database by calls received, in which the patient was also reported to be pregnant. We collected patient demographics (age, trimester, and location), as well as information about the poisoning exposure (number and type of substances, route of exposure, reason for exposure, decontamination, and treatment recommendations).Results: There were 1716 cases of poisoning exposures during pregnancy over the eight-year study period, representing 0.28% of all 619,539 calls over the period. Median maternal age was 29?years (IQR 25?33), and exposures were most frequent in the second trimester of pregnancy (41%). Unintentional exposures (n?=?1397) accounted for 81% of all calls. Of the 18% of calls (n?=?305) for intentional exposures, 71% (n?=?219) were suspected attempted suicides. Intentional exposures were more frequent in the first (OR 2.64, 95% CI 1.85?3.76) and second trimesters (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.13?2.28), relative to third trimester. The associated risk of intentional exposures was more likely in women aged ?19?years (OR 21.41, 95% CI 12.75?35.94) and 20?29?years (OR 3.72, 95% CI 2.70?5.14), relative to women ?30?years old.Conclusions: Intentional poisoning exposures in pregnancy most commonly involve young women in the first two trimesters. Population-based studies are needed to further examine risk factors for overdose, poisoning, and self-harm in pregnancy, as well as perinatal outcomes.

TI Crime and socioeconomic situation.
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE

ID BUSINESS-CYCLE; UNITED-STATES; UNEMPLOYMENT; SUICIDE
AB Reflection on the relations between temporal evolution of criminality and the evolution of the socioeconomic situation is rather rough at the present time in France. In the United Kingdom. recent studies suggest that the economic cycle influences at the same time fluctuations in crimes on property, and fluctuations in crimes on people, In the USA, if before 1970 it is rarely said that there is a direct link between the criminality rate and unemployment, there is however a direct correlation which dominates in studies after 1970. The analysis of temporal evolution in unemployment, prices and salaries, in the male marriage rate and schooling put forward an interpretation of long-term delinquency and crime. The idea becomes apparent that the increase in opportunities, indicated by en evolution in consumption prices and in salaries, plays a more marked role during a period of sharp growth and has a stronger influence on predation than on violence, that the unemployment of unqualified young people is a factor which favours both delinquency for appropriation and violence. This phenomenon is masked partially in the periods where keeping young people in the school system was in full action, during the last decade of the 20th century, Finally. a reduction in the number of couples setting up. and more generally the tension in relations between sexes. could also have encouraged delinquency from the beginning of the 1980s.

TI The scientific agreement on firearm issues

DT Article
ID OF-THE-LITERATURE; SUICIDE; AVAILABILITY; HOMICIDE; LAWS
AB Introduction No one has systematically collected the views of firearm researchers to determine if and where agreement exists on the scientific evidence about firearms and firearm violence.
   Methods We send a short monthly on-line survey to firearm researchers. Each survey asks respondents their level of agreement with a statement about firearms, their rating of the quality of the scientific evidence on the specific issue, their familiarity with that literature and their area of expertise. Survey participants are first-authors of a firearms article published in a peer-reviewed journal since 2011. For the first 15 surveys, on average, surveys were sent to 322 researchers, and 109 researchers responded (34% response rate).
   Results Among respondents, approximately 46% were public health researchers and 32% were sociologists/ criminologists. Agreement exists among firearm researchers that more guns and weaker gun laws cause serious public health problems, that the costs of gun availability are typically greater than the benefits and that stronger gun laws may improve public safety and health. 84% of researchers agreed, and only 8% disagreed with the statement 'in the United States, having a gun in the home increases the risk of suicide'. For only three statements did most respondents rate the quality of the scientific evidence as strong or very strong. Overall, there was a higher level of agreement among public health/medicine researchers than among researchers in the other disciplines.
   Discussion Surveys of researchers can provide useful information about agreement on specific issues and about the quality of the scientific evidence.

   RISK-FACTORS; PREVALENCE; SAMPLE; FARMERS; ADULTS; BEHAVIORS
AB Purpose
   Older farmers experience a high rate of suicide, and depression is closely aligned with suicide among agricultural workers. Depressive symptoms may be influenced by work patterns, work satisfaction, stress, and health status. In addition, members of a couple may affect each other's depressive symptoms. The purpose was to determine whether depressive symptoms score is predicted by hours worked on the farm, satisfaction with work, number of health conditions, perceived stress, and demographics in a sample of older farm couples, and to assess the degree of influence on depressive symptoms spouses have on each other.
   Methods
   A total of 494 couples participated in the initial interview for a longitudinal study of farmers aged 50 and above. Data from husbands and wives were used together in a multilevel, dyad-based regression model to determine predictors of depressive symptoms.
   Findings
   Men's depressive symptoms scores were predicted by their own number of health conditions and stress and by their wives' stress and health conditions. Women's depressive symptoms scores were predicted by their own work satisfaction, stress, and number of health conditions and their husbands' time spent working on the farm and stress.
   Conclusions
   Stress management may be particularly important in older farm couples, since perceived duress of 1 member of the dyad impacts both. Work factors and health conditions also affect depressive symptoms in older rural couples, but these may be less easily modified.

AB Suicidal Ideation among Afghanistan/Iraq War Veterans remains a health concern. As young Veterans adjust to civilian life, new risk factors might emerge and manifest differently in this group versus those in the general population. We explored these differences. With 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data, we examined differences in risk of past-year suicidal ideation between Veterans of the Afghanistan/Iraq War periods aged 18-34 years (N=328) and age-comparable civilians (N=23,222). We compared groups based on individual and socio-environmental risk factors as well as perceptions of unmet mental healthcare needs. We report adjusted rate ratios (aRRs); interaction terms tested for between-group differences. PY suicidal ideation rates for Veterans and civilians did not differ (52 versus 59 per 1,000, p=0.60) and both groups shared many risk factors. However, drug problems and perceived unmet mental health care needs were vastly stronger risk factors among Veterans versus civilians (interaction terms indicated that the aRRs were 3.8-8.0 times higher for Veterans versus civilians). Other differences were discovered as well. Past-year suicidal ideation rates did not differ by Veteran status among young adults. However, different risk factors per group were detected, which can inform Veteran suicide prevention efforts. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

DT Editorial Material; Book Chapter
AB Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition triggered by seeing or experiencing an event that caused or threatened serious harm or death (National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), 2007. http://www.nimh.nih. gov/health/publications/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-research-fact-sheet/index. shtml; Mayo Clinic, 2011. http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/post-traumaticstress- disorder/DS00246). PTSD can be difficult to diagnose, but if left untreated, it can lead to a variety of serious personal, familial, and societal problems (e.g., domestic violence, suicide, unemployment). Current available therapeutic interventions for PTSD and major depression vary substantially in their effectiveness. Major impediments to the development of transformational interventions include a lack of basic disease-level knowledge, availability of biomarkers and translational tools, the clinical evidence to identify patients at-risk, and absence of personalized treatment approaches. The governments of the United States, United Kingdom and other countries have identified PTSD as a serious condition affecting many Service members returning from deployments. Many organizations have identified the need to develop new methods for detection and analysis of symptoms and for outreach to Service members suffering from psychological illnesses including PTSD. At present, a large percentage of Service members returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan suffer clinical levels of major depressive disorder and/or PTSD. This book presents technologies demonstrating high accuracy in detection of PTSD signals in textual documents.

AB Background: In 2000, the USDHHS released Healthy People 2010 (HP2010), a series of disease prevention and health promotion objectives for the nation. Thirty-nine of these objectives were dedicated to injury prevention and six of these objectives related to adolescents, who were tracked through CDC's National Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS).
   Purpose: This paper uses national YRBS data from 1999 to 2009 to analyze overall and subgroup trends and determine progress toward targets for the following HP2010 objectives: seatbelt use (HP2010 objective 15-19); motorcycle helmet use (15-21); riding with a driver who had been drinking alcohol (26-6); physical fighting (15-38); weapon carrying on school property (15-39); and suicide attempts requiring medical attention (18-2).
   Methods: The CDC conducted the national YRBS biennially from 1999 to 2009 and used similar three-stage cluster-sample designs to obtain representative samples of high school students in the U. S. This study was conducted in 2010 and used linear and quadratic time variables simultaneously in logistic regression models while controlling for gender, race/ethnicity, and grade to test for secular trends over time.
   Results: Only two objectives met their HP2010 targets: riding with a driver who had been drinking alcohol (26-6) and physical fighting (15-38). Progress was seen for four additional objectives and within some subgroups.
   Conclusions: Substantial policy and practice changes must occur if the recently released Healthy People 2020 targets are to be met. School-, community-, and state-level policies and programs may be effective tools to prevent injuries and victimizations.

AB Background: Allergies are among the most common chronic conditions. In addition to physical and social impacts, a number of studies have consistently linked allergies to poor psychological outcomes, including depression and anxiety.
   Objectives: The aim of the present systematic literature review was to analyze the existing literature about the relationship between allergies and fatal and nonfatal suicidal behaviors.
   Methods: Data sources include articles retrieved from Scopus, PubMed, ProQuest, and Web of Knowledge. Search terms: "suicid* and (allerg* or hay fever or atop* or eczema or aeroallergen*)" in English-language peer-reviewed journals between 1990 and 2014.
   Eligibility Criteria: Original research articles that provide empiric evidence about the potential link between allergies and suicidal behaviors.
   Results: The initial search identified a total of 769 articles with 17 original research articles that present empiric evidence. Nine articles analyzed the relationship between allergies and fatal suicidal behavior, and nine analyzed nonfatal suicidal behaviors (one article included both). There currently is little research into the relationship between allergies and suicidal behavior. Limitations: The review was restricted to English-language articles published within the chosen time period; other limitations included the small number of articles that involve suicide mortality, and the fact that the majority of articles originated from the United States and Scandinavia.
   Conclusions: Analysis of the results indicates a link between allergies and suicidality, particularly suicide mortality; however, results for nonfatal suicidal behaviors are mixed. It is important that further research by using more rigorous study designs be carried out to lend strength to these findings.

AB Background: Recently, item responses and total scores on depression screening scales have been reported to have characteristic distributions in the general population. The distributional pattern of responses to the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) in the general population has not been well studied. Thus, we carried out a pattern analysis of the PHQ-9 item responses and total scores in US adults.
   Methods: Data (5372 individuals) were drawn from the 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the United States. The item responses and total score distributions of the PHQ-9 data were investigated with graphical analysis and exponential regression model.
   Results: Lines of item responses showed the same pattern among the nine items, characterized by crossing at a single point between "not at all" and "several days" and a parallel pattern from "several days" to "nearly every day" on a log-normal scale. The total score distribution of the PHQ-9 exhibited an exponential pattern, except for at the lower end of the distribution.
   Conclusions: The present results support that the item responses and total scores on the PHQ-9 in the general population show the same characteristic patterns, consistent with the previous studies using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and Kessler Screening Scale for Psychological Distress (K6).

AB IntroductionDespite the seriousness of the event, maternal deaths are substantially underreported. There is often a missed opportunity to learn from such tragedies. The aim of the study was to identify maternal deaths in the five Nordic countries, to classify causes of death based on internationally acknowledged criteria, and to identify areas that would benefit from further teaching, training or research to possibly reduce the number of maternal deaths.
   Material and methodsWe present data for the years 2005-2013. National audit groups collected data by linkage of registers and direct reporting from hospitals. Each case was then assessed to determine the cause of death, and level of care provided. Potential improvements to care were evaluated.
   ResultsWe registered 168 maternal deaths, 90 direct and 78 indirect cases. The maternal mortality ratio was 7.2/100 000 live births ranging from 6.8 to 8.1 between the countries. Cardiac disease (n = 29) was the most frequent cause of death, followed by preeclampsia (n = 24), thromboembolism (n = 20) and suicide (n = 20). Improvements to care which could potentially have made a difference to the outcome were identified in one-third of the deaths, i.e. in as many as 60% of preeclamptic, 45% of thromboembolic, and 32% of the deaths from cardiac disease.
   ConclusionDirect deaths exceeded indirect maternal deaths in the Nordic countries. To reduce maternal deaths, increased efforts to better implement existing clinical guidelines seem warranted, particularly for preeclampsia, thromboembolism and cardiac disease. More knowledge is also needed about what contributes to suicidal maternal deaths.

AB Aims
   This study evaluated features that differentiate subtypes of major depressive episode (MDE) in the context of substance dependence (SD).
   Design
   Secondary data analysis using pooled data from family-based and case-control genetic studies of SD.
   Setting
   Community recruitment through academic medical centers.
   Participants
   A total of 1929 unrelated subjects with alcohol and/or drug dependence.
   Measurements
   Demographics, diagnostic criteria for psychiatric and substance use disorders and related clinical features were obtained using the Semi-Structured Assessment for Drug Dependence and Alcoholism. We compared four groups: no life-time MDE (no MDE), independent MDE only (I-MDE), substance-induced MDE only (SI-MDE) and both types of MDE.
   Findings
   Psychiatric measures were better predictors of MDE subtype than substance-related or socio-demographic ones. Subjects with both types of MDE reported more life-time depressive symptoms and comorbid anxiety disorders and were more likely to have attempted suicide than subjects with I-MDE or SI-MDE. Subjects with both types of MDE, like those with I-MDE, were also more likely than subjects with SI-MDE to be alcohol-dependent only than either drug-dependent only or both alcohol- and drug-dependent.
   Conclusions
   SD individuals with both types of MDE have greater psychiatric severity than those with I-MDE only or SI-MDE only. These and other features that distinguish among the MDE subtypes have important diagnostic and potential therapeutic implications.

AB This study explores connections between inward-directed violence and outward-directed violence using data from the Reach for Health sample, which was originally recruited in the 1990s from three middle schools in economically distressed, predominantly African American neighborhoods of New York City. Now in their thirties, participants (N = 595) completed surveys assessing current suicidal thoughts and behaviors as well as other violence involvements, including intimate partner violence victimization and perpetration. About 10% of males and females reported any suicidal ideation or attempt in the past 12 months. In logistic regression analyses adjusting for sociodemographics, prior reports of feeling blue in middle school (OR: 1.12, CI: 1.02-4.39) and young adult suicidality (OR: 2.54, CI: 1.30-4.95) are significantly related to later suicidality. So are concurrent aggressive behaviors, including reports of physical fighting outside the home (OR: 2.70, CI: 1.29-5.67) and IPV perpetration (OR: 2.09, CI: 1.11-3.94). Neither IPV victimization nor witnessing neighborhood violence is correlated. Findings shed light on the persistence of suicidality in the lives of those who come of age, and often remain, in communities with high levels of poverty, and confirm linkages of suicidality with externally directed aggression. Life-stage interventions are needed to counter the interwoven causes and consequences of multiple forms of violence.

AB Objective: Most youths experiencing a psychiatric crisis present to emergency departments (EDs) that lack the specialized staff to evaluate them, so youths are often discharged without appropriate mental health assessment or treatment. To better understand the needs of this population, this study described clinical details and disposition associated with visits for psychiatric emergencies to a specialized ED staffed 24/7 by child psychiatrists.
   Methods: Through retrospective chart review, 1,180 visits to the ED during its first year of operation were reviewed for clinical characteristics, prior service utilization, and demographic characteristics. Bivariate analyses (chi-square test and Wilcoxon rank sum test) compared differences in disposition (evaluate and release, brief stabilization, and inpatient psychiatric admission) associated with characteristics of the children's first visit (N = 885). Measures with bivariate association of p < .10 were further assessed by using multinomial logistic regression analyses.
   Results: For most visits (59%), children were evaluated and released, 13% were briefly stabilized, and 28% were admitted for psychiatric treatment. Youths with mood or psychotic disorders were more likely to be admitted, as were those with current suicidality or aggression. Many youths who presented with aggression were also identified as having suicidality or self-harm.
   Conclusions: Clinical factors, especially suicidality, predicted psychiatric admission. Admission rates for youths with suicidality were significantly higher in this study than previously reported, suggesting the availability of child psychiatrists in this ED allowed greater ascertainment of suicide risk (and thus hospitalization to mitigate that risk) than occurs in EDs without such staffing.

AB Objective: To evaluate whether the DSM distinction between uncomplicated (normal) and complicated (disordered) bereavement-related depression (BRD) has discriminant validity on a range of pathology indicators. The DSMs major depression bereavement exclusion (BE) excludes BRDs from diagnosis when they are uncomplicated (defined by brief duration, non-severe impairment, and lack of certain pathosuggestive symptoms) but classifies all other (complicated) BRDs as major depression. A previous report seemed to support the uncomplicated/complicated distinctions discriminant validity. However, those arguing for eliminating the BE from DSM-5 dismiss the findings as tautological, attributing the validator differences to definitional biases (e.g. uncomplicated requires no suicidal ideation, yet lifetime suicide attempt was a validator). This study empirically tests whether the uncomplicated/complicated differences are real or tautological. Method: Using National Comorbidity Survey data, confounds between definitional criteria for uncomplicated and pathology validators were identified and corrected by deleting the biasing criteria and recalculating the corresponding validators outcome. Results: Six validators (interference with life, suicide attempt, melancholic depression, duration, hospitalization, and number of symptoms) were reanalyzed using unbiased definitions for uncomplicated. All still yielded significantly lower pathology levels for uncomplicated BRDs, disconfirming the tautology hypothesis. Regression analysis revealed that uncomplicated offered incremental validity over severity alone in predicting pathology, so uncomplicated cannot be equated with mild. Conclusion: Uncomplicated BRDs lower pathology validator levels are because of real syndromal differences, not definitional tautologies, supporting the BEs validity.

TI Case report of a fatal intoxication by citalopram
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FORENSIC MEDICINE AND PATHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE citalopram; fatal intoxication; suicide
ID OVERDOSE; TOXICITY; SUICIDE; ANTIDEPRESSANTS
AB Citalopram is an antidepressant drug within the group of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). It is widely prescribed both in Europe and in United States, and it has always been considered a "safe" drug as pure intoxication with lethal outcome is rare, and most cases of overdose, even with high doses of citalopram ingested, are reported to have an uneventful course.
   We report the case of a young woman found dead at home. She had been prescribed citalopram by her family doctor 3 weeks before her death for a depressive syndrome. Police found in her house 3 empty blister packages of 28 citalopram tablets (20 mg) and 2 bottles of citalopram oral solution (4%, 15 mL each). The autopsy findings were unremarkable. Nasal swabs, blood from femoral vein, urine, bile and tissue samples were collected for toxicologic investigation. Citalopram separation was performed by solid/liquid method, using Bond-Elute columns. The extracts were analyzed by GLC and GC/MS methods. The toxicologic analysis showed high levels of citalopram in all the examined fluids and tissue samples (blood concentration: 11.60 mg/L). No other drugs and alcohol were detected. Our data confirm that if no other drug is involved, fatal complications occur only after ingestion of very high doses. However, there is no predefined "toxic dose," and the conditions under which the overdose occurs can be very important. We report the exact concentrations of the citalopram in the organs, and we think that this can be useful in the cases where the blood samples were not available (ie, carbonized or decomposed body).

DT Review

   PATTERNS; CULTURE; INJURY; ABUSE
AB Suicide attempts by self-immolation are relatively rare in North America, but the physical, psychological, and social effects on the patients, families, and staff are significant. An understanding of the characteristics of the self-inflicted burn population is imperative to better inform acute, postacute, and long-term care. The goal of the present systematic review is to summarize existing literature findings on self-inflicted burns in the United States. Seven databases were searched for articles published between 1970 and 2011 in the English language, which investigated self-burning. Thirty-two articles met selection criteria for inclusion. Review of the literature revealed that published studies on self-inflicted burns are scarce, inconclusive, and weak in design. Most studies contained limited contextual information and limited data on the long-term outcomes of survivors of self-inflicted burn injuries. Despite lack of consistency in data-collection methods and contradictory findings across studies, this review provides insight into both the characteristics of self-immolators and the context in which self-immolation events occur. A picture emerged of a group of individuals who act impulsively in the context of psychiatric and or alcohol/drug disorder, and individuals who may be reacting to stressful life events and loss. Although sparse, the existing data examining long-term outcomes in the self-inflicted burn population indicate that survivors can be successfully rehabilitated, provided that early and intense psychiatric and social interventions are in place. Future investigations are needed to further inform the development of best practices for every phase of treatment and recovery of self-inflicted burn survivors.

TI Occult Suicidality and Psychiatric Disease Among Emergency Department
   Patients with Low-acuity Chief Complaints
SO WESTERN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID PRIMARY-CARE; RISK; INTERVENTION; DEPRESSION; SERVICES; IDEATION; VISITS
AB Introduction: Patients presenting to emergency departments (ED) are often screened for suicidality, even when their chief complaint does not involve mental health concerns. Patient receptiveness to EDbased mental health screening and intervention is unknown, particularly among patients with low-acuity chief complaints, who often prioritize rapid evaluation and discharge.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study included adults with low-acuity chief complaints presenting to an urban, academic ED in the Northeastern United States during daytime and evening hours, from 2015 to 2016. Participants completed validated mental health screening instruments, including the Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised and the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. Participants were also asked to rate the importance of addressing mental health concerns during their ED visit.
   Results: We approached 1,688 patients, and 816 (48.4%) consented to participate in the study. Of these, 27% screened positive for anxiety and 25% screened positive for depression. Even among patients with no prior depression history, 17% were at high risk of depression. Eleven percent of participants were at high risk for suicidal behavior, including 5% of those with no reported history of depression or bipolar disorder. Thirty-five percent of patients at risk for suicide and 53% of those at high risk of depression thought it was important or very important to address these issues during the ED visit.
   Conclusion: Symptoms of mental health disorders were common among this group of ED patients presenting with low-acuity chief complaints. Patients often desired to address these mental health concerns as part of their ED visit.

AB Objective: To examine the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) on suicidal ideation among Veterans with insomnia.
   Design: Longitudinal data collected in the course of an uncontrolled evaluation of a large-scale CBT-I training program.
   Setting: Outpatient and residential treatment facilities.
   Participants: Four hundred five Veterans presenting for treatment of insomnia.
   Interventions: Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia.
   Measurement and Results: At baseline, 32% of patients, compared with 21% at final assessment, endorsed some level of suicidal ideation [chi(2)(df = 1) = 125; P < 0.001]. After adjusting for demographic variables and baseline insomnia severity, each 7-point decrease in Insomnia Severity Index score achieved during CBT-I treatment was associated with a 65% (odds ratio = 0.35; 95% confidence intervals = 0.24 to 0.52) reduction in odds of suicidal ideation. The effect of change in insomnia severity on change in depression severity was also significant. After controlling for change in depression severity and other variables in the model, the effect of change in insomnia severity on change in suicidal ideation remained significant.
   Conclusion: This evaluation of the largest dissemination of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in the United States found a clinically meaningful reduction in suicidal ideation among Veterans receiving CBT-I. The mechanisms by which effective treatment of insomnia with CBT-I reduces suicide risk are unknown and warrant investigation. The current results may have significant public health implications for preventing suicide among Veterans.

DT Article
ID PAIN; BEHAVIOR; GENDER; DRUG
AB OBJECTIVES: This study analyzes and compares exposures to prescription opioids among children and adolescents younger than 20 years old in the United States.
   METHODS: Data from the National Poison Data System for 2000 through 2015 were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Poison control centers received reports of 188 468 prescription opioid exposures among children aged <20 years old from 2000 through 2015. The annual number and rate of exposures increased early in the study period, but declined after 2009, except for buprenorphine exposures, which increased during the last 3 study years. Hydrocodone accounted for the largest proportion of exposures (28.7%), and 47.1% of children exposed to buprenorphine were admitted to a health care facility (HCF). The odds of being admitted to an HCF were higher for teenagers than for children aged 0 to 5 years (odds ratio [OR]: 2.86; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.78-2.94) or children aged 6 to 12 years (OR: 6.62; 95% CI: 6.06-7.02). Teenagers also had greater odds of serious medical outcomes than did children aged 0 to 5 years (OR: 3.03; 95% CI: 2.92-3.15) or children aged 6 to 12 years (OR: 4.59; 95% CI: 4.21-5.00). The rate of prescription opioid-related suspected suicides among teenagers increased by 52.7% during the study period.
   CONCLUSIONS: Prescription opioid-related HCF admissions and serious medical outcomes were higher among teenagers. Contrary to trends for other prescription opioids, exposures to buprenorphine have increased in recent years; children aged 0 to 5 years accounted for almost 90% of buprenorphine exposures. These findings indicate that additional prevention efforts are needed.

AB Background: There has never been a nationally representative survey of medical students' personal health-related practices, although they are inherently of interest and may affect students' patient-counseling practices.
   Methods: To determine basic health practices and status, a survey was conducted of medical students (n =2316 individuals responding to >= 1 survey) in the Class of 2003 at freshman orientation, entrance to wards, and senior year in a nationally representative sample of 16 medical schools (response rate=80.3%).
   Results: Most medical students (84%) reported never having smoked cigarettes, and both genders typically drank two drinks per drinking episode (with bingeing more common among men). Students exercised a median of at least 4 hours per week, and preferred strenuous exercise. Medical students across all years and both genders reported a median of 7 hours of sleep per night. Nearly all (97%) reported their health to be at least good, typically with I or fewer days of poor physical or mental health in the past month. Both genders (particularly women) were unlikely to be overweight or obese. Reported rates of any chronic condition were <= 2% except for hypertension among men, and obesity, dyslipidemia, and depression in both genders. Unlike their other relatively positive behaviors compared with their peers, medical students had variable rates of preventive screening.
   Conclusions: Medical students in the United States were healthy, and reported many good health behaviors when compared with other young U.S. adults. However, for some, health behaviors and personal health practices either did not meet national goals or placed students at risk.

   SUICIDE; FATALITIES; EMPHASIS; SHOCK
AB Deaths due to the passage of electric current through the body are most often accidental, although suicides and homicides may occasionally occur. Electrical energy represents electron flow, or current, between two points with different potentials, measured in voltage. The amount of current is determined by the resistance of the conducting material. Electrocutions involving humans may be due to low voltages (< 1000 V), high voltage (> 1000 V), or to lightning. Deaths are caused by a direct effect of current on the heart, resulting in ventricular fibrillation, on respiratory muscles resulting in respiratory paralysis or on the brainstem respiratory centers. Deaths may also be caused by thermal effects of current, or by trauma or drowning associated with exposure to an electrical current, or to multiorgan failure complicating initial injuries. The autopsy assessment of possible electrocution is complicated by the non-specificity and subtlety of lesions. Victims may have classical targetoid electrical burns of the skin with central charring, surrounding pallor and hyperemic rims. There may also be adjacent nodules of burnt keratin due to arcing of current. Victims of lightning strikes may demonstrate the typical ferning pattern of Lichtenberg figures. Conversely, other cases, e. g., electrocutions occurring in water, may have no pathological indicators of electrical injury. For this reason, the investigation of possible electrocution requires careful evaluation of the death scene and assessment of the electrical safety of the building and any electrical equipment that had been used. Meticulous examination of all body surfaces for subtle electrical burns with histological sampling is also required.

AB The aim of this study was to estimate the role of victimization by violence among Mexican adolescents that have considered or attempted migrating to the United States, including mental health variables (emotional self-esteem, self-esteem in school, depression, suicidal ideation, and attempted suicide) as mediators of the effects. The study used a cross-sectional design with a stratified cluster sample of 13,198 adolescents from the 2nd Mexican National Survey on Exclusion, Intolerance, and Violence in public schools in 2009. The analysis used the regression models proposed by Baron & Kenny. Prevalence of having considered or attempted cross-border migration was 23.1%. Mean age was 16.36 years. Female adolescents constituted 54.9% of the sample, and 56% were lower-income. Mental health variables that acted as partial mediators were suicidal ideation (35.9%), depression (19.2%), attempted suicide (17.7%), emotional self-esteem (6.2%), and self-esteem in school (3.4%) for moderate family violence, and emotional self-esteem (17.5%) for social rejection in school and suicidal ideation (8.1%) for physical harm in school. Female adolescents showed greater impact from mediators than men in considering or having attempted cross-border migration. The study discusses the importance of incorporating the prevention of violence in the social contexts studied here and incorporating mental health in dealing with violence in adolescents and in public health programs in transit areas for illegal migrants.

AB There are millions of Americans who are systematically forgotten and mistreated by our government. They have been described by the Supreme Court as "alien races" and "utterly unfit for American citizenship," but they continue to fight and die defending our Constitution. They survive catastrophic storms, but do not receive the assistance that is freely given to other Americans. They are subject to federal laws and regulations, but have no meaningful voice or vote in Washington. They are the millions of Americans in Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the US Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands-the unincorporated territories of the United States.
   This Article is about these forgotten Americans, their longstanding political plight, and the pragmatic legal policies that could improve their lives and make them fully and equally American. It begins by providing a brief overview of each territory. Next, it investigates the plight of the territories, focusing on how interconnected factors relating to political powerlessness, economic dependence, military presence, and geographic isolation have created heavy burdens for people in the territories. Moving from problems to solutions, this Article examines past efforts to aid the territories. In particular, it analyzes past pursuits of litigation, statehood, and independence. It explains why these prior paths did not lead to progress, and discloses critical obstacles that continue to obstruct these routes. Finally, this Article proposes three workable ways for the federal government to assist the territories in the near term. Specifically, it argues that the territories and their supporters should focus on working with the federal government to obtain: (1) an extended temporary waiver of the costly maritime law known as the Jones Act, (2) most-favored state status in federal veterans and disaster relief appropriations, and (3) special economic empowerment zone designations. Ultimately, this Article aspires to offer a new, workable roadmap for policymakers to think and act with greater urgency about the forgotten Americans of our territories.

DT Article

   DEPRESSION; SAMPLE; FAMILY
AB Objective: In clinical samples, body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is associated with substantial suffering and reduced quality of life. Limited surveys report widely varying prevalence estimates. To better establish the prevalence of BDD, we conducted a United States nationwide prevalence survey.
   Method: We conducted a random sample national household telephone survey in the spring and summer of 2004 and interviewed 2,513 adults, of whom 2,048 qualified for the BDD-module administration. The computer-assisted, structured interviews, conducted by trained lay interviewers, addressed Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria for BDD, along with information regarding several impulse-control disorders and the respondents' financial and demographic data.
   Results: The rate of response was 56.3%, which compared favorably with rates in federal national health surveys. The cooperation rate was 97.6%. Respondents included a higher percentage of women and people 55 years of age than in the US adult population, and a lower percentage of Hispanics. The estimated point prevalence of DSM-IV BDD among respondents was 2.4% (49/2,048) (by gender: 2.5% for women, 2.2% for men), exceeding the prevalence of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder type 1 and about that of generalized anxiety disorder. BDD prevalence decreased after 44 years of age, and a larger proportion of BDD respondents were never married. Of those meeting DSM-IV criteria for BDD, 90% (45/49) met the DSM-IV distress criterion, and 51% (25/49) met the interference-with-functioning criterion.
   Conclusion: A study using clinically valid interviews is needed to evaluate these results. Such studies could inform treatment by documenting rates of seeking treatment from various sources, suicide attempt rates, and the prevalence of comorbid conditions.

AB The implementation of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 resulted in a decision by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency to phase out and eliminate the use of organophosphate insecticides in residential environments. The phase-out and cancellation process began in the year 2000 and was complete in 2005. The purpose of this investigation was to utilize national Poison Control Center data to assess whether the risk mitigation decision had an impact on the number of incident cases involving organophosphates in the United States. Organophosphate exposure incident data were extracted from Annual Reports of the American Association of Poison Control Centers Toxic Exposure Surveillance System (TESS) for the years 1995 to 2004. The number of organophosphate exposure incidents peaked at 20,135 in 1997, and declined in each subsequent year. A statistically significant decrease was observed in the average annual number of organophosphate exposure incidents when comparing data from the time periods before (1995-1999) and after (2000-2004) the commencement of the phase-out process. The decrease in organophosphate incident cases was observed for all age categories, as well as for the circumstances surrounding the exposure ( unintentional and intentional exposure incidents). TESS data showed a significant decrease in incident cases involving organophosphates in association with the phase-out from residential uses. The results of this investigation are consistent with other studies that have reported that regulatory restriction of access to pesticide formulations may have a significant impact on the number of human exposure incidents.

AB Purpose: This study examined internalized transnegativity and psychological distress in two age groups of transgender individuals who identified their gender identity on the feminine spectrum (rather than congruent with their male sex assigned at birth). Due to greater visibility and acceptance of gender diversity in the United States, we hypothesized that internalized transnegativity would be lower in the younger compared with the older group, and that the younger generation would, therefore, report lower levels of psychological distress than the older generation.
   Methods: The study sample consisted of trans-feminine individuals (N=440) who completed a online survey of the U.S. transgender population and comprised a younger group aged 18-24 years (n=133) and an older group aged 40 years and older (n=307). Internalized transnegativity was assessed using the Transgender Identity Survey, and psychological distress was assessed with the Brief Symptom Inventory 18. We used regression and mediation analysis to examine differences between the two groups.
   Results: Contrary to our expectations, the older group reported significantly lower levels of both internalized transnegativity and psychological distress compared with the younger group. Internalized transnegativity partially mediated the relationship between age group and psychological distress.
   Conclusion: Despite greater visibility of transgender people and increasing acceptance of gender diversity in the United States, the younger trans-feminine individuals reported more psychological distress than the older transfeminine individuals, which was, in part, related to internalized transnegativity. Trans-feminine individuals may benefit from culturally sensitive and clinically competent mental health services to alleviate internalized transnegativity and psychological distress.

AB Background: While the comorbidity of mental health and injecting heroin has been documented, current research is limited by describing the mental health of people who inject drugs without a comparison group and by the lack of research on nontreatment samples in the United States, particularly among Hispanics. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of injecting history (never, former, occasional, and daily) and multiple outcomes of global and mental health using a sample of U.S.-based Latinos not currently in treatment.
   Methods: Data are from a sample of street-recruited Mexican American young adult men (n = 275) in San Antonio, TX. Multiple logistic regression and structural equation modeling were used.
   Results: Overall 54% of men reported lifetime injecting drug use (20.7% former users, 11.1% occasional users, and 21.9% daily users). We found varying prevalence rates of global and mental health status among different histories of injecting. After covariate adjustment, daily injecting remained strongly associated with all four outcomes: perceived poor health status (AOR = 4.39; p <= 0.001), psychological distress (AOR = 2.78; p <= 0.05), depression (AOR = 4.37; p <= 0.001), and suicidal ideation (OR = 4.75; p <= 0.001). Acculturation, gang membership, and incarceration history also emerged as important factors.
   Conclusion: This study provides new information about the relationship between mental health and injecting heroin use.
   Findings: Support the need to consider mental health states among people who inject drugs, and to examine varying histories of injecting with socially and culturally relevant factors.

AB Purpose:To describe the suggested clinical practice of palliative sedation as it is presented in the literature and discuss available guidelines for its use.Methods:CINAHL, PubMed, and Web of Science were searched for publications since 1997 for recommended guidelines and position statements on palliative sedation as well as data on its provision. Keywords included palliative sedation, terminal sedation, guidelines, United States, and end of life. Inclusion criteria were palliative sedation policies, frameworks, guidelines, or discussion of its practice, general or oncology patient population, performance of the intervention in an inpatient unit, for humans, and in English. Exclusion criteria were palliative sedation in children, acute illness, procedural, or burns, and predominantly ethical discussions.Results:Guidelines were published by American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine (2000), Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association (2003), American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine (2006), American Medical Association (2008), Royal Dutch Medical Association (2009), European Association for Palliative Care (2009), National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (2010), and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2012). Variances throughout guidelines include definitions of the practice, indications for its use, continuation of life-prolonging therapies, medications used, and timing/prognosis.Recommendations:The development and implementation of institutional-based guidelines with clear stance on the discussed variances is necessary for consistency in practice. Data on provision of palliative sedation after implementation of guidelines needs to be collected and disseminated for a better understanding of the current practice in the United States.

AB Purpose: To examine the trajectory of suicidal ideation in relation to perceived overweight from adolescence to young adulthood.
   Methods: Four waves (1995-2008) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health that prospectively followed up a nationally representative sample of United States middle and high school students (N = 6,504) were analyzed using hierarchical generalized linear models with a logit link function.
   Results: Overall, suicidal ideation tended to decrease with age (logit coefficient [coef.] = -.07, p < .001). Participants who perceived themselves as overweight were more likely to think about committing suicide, especially in females, even after controlling for rigorously measured depressive symptoms (coef. = .14, p < .01). Girls were more likely than boys to have suicidal ideation at age 10 (coef. = -.31, p < .001). However, the association between suicidal ideation and perceived overweight became weaker and the prevalence of suicidal ideation became lower as participants grew older. The downward trend in suicidal ideation was steeper in females than in males (coef. = .03, p < .001), with males actually showing a higher prevalence of suicidal ideation than females around 20-30 years of age. Random effects of age, depression, and perceived overweight were insignificant, which indicated that participants did not vary significantly in terms of effects of these variables on suicidal ideation.
   Conclusions: The results of this study underline the need for development of family, school, and community interventions to address body weight perception to reduce suicidal ideation and attempts, especially among female teenagers.

DT Article

AB Objective: Few investigations have examined screening and intervention procedures for comorbid substance use and mental disorders at trauma centers in the United States, although these disorders are endemic among survivors of traumatic injury. In 2006, the American College of Surgeons (ACS) mandated that level I and level II trauma centers screen for alcohol use problems and that level I centers provide brief intervention for those who screen positive. The ACS is expected to recommend best practice policy guidelines for screening for drug use problems and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study examined screening and intervention procedures for the full spectrum of comorbid mental and substance use disorders at U.S. trauma centers. Methods: Respondents at all level I and level II trauma centers (N=518) in the United States were asked to complete a survey describing screening and intervention procedures for alcohol and drug use problems, suicidality, depression, and PTSD. Results: There were 391 (75%) respondents. Over 80% of trauma centers routinely screened for alcohol and drug use problems. Routine screening and intervention for suicidality, depression, and PTSD were markedly less common; in fact, only 7% of centers reported routine screening for PTSD. Consistent with ACS policy, level I centers were significantly more likely than level II centers to provide alcohol intervention. Conclusions: Alcohol screening and intervention occurred frequently at U.S. trauma centers and appeared to be responsive to ACS mandates. In the future, efforts to orchestrate clinical investigation and policy could enhance screening and intervention procedures for highly prevalent, comorbid mental disorders.

LA English
DT Article
ID FIREARM-RELATED DEATHS; TRAUMA CARE SYSTEMS; SUICIDE
AB Objective: To compare injury case fatality rates in the United States ( US) with New Zealand ( NZ) to guide future information collection, research, and evaluation.
   Design: Using NZ ( 1992 - 96) and US ( 1996 - 98) mortality censuses, NZ national 1992 - 96 hospital discharge censuses, and US 1996 - 98 National Hospital Discharge Survey data, the authors compared case fatality rates by mechanism and intent of injury and age group. The analysis was restricted to severe injuries ( AIS >= 3).
   Subjects: NZ ( 1992 - 96) and US ( 1996 - 98) populations.
   Main outcome measures: Ratio of case fatality rates in NZ versus the US ( RCFR( NZ: US)).
   Results: Overall, among cases meeting the study criteria, unintentional injuries were 1.57 times more likely fatal in NZ and intentional assault injuries were 1.14 times more likely to be fatal in the US. Firearms were involved in 50% of US assaults versus 8% of NZ assaults. By mechanism, cutting/ piercing injuries were 1.86, firearm injuries were 1.41, and motor vehicle injuries were 1.44 times more to be likely fatal in NZ. Natural/ environmental injuries ( RCFRNZ: US = 0.57), unintentional poisonings ( RCFRNZ: US = 0.26), and unintentional suffocations ( RCFRNZ: US = 0.67) were significantly more likely to be fatal in the US.
   Conclusions: Possible reasons for the observed results include: differences in geography and proportion of population in rural areas, trauma system differences, road design and vehicle types, seat belt use, larger role of firearms in US assaults, coding practices, policies, and environmental factors. Disparities evoke hypotheses to test in future research that will guide priority setting and intervention.

AB Purpose of the Study: This study aims to further our understanding of the experiences of physicians when discussing physician-assisted dying (PAD) within the context of doctor-patient relationships in various sociolegal settings. Although patients bring up PAD in diverse settings, little is known about how physicians experience these discussions, and such experiences have not been directly compared across countries. Design and Methods: A total of 36 physicians in the Netherlands and the United States (including Oregon) were interviewed using individual semistructured interview guides. Interviews were conducted by a single interviewer, audiotaped, and independently transcribed. Inductive qualitative analysis, aided by NVivo7 software, directed purposive sampling of physicians until saturation was met. Multiple coders in a multidisciplinary team analyzed emerging themes and developed theory. Results: PAD discussions, which ranged from theoretical discussions to actual requests, could be gateways to discussions of other end-of-life issues important to patients and could strengthen doctor-patient relationships. Physicians found discussions to be emotionally intense, but often rewarding. Where PAD was legal, physicians utilized existing criteria to guide communication, and discussions were open and honest with patients and colleagues. Where PAD was illegal, conversations were less explicit, and physicians dealt with requests in relative isolation. In addition, physicians' views of their professional role, patients' rights, and religion influenced both their willingness to have and the content of PAD discussions. Implications: Discussion of PAD is an energy-consuming, yet potentially enriching part of the doctor-patient relationship. Legal guidelines may help to provide structure and support for physicians when patients broach the topic of PAD.

AB Background: Russia has made substantial, largely unrecognized contributions to the field of trauma. These include the early development of triage, improvement of blood transfusions and blood bank networks, and Mobile Emergency Medical Services. Despite these advances, injury fatality rates in Russia are alarmingly high (similar to 50% higher than other Eastern European countries). They fluctuated dramatically during 1980 to 2006, a period that included the dissolution of Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Suggested causes, including inaccurate data, alcohol use, and economic hardship, are investigated in this article.
   Methods: Injury mortality rates for homicide, suicide, accidental poisoning, and total injuries (source: World Health Organization), alcohol consumption (source: World Health Organization), and economic data (source: United Nations Economic Commission for Europe) for the Russian Federation from 1980 to 2006 were examined and compared with the Baltic States, Central Asian Republics, other Eastern European nations, and the United States.
   Results: Injury mortality rates declined in Russia from 1980 to 1987. The total injury mortality rate more than doubled between 1987 and 1994, followed by a 40% decline from 1994 to 1998. The 1984 to 1994 mortality rates generally parallel alcohol consumption trends. The 1991 to 1994 climb coincides with the dissolution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. A smaller rise in fatality rates occurred in the early 2000s.
   Conclusions: Deaths caused by injuries in the Russian Federation are related to multiple factors. Some authors conclude that the data accurately reflect injury mortality. Financial concerns during these times may have led to riskier behaviors resulting in more deaths from injuries. Heavy alcohol consumption also likely contributes to high injury mortality rates. Excessive injury mortality calls for action by Russian policy makers.

TI Rural Versus Urban Hospitalizations for Firearm Injuries in Children and

DT Article

AB OBJECTIVES: Firearms are a leading cause of injury and death for children and adolescents in the United States. We examined how hospitalization rates for firearm injuries differ for rural and urban populations.
   METHODS: The Kids' Inpatient Database was used to identify hospitalizations for firearm injuries in patients <20 years of age by using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision external-cause-of-injury codes. Data from 2006, 2009, and 2012 were analyzed-to compare demographics and intent (assault, self-inflicted, unintentional, and undetermined). Urban-rural classification was based on patients' county of residence. Rates were calculated by using weighted cases and US Census data.
   RESULTS: There were 21 581 hospitalizations for firearm injuries. The overall hospitalization rate was higher in urban versus rural areas (risk ratio [RR] = 1.95; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.81-2.10). Rates were highest for assaults in urban 15-to 19-year-olds (RR = 7.82; 95% CI: 6.48-9.44). Unintentional injuries were the leading cause of hospitalizations in younger age groups in all urban and rural locations. Rates for unintentional injuries were lower among urban versus rural 5-to 9-year-olds (RR = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.36-0.63) and 10-to 14-year-olds (RR = 0.44; 95% CI: 0.37-0.52).
   CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalizations for firearm assaults among urban 15-to 19-year-olds represent the highest injury rate. Notably, hospitalizations are lower for urban versus rural 5-to 9-year-olds and 10-to 14-year-olds, and unintentional firearm injuries are most common among these groups. Preventative public health approaches should address these differences in injury epidemiology.

AB Objectives: To describe demographic and disability-related characteristics, to examine the patterns of treatment for depression, and to investigate correlates of depression severity and predictors of who receives treatment among a sample of depressed rural women with physical disabilities.
   Design: A correlational analysis of data gathered from women recruited for a depression intervention study.
   Setting: Rural centers for independent living located in nine different states across the United States.
   Participants: Women (N = 134) who reported at least mild depression and expressed interest in participating in a depression intervention study.
   Main Outcomes Measures: Depressive symptomatology based on the Beck Depression Inventory-II; treatment for depression in the past 3 months.
   Results: The majority of participants reported moderate to severe depression (n = 101, 75.4%), with nearly 20% reporting thoughts of suicide. At risk of severe depression were women who were younger, had greater problems with pain, had more limited mobility, and were less satisfied with their social network. Despite the high levels of depressive symptomatology in the sample, more than one third of the women had not received recent treatment for depression.
   Conclusion: This study suggests that depression and access to treatment are critical issues for women with physical disabilities living in rural areas.

AB The average reported age of sexual debut for youth in the United States is 14.4 years, with approximately 7% reporting their sexual debut prior to age 13. While the research literature on sexual debut for youth addresses gender and ethnic differences (with males and African-American youth experiencing earlier sexual debut), there is limited data regarding factors associated with sexual debut for young men who have sex with men (YMSM). Early sexual debut poses potential health risks, such as contracting HIV with an increased risk of unprotected intercourse. Given current high HIV infection rates for racial/ethnic minority YMSM, learning more about their sexual debuts and associated risk factors of this population is of great importance. This study investigated risk behaviors and emotional distress, and their association with MSM sexual debut for a multisite cohort of racial/ethnic minority YMSM living with HIV. We hypothesized that a MSM sexual debut younger than age 16 would be associated with engagement in more high-risk sexual behaviors (unprotected sex and exchange sex), substance use, and emotional distress than a MSM sexual debut at age 16 or older. Results indicated that participants having a MSM sexual debut before the age of 16 reported more exchange sex; drug use (specifically marijuana); emotional/psychological problems related to substance use; and a history of suicide attempts, compared to participants with later MSM sexual debuts. Comprehensive interventions that are racially/ethnically sensitive, inquire about initial sexual experiences, and focus on sexual health and healthy relationships are needed to improve health outcomes for this population.

AB Introduction: Overdose is a leading cause of injury and death in the United States. Emergency Department (ED) patients have an elevated prevalence of substance use, This study describes overdose/adverse drug event experiences among adult ED patients to inform strategies to address overdose risk.
   Methods: Patients seeking care at a large ED in the city of Flint, Michigan participated in a computerized self-assessment during 2011-2013 (n = 4571). Overdose was assessed with a broad definition and included occurrences that could be considered adverse drug events. Among those with this type of experience, additional items assessed symptoms, outcomes, and intent.
   Results: 12% reported an overdose history. Of participants' most serious overdoses, 74% were without clear intent for self-harm, although this was true of only 61% of overdoses involving opiates or sedatives, and 52% had symptoms present that indicated that it was life-threatening. Binge drinking on a monthly basis (ORS = 1.4) was associated with a medically serious overdose compared to never having an overdose. Compared to no drug use in the last year, use of one drug was associated with an OR of 1.8, two drugs was associated with an OR of 5.8, three drugs was associated with an OR of 8.4, and four or more drugs was associated with an OR of 25.1 of having had a medically serious overdose (all p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Most overdose experiences among ED patients were without clear intent of self-harm. The ED may be an appropriate setting for efforts to reduce overdose risk, especially among polysubstance users.

ID ACUTE LIVER-FAILURE; MULTICENTER
AB Context. Deaths from overdose of acetaminophen (APAP) combination medications are reported, yet the individual ingredients are not well examined as individual putative causes of death. Objective. To examine the individual contribution of APAP or other ingredient(s) to fatalities resulting from ingestion of APAP combination products reported to poison centers. Materials and methods. A search in the United States (US) National Poison Data System between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2009 (10 years) was conducted. Only fatal cases determined by American Association of Poison Control Centers Fatality Review team to be caused by ingestion of one or more APAP combination products were included. The fatality abstract narrative for each case was obtained. Each narrative abstract was rated independently by four reviewers and putative cause of death was determined to be APAP, 'other ingredient' or 'unable to determine'. Fleiss' Kappa test was utilized to assess interrater agreement. Results. Three hundred and thirty-seven deaths met inclusion criteria: 204 were due to suicides, 96 were the result of nonmedical use, 3 were from a therapeutic error, 1 resulted from an unsupervised pediatric ingestion, and 33 were due to unknown reason for exposure. The overall putative cause of death was APAP in 60.8%, other ingredients in 29.7%, and unable to determine in 9.5% of fatalities. APAP was responsible for the fatality in 79.2% of deaths resulting from nonmedical use of APAP combination products. Fleiss Kappa was 0.74, indicating substantial interrater agreement. Discussion and conclusion. The most common putative cause of death in fatal overdoses involving APAP combination products reported to US poison centers is the APAP component.

LA English
DT Article
ID HOMELESS POPULATION; MENTAL-DISORDERS; COSTS; MEDICAID; HEALTH; DRUGS
AB Objective: This study quantifies excess annual costs associated with schizophrenia patients in the United States in 2002 from a societal perspective.
   Method: Annual direct medical costs associated with schizophrenia were estimated separately for privately (N = 1090) and publicly (Medicaid; N = 14,074) insured patients based on administrative claims data, including a large private claims database and the California Medicaid program (Medi-Cal) database, and compared separately to dernographically/geographically matched control samples (I case:3 controls). Medicare costs of patients over age 65 years were imputed using the Medicare/Medi-Cal duat-eligible patients (N = 1491) and published statistics. Excess annual direct non-health care costs were estimated for law enforcement, homeless shelters, and research/training related to schizophrenia. Excess annual indirect costs were estimated for 4 components of productivity loss: unemployment, reduced workplace productivity, premature mortality from suicide, and family caregiving using a human capital approach based on market wages. All costs were adjusted to 2002 dollars using the Medical Care Consumer Price Index and were based on the reported prevalence in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication.
   Results: The overall U.S. 2002 cost of schizophrenia was estimated to be $62.7 billion, with $22.7 billion excess direct health care cost ($7.0 billion outpatient, $5.0 billion drugs, $2.8 billion inpatient, $8.0 billion long-term care). The total direct non-health care excess costs, including living cost offsets, were estimated to be $7.6 billion. The total indirect excess costs were estimated to be $32.4 billion.
   Conclusion: Schizophrenia is a debilitating illness resulting in significant costs. The indirect excess cost due to unemployment is the largest component of overall schizophrenia excess annual costs.

AB This study was designed to investigate physicians' perceptions of changes in the United States health care system impacting academic medicine, quality of care, patient referrals, cost, ethical and sociopolitical aspects of medicine. A survey was mailed in 1998 to 1,272 physicians (graduates of Jefferson Medical College between 1987 and 1992); 835 physicians (66%) responded. Results showed that a substantial majority (92%) believed that learning to work in a managed care environment should become an essential component of medical education. Physicians perceived that current changes impair physicians' autonomy (94%), and restrain physicians' freedom to provide optimal care (84%). A sizable majority (76%) endorsed patients' freedom to seek specialist care, and 55% believed that capitation reduces physicians' motivation for long-term monitoring of patients. The majority endorsed universal health coverage (80%), and agreed to support rather than resist the changes (62%). Only 18% hold a positive view of the changes in the future. The majority believed that medical education should prepare physicians to provide end-of-life care (92%), and that organized medicine should take a stand on social issues that can influence the well-being of society (79%). Only 34% endorsed the legalization of physician-assisted suicide. No gender differences were observed, but a few differences were found between generalists and specialists. Results can help in understanding physicians' perceptions of current changes in the United States health care system, and in providing guidelines for the development of educational programs to prepare physicians to face new challenges.

AB Lithium has been marketed in the United States of America since the 1970s as a treatment for bipolar disorder. More recently, studies have shown that lithium can improve cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the current United States Food and Drug Administration-approved lithium pharmaceutics (carbonate and citrate chemical forms) have a narrow therapeutic window and unstable pharmacokinetics that, without careful monitoring, can cause serious adverse effects. Here, we investigated the safety profile, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic efficacy of LISPRO (ionic co-crystal of lithium salicylate and l-proline), lithium salicylate, and lithium carbonate (Li2CO3). We found that LISPRO (8-week oral treatment) reduces beta-amyloid plaques and phosphorylation of tau by reducing neuroinflammation and inactivating glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta in transgenic Tg2576 mice. Specifically, cytokine profiles from the brain, plasma, and splenocytes suggested that 8-week oral treatment with LISPRO downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines, upregulates anti-inflammatory cytokines, and suppresses renal cyclooxygenase 2 expression in transgenic Tg2576 mice. Pharmacokinetic studies indicated that LISPRO provides significantly higher brain lithium levels and more steady plasma lithium levels in both B6129SF2/J (2-week oral treatment) and transgenic Tg2576 (8-week oral treatment) mice compared with Li2CO3. Oral administration of LISPRO for 28 weeks significantly reduced beta-amyloid plaques and tau-phosphorylation. In addition, LISPRO significantly elevated pre-synaptic (synaptophysin) and post-synaptic protein (post synaptic density protein 95) expression in brains from transgenic 3XTg-AD mice. Taken together, our data suggest that LISPRO may be a superior form of lithium with improved safety and efficacy as a potential new disease modifying drug for AD.

AB This is an introductory article for the special issue on "Advancing Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander Health" of the Asian American Journal of Psychology. It provides a demographic and historical overview of Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders in the United States as well as the most pressing physical and mental health issues faced by these communities. In so doing, this article provides the larger cultural and social context for the studies that comprise this special issue. The eight articles in this special issue reflect the current "state of the science" in Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander health-related research across two broad domains-behavioral health and chronic medical disease disparities. Each article in this special issue is summarized with a focus on its unique contribution to advancing Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander health. In addition, the current challenges and opportunities for advancing Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander health are explored, which include a call for data disaggregation from Asian populations, moving the science from characterizing health disparities to real-world solutions, conducting culturally responsive research, and diversifying the health science workforce to include Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders.

Farmers had lower mortality than urban referents for all causes of death (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37-0.71), cancer (HR = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.24-0.78) and cardiovascular diseases (HR = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.36-0.99). Nonfarming rural men had lower mortality than urban referents for all causes of deaths (HR 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70-0.94). Farmers and nonfarming rural men had significantly lower morbidity risks of cancer and of psychiatric disorders than urban referents. Farmers had significantly lower risk of endocrine disorders, cardiovascular disorders, and respiratory, disorders. In general, morbidity was lower among arming rural men compared with urban referents and was even lower among farmers. Urban referents had, however, significantly less musculoskeletal disorder Morbidity. All urban-rural factor and a Farming occupational or lifestyle factor results in lower mortality and morbidity rates except concerning musculoskeletal disorders.

SO AESTHETIC SURGERY JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID AESTHETIC PLASTIC-SURGERY; HAIR RESTORATION SURGERY; HISTORY; LIFT
AB John H. Woodbury was an incredibly entrepreneurial, self-trained dermatologist who, between 1870 and 1909, built an empire of cosmetic surgery institutes in 6 states, with 25 physician/surgeon employees and an advertising budget of $150,000/year (1892 data). Under his management, his surgeons, and perhaps Woodbury himself, performed multiple facial cosmetic surgeries, including early versions of browlifts, frown excisions, lower facelifts, mid-face lifts, rhinoplasties, double-chin reductions, and dimple creation. In addition, Woodbury developed a proprietary soap and cosmetic line, which he sold to Jergens for $212,500 in 1901 (retaining a 10% royalty). Woodbury's story has been unknown until now because this nonacademic concentrated his publishing in articles and advertisements in lay magazines. Woodbury's life ended in bankruptcy, litigation, and suicide when the corporate practice of medicine and advertising were made illegal. In his legal proceedings, Woodbury conceded that he was not a doctor, although he went by the title. Regardless, his surgical innovations are of major historical significance, as these cosmetic procedures are the first of their kind to be noted in the lay or academic press and predate, by years and even decades, the previously earliest known cosmetic surgeries in the United States.

AB Background Differences in life expectancy at birth across social classes can be more easily interpreted as a measure of absolute inequalities in survival. This study quantified age- and cause-specific contributions to life expectancy differences by income among 4 million public servants and their dependents in South Korea (9.1% of the total Korean population).
   Methods Using 9-year mortality follow-up data (208 612 deaths) on 4 055 150 men and women aged 0-94 years, with national health insurance premiums imposed proportionally based on monthly salary as a measure of income, differences in life expectancy at birth by income were estimated by age- and cause-specific mortality differences using Arriaga's decomposition method.
   Results Life expectancy at birth gradually increased with income. Differences in life expectancy at birth between the highest and the lowest income quartile were 6.22 years in men and 1.74 years in women. Mortality differentials by income among those aged epsilon 50 years contributed most substantially (80.4% in men and 85.6% in women) to the socio-economic differences in life expectancy at birth. In men, cancers (stomach, liver and lung), cardiovascular diseases (stroke), digestive diseases (liver cirrhosis) and external causes (transport accidents and suicide) were important contributors to the life expectancy differences. In women, the contribution of ill-defined causes was most important. Cardiovascular diseases (stroke and hypertensive disease) and external causes (transport accidents and suicide) also contributed to the life expectancy differences in women while the contributions of cancers and digestive diseases were minimal.
   Conclusions Reductions in socio-economic differentials in mortality from stroke and external causes (transport accidents and suicide) among middle-aged and older men and women would significantly contribute to equalizing life expectancy among income groups. Policy efforts to reduce mortality differentials in major cancers (stomach, liver and lung) and liver cirrhosis are also important for eliminating Korean men's socio-economic inequalities in life expectancy.

TI Extreme Risk Protection Orders: An Opportunity to Improve Gun Violence
   Prevention Training
SO ACADEMIC MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID FIREARM SAFETY; UNITED-STATES; SUICIDE; PHYSICIANS; EDUCATION; INJURY;
   TRENDS; RATES
AB States are increasingly enacting extreme risk protection order (ERPO) laws, also known as "red flag" or gun violence restraining order laws, as one part of a multidisciplinary approach to address the national gun violence epidemic. Passed into law in more than 10 states and under consideration by legislatures in approximately 30 others, ERPO laws create a legal process to temporarily remove firearms from people who may pose a risk to themselves or others. By enabling family or household members, law enforcement, and, in some cases, health care professionals to petition courts when they are concerned about a potential crisis, these laws can potentially prevent firearm-related violence and save lives. Most states with ERPO laws do not give health care professionals a direct role in filing petitions; still, physicians may serve as a resource for patients or their families by counseling on firearm safety and raising awareness of this legal pathway. In this way, the success of ERPO laws depends, in part, on the ability of physicians to accurately assess risk. However, physicians are often not proficient in making these types of risk assessments, largely because of insufficient training, particularly in the context of firearm-related violence. The authors review the literature on physician skill in violence-related risk assessment, medical education in gun violence prevention, and the capacity for training to improve such risk assessments. The authors then make recommendations for integrating focused gun violence prevention training into undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medical education, reviewing notable examples.

AB Background: There has been no previous household population study of suicidal ideation and attempts in Kenya. Therefore this study aimed to establish the prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts in a rural population in Kenya, and to assess risk factors.
   Methods: An epidemiological survey of a household population, using standardised structured interviews. We examined the prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts and the predictors of suicidal thoughts and attempts, using STATA to calculate unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios.
   Results: A quarter of the sample (24.1 %) had thought that life was not worth living (tedium vitae) at some point in their lives, while a fifth had experienced death wishes at some stage. About 7.9 % reported suicidal thoughts and 1.9 % had made actual suicide attempts at some point in their lives. It can be seen that the prevalence of suicidal thoughts was 0.7 %, 4.2 %, 3.7 % and 7.9 % for last week, last year, at some other time, and lifetime respectively, while the prevalence of suicidal attempts was 0.5 %, 1.2 %, 0.7 and 1.9 % respectively.
   In the adjusted analysis of factors associated with suicidal thoughts, being female (OR 1.8, p = 0.017), having CMD (OR 2.7, p = 0.001), having a number of recent life events (OR 2.3, p = 0.001 for 2-3 life events and OR 2.6, p = 0.004 for 4 or more life events), and having a large social group size (OR 7.7, p = 0.006 for social group size of 4-8 and OR 9.1, p = 0.003 for social group size of 9 or more) were all associated with increased rates of life time suicidal thoughts, but psychotic symptoms were no longer significant after adjustment for the other variables. In the adjusted analysis of suicide attempts, having any psychotic symptoms (OR 5.1, p = 0.001) was the only factor associated with suicide attempts after adjustment for other factors significant at the bivariate level.
   Conclusion: Suicidal ideation and attempts pose a significant public health burden in this poor rural area of Kenya. The findings are relevant for mental health promotion and prevention programmes, public education and professional training programmes in relevant sectors, especially in front line health workers and social workers.

AB Background:Over the past decade, overdoses involving opioids and benzodiazepines have risen at alarming rates, making reductions in coprescribing of these medications a priority, particularly among patients who may be susceptible to adverse events due to high-risk conditions.Objectives:This quality improvement project evaluated the effectiveness of a medication alert designed to reduce opioid and benzodiazepine coprescribing among Veterans with known high-risk conditions (substance use, sleep apnea, suicide-risk, age 65 and above) at 1 Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system.Methods:Prescribers were exposed to the point-of-prescribing alert for 12 months. For each high-risk cohort we used interrupted time series design to examine population trends in coprescribing 12 months after alert launch adjusting for coprescribing 12 months before launch, demographics and clinical covariates. Trends at the alert site were compared with those of a similar VA health care system without the alert. Secondary analyses examined population trends in opioid and benzodiazepine prescribing separately.Results:Over 12 months, the alert activated for 1332 patients. Proportions of patients with concurrent prescriptions decreased significantly postalert launch among substance use [adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.96-0.99; 12-month decrease=25.0%], sleep apnea (AOR=0.97, 95% CI=0.95-0.98, 12-month decrease=38.5%), and suicide-risk (AOR=0.94, 95% CI=0.91-0.98, 12-month decrease=61.5%) cohorts at the alert site. Decreases in coprescribing were significantly different from the comparison site among suicide-risk (AOR=0.92, 95% CI=0.86-0.97) and sleep apnea (AOR=0.98, 95% CI=0.96-1.00) cohorts. Significant decreases in benzodiazepine prescribing trends were observed at the alert site only.Conclusions:Medication alerts hold promise as a means of reducing opioid and benzodiazepine coprescribing among certain high-risk groups.

AB Background: Past research suggests self-harm/suicidality are more common among adults who have undergone bariatric surgery than the general population.
   Objectives: To compare prevalence of self-harm/suicidal ideation over time and identify presurgery risk factors for postsurgery self-harm/suicidal ideation.
   Setting: The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 is a cohort study with presurgery and annual postsurgery assessments conducted at 10 U.S. hospitals.
   Methods: Adults with severe obesity undergoing bariatric surgery between March 2006 and April 2009 (n=2458). Five-year follow-up is reported. Self-reported history of suicidality assessed retrospectively via the Suicide Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R) and self-reported self-harm/suicidal ideation assessed prospectively via the Beck Depression Inventory-Version 1 (BDI-1).
   Results: The SBQ-R was completed by 1540 participants; 2217 completed the BDI-1 pre- and postsurgery. Over 75% of participants were female, with a median age of 46 years and body mass index of 45.9 kg/m2. Approximately one fourth of participants (395/1534) reported a presurgery history of suicidal thoughts or behavior (SBQ-R). The prevalence of self-harm/suicidal ideation (BDI-1) was 5.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.7-6.8) presurgery and 3.8% (95% CI, 2.5-5.1) at year 1 postsurgery (P=.06). Prevalence increased over time postsurgery to 6.6% (95% CI, 4.6-8.6) at year 5 (P =.001) but was not significantly different than presurgery (P = .12).
   Conclusions: A large cohort of adults with severe obesity who underwent bariatric surgery had a prevalence of self-harm/suicidal ideation that may have decreased in the first postoperative year but increased over time to presurgery levels, suggesting screening for self-harm/suicidality is warranted throughout long-term postoperative care. Several risk factors were identified that may help with enhanced monitoring. (C) 2018 American Society for Bariatric Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: Patients' desire for hastened death within the context of advanced disease and palliative care is a controversial topic, frequently discussed in the international literature. Much of the discussion has focused on opinion and debate about ethical matters related to hastened death. Not many research studies seem to have specifically targeted why palliative care patients may desire hastened death, and few have focused on clinical guidelines for responding to such requests. Methods: Using a systematic literature review process, we evaluated the research evidence related to the reasons patients express a desire for a hastened death, and the quality of clinical guidelines in this area. Results: Thirty-five research studies met the inclusion criteria related to reasons associated with a desire for hastened death. The factors associated with a desire to die were often complex and multifactorial; however, psychological, existential and social reasons seem to be more prominent than those directly related to physical symptoms, such as pain. Much of the evidence supporting the reasons for these statements is based on: (a) patients' perceptions of how they may feel in the future, and (b) health professionals' and families' interpretations of why desire to die statements may have been made. Several publications provided expert opinion for responding to requests for physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia. In keeping with this limited research base, there is a lack of evidence-based guidelines for clinical care that addresses the desire to die among terminally ill patients. Most literature has focused on discipline specific responses, with minimal exploration of how clinicians might respond initially to a statement from a patient regarding a desire to die. Conclusions: In order to advance understanding of the complex issue of desire for hastened death in the context of palliative care, research should focus on studies with patients who have actually made a desire to die statement and the development of guidelines to help health professionals respond. Direction for research in this area is described.

AB Objectives: To investigate the views and experiences of British pharmacists in physician-assisted suicide ( PAS) and voluntary active euthanasia (VAE) and to examine whether differences in views were associated with personal characteristics.
   Method: A postal questionnaire was mailed to a random sample of 500 registered pharmacists, with addresses in England or Wales, stratified according to sex and community/hospital working environments.
   Main outcome measure: Pharmacists' reports of their views and experiences of PAS and VAE.
   Results: Completed questionnaires were received from 295 respondents (response rate: 59%). The majority of respondents (83%) reported that at times, a person had the right to choose their own manner of death; 61% and 53% thought that there should be changes in the Law to legalise VAE and PAS, respectively. If it were legal to do so, 63% stated that they would be willing to dispense medication for VAE and 64% for PAS. However, only 45% agreed that the pharmacist should have a role in advising the prescriber on the choice and dose of drugs used. Sex, age, and years registered as a pharmacist were not found to be significantly associated with views on the practices of PAS and VAE. However, pharmacists who reported having a religion were significantly less likely to favour such practices. On comparing the views of community and hospital pharmacists, community pharmacists were significantly less likely than expected to want to be informed about the intended purpose of lethal drugs.
   Conclusion: In this survey, while over half of British pharmacists did not disagree in principle to the legalisation of VAE and/or PAS, they were less supportive of direct involvement in such procedures. Religion was a discriminatory factor associated with negative views of VAE and PAS. The significant minority of pharmacists not wanting to know the purpose of drugs they suspected might be for PAS or VAE is not in accordance with professional accountability, reflecting the complex and sometimes conflicting legal and moral aspects of such practices when deciding upon a course of action.

AB Context: Polypharmacy is widely used in the treatment of schizophrenia, although it is believed to have major adverse effects on the well-being of patients.
   Objective: To investigate if the use of benzodiazepines, antidepressants, or multiple concomitant antipsychotics is associated with increased mortality among patients with schizophrenia.
   Design: Registry-based case linkage study.
   Setting: Academic research.
   Patients: We linked national databases of mortality and medication prescriptions among a complete nationwide cohort of 2588 patients hospitalized in Finland for the first time with a diagnosis of schizophrenia between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2007.
   Main Outcome Measures: Hazard ratios (HRs) were computed for all-cause mortality during the use of antipsychotics, antidepressants, or benzodiazepines in outpatient care, adjusting for the effects of sociodemographic and clinical variables, geographic location, and current and past pharmacological treatments.
   Results: Compared with antipsychotic monotherapy, concomitant use of 2 or more antipsychotics was not associated with increased mortality (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.51-1.44). Similarly, antidepressant use was not associated with a higher risk for mortality (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.28-1.16) and was associated with markedly decreased suicide deaths (HR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.03-0.77). However, benzodiazepine use was associated with a substantial increase in mortality (HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.13-3.22), and this was attributable to suicidal deaths (HR, 3.83; 95% CI, 1.45-10.12) and to nonsuicidal deaths (HR, 1.60; 95% CI, 0.86-2.97). In total, 826 of 904 patients (91.4%) who used benzodiazepines had purchased prescriptions that contained more than 28 defined daily doses, violating treatment guidelines.
   Conclusions: Benzodiazepine use was associated with a marked increase in mortality among patients with schizophrenia, whereas the use of an antidepressant or several concomitant antipsychotics was not. Antidepressant use was associated with decreased suicide deaths. The literature indicates that long-term use of benzodiazepines among patients with schizophrenia is more prevalent in other countries (eg, the United States) compared with Finland, which suggests that benzodiazepine use may contribute to mortality among this patient population worldwide.

AB Background. We examined the relationship of the number of adverse childhood experiences (ACE score) to six health problems among four successive birth cohorts dating back to 1900 to assess the strength and consistency of these relationships in face of secular influences the 20th century brought in changing health behaviors and conditions. We hypothesized that the ACE score/health problem relationship would be relatively "immune" to secular influences, in support of recent studies documenting the negative neurobiologic effects of childhood stressors on the developing brain.
   Methods. A retrospective cohort study of 17,337 adult health maintenance organization (HMO) members who completed a survey about childhood abuse and household dysfunction, as well as their health. We used logistic regression to examine the relationships between ACE score and six health problems (depressed affect, suicide attempts, multiple sexual partners, sexually transmitted diseases, smoking, and alcoholism) across four successive birth cohorts: 1900-1931, 1932-1946, 1947-1961, and 1962-1978.
   Results. The ACE score increased the risk for each health problem in a consistent, strong, and graded manner across four birth cohorts (P < 0.05). For each unit increase in the ACE score (range: 0-8), the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for depressed affect, STDs, and multiple sexual partners were increased within a narrow range (ORs: 1.2-1.3 per unit increase) for each of the birth cohorts; the increase in risk for suicide attempts was stronger but also in a narrow range (ORs: 1.5-1.7).
   Conclusions. Growing up with ACEs increased the risk of numerous health behaviors and outcomes for 20th century birth cohorts, suggesting that the effects of ACEs on the risk of various health problems are unaffected by social or secular changes. Research showing detrimental and lasting neurobiologic effects of child abuse on the developing brain provides a plausible explanation for the consistency and dose-response relationships found for each health problem across birth cohorts, despite changing secular influences.

AB Background: The objectives of this study were to determine whether short-term exposure to firearm safety messaging significantly improved (1) firearm storage practices, and (2) attitudes of safe firearm storage behaviors among U.S. veterans, a group at elevated risk for firearm suicide.
   Design: A three-arm, parallel-group RCT was conducted online in the U.S. nationwide from December 2015 to January 2016.
   Setting: A national random sample of U.S. veterans (N = 358) was recruited from the GfK KnowledgePanel, a probability-based internet panel representative of U.S. adults. All study activities were administered online over a three-week study period.
   Intervention: Participants were randomized and exposed three times (once per week) to either (a) firearm safety message only (n = 115); (b) firearm safety and mental health promotion messages (n = 133); or (c) active control group exposed to mental health promotion message only (n = 110). Each message was less than two minutes long.
   Measures: Assessments were completed at baseline (pre-randomization) and at end-of-trial. Changes in awareness of risk for injuries, attitudes/beliefs related to safe storage practices, behavioral intentions, and storage practices were measured using self-reported surveys. Linear mixed effect models with weighted generalized estimating equations were used to test for exposure effects. Analyses were conducted February 2018.
   Results: Analyses restricted to those with baseline firearm access (n = 195) identified no significant changes for intentions or safe storage practices across exposure groups. At baseline, participants' attitudes and beliefs were generally supportive of safe firearm storage. The Firearm Safety message yielded small increases in agreement with the concept that secure storage is "important during emotional or stressful times" (0.36; 95% CI = 0.08, 0.64). Other significant changes in awareness and beliefs were found, but across all study conditions.
   Conclusion: Results reinforce the critical need for considerable research and testing prior to the widespread implementation of public messages to increase the likelihood for desired exposure effects.

AB Background: Recent studies have associated sport-related concussion with depression and impaired cognitive ability later in life in former professional football players. However, population studies with two 1950s-era cohorts did not find an association between high school football participation and impaired cognition or depressive symptoms in late adulthood. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study assessed whether actual/intended participation in contact sports during adolescence had an adverse effect on participants' cognition or depressive symptoms in early adulthood. We hypothesized that there would not be an association. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: This study used a subsample (n = 10,951) from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), a nationally (United States) representative prospective cohort study following participants through 4 waves of data collection from 1994 through 2008. Participants were categorized as actual/intended participation in no sports, noncontact sports only, and contact sports. We constructed 6 multivariate and logistic regression models predicting word recall, number recall, modified Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, depression diagnosis, suicide ideation, and suicide attempts at wave IV as a function of sport participation during wave I. Sport participation was treated as a factor with the referent category noncontact sports. This analysis was repeated on a males-only sample (n = 5008). In the males-only analysis, participants were classified as actual/intended participation in no sports, noncontact sports, contact sports other than American football, and American football. The referent category remained noncontact sports. Results: Intention to participate in contact sports was not significantly associated with any of the outcomes in the full-sample analysis. Intention to participate in football was significantly associated with a reduced odds of depression diagnosis in adulthood (odds ratio, 0.70; P = .02) when compared with noncontact sports participation in the males-only sample. Football was not significantly associated with impaired cognitive ability, increased depressive symptoms, or increased suicide ideation. Conclusion: Actual/intended participation in contact sports during adolescence did not adversely affect Add Health participants' cognition or depressive symptoms in young adulthood.

AB Background: Gun violence is a controversial public health issue plagued by a lack of recent research. We sought to provide a 13-y overview of firearm hospitalizations in Pennsylvania, analyzing trends in mode, intent, and outcome. We hypothesized that no adjusted change in mortality or functional status at discharge (FSD) would be observed for gunshot wound (GSW) victims over the study period.
   Methods: All admissions to the Pennsylvania Trauma Outcome Study database from 2003 to 2015 were queried. GSWs were identified by external cause-of-injury codes. Collected variables included patient demographics, firearm type, intent (assault and attempted suicide), FSD, and mortality. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression models and ordinal regression analyses using generalized linearmixedmodels assessed the impact of admission year (continuous) on adjusted mortality and FSD score, respectively. Significance was set at P < 0.05.
   Results: Of the 462,081 patients presenting to Pennsylvania trauma centers from 2003 to 2015, 19,342 were GSWs (4.2%). Handguns were the most common weapon of injury (n = 7007; 86.7%) among cases with specified firearm type. Most GSWs were coded as assaults (n = 15,415; 79.7%), with suicide attempts accounting 1866 hospitalizations (9.2%). Suicide attempts were most prevalent among young and middle-aged white males, whereas assaults were more common in young black males. Rates of firearm hospitalizations decreased over time (test of trend P = 0.001); however, admission year was not associated with improved adjusted survival (adjusted odds ratio: 0.99, 95% confidence interval: 0.97-1.01; P = 0.353) or FSD (adjusted odds ratio: 0.99, 95% confidence interval: 0.98-1.00; P = 0.089) while controlling for demographic and injury severity covariates.
   Conclusions: Temporal trends in outcomes suggest rates of firearm hospitalizations are declining in Pennsylvania; however, outcomes remain unchanged. To combat this epidemic, a multidisciplinary, demographic-specific approach to prevention should be the focus of future scientific pursuits. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Adolescent depression has become epidemic in the United States, with statistics showing that one in five adolescents may suffer from depression (Brent and Birmaher in N Engl J Med 347(9), 2002). This article examines adolescent depression from a psychodynamic perspective, and identifies the psychodynamics of adolescent depression as the affective correlates that stem from unresolved developmental conflicts, issues of separation/individuation, the search for identity and the development of the true self. This article presents wilderness therapy as a holistic intervention which can be used to address the intrapsychic, developmental and relational factors that give rise to adolescent depression. Wilderness therapy is a modality of mental health treatment that takes place outdoors and utilizes challenge and adventure, group work and other structured clinical interventions. A clinical case study presents wilderness therapy as an effective intervention for adolescent depression that can promote positive self-image and enhanced coping skills, and discusses limitations and implications for social work practice.

AB Shiga toxin producing E. coli (STEC) is an important group of foodborne pathogens in the United States and worldwide. Nearly half of STEC-induced diarrheal disease in the United States is caused by serotype O157:H7, while non-O157 STEC account for the remaining illnesses. Thus, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service has instituted regulatory testing of beef products and has a zero-tolerance policy for regulatory samples that test positive for STEC O157:H7 and six other non-O157 STEC (serogroups O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, and O145). In this study, positive control (PC) strains for the detection of STEC O157:H7 and the six USDA-regulated non-O157 STEC were constructed. To ensure that the food testing samples are not cross-contaminated by the PC sample, it is important that the STEC-PC strains are distinguishable from STEC isolated from test samples. The PC strains were constructed by integrating a unique DNA target sequence and a gene for spectinomycin (Sp) resistance into the chromosomes of the seven STEC strains. End-point and real-time PCR assays were developed for the specific detection of the PC strains and were tested using 93 strains of E. coli (38 STEC O157:H7, at least 6 strains of each of the USDA-regulated non-O157 STEC, and 2 commensal E. coli) and 51 strains of other bacteria (30 species from 20 genera). The PCR assays demonstrated high specificity for the unique target sequence. The target sequence was detectable by PCR after 10 culture passages (similar to 100 generations), demonstrating the stability of the integrated target sequence. In addition, the strains were tested for their potential use in modeling the growth of STEC. Plating the PC strains mixed with ground beef flora on modified rainbow agar containing Sp eliminated the growth of the background flora that grew on modified rainbow agar without Sp. Thus, these strains could be used to enumerate and model the growth of STEC in the presence of foodborne background flora.

AB The birth rate in 2000 (preliminary data) was 14.8 births per 1000 population, an increase of 2% from 1999 (14.5). The fertility rate, births per 1000 women aged 15 to 44 years, increased 3% to 67.6 in 2000, compared with 65.9 in 1999. The 2000 increases in births and the fertility rate were the third consecutive yearly increases, the largest in many years, halting the steady decline in the number of births and fertility rates in the 1990s.
   Fertility rates for total white, non-Hispanic white, black, and Native American women each increased about 2% in 2000. The fertility rate for black women, which declined 19% from 1990 to 1996, has changed little since 1996. The rate for Hispanic women rose 4% in 2000 to reach the highest level since 1993. Birth rates for women 30 years or older continued to increase. The proportion of births to unmarried women remained about the same at one third, but the number of births rose 3%.
   The birth rate for teen mothers declined again for the ninth consecutive year. The use of timely prenatal care (83.2%) remained unchanged in 2000, and was essentially unchanged for non-Hispanic white (88.5%), black (74.2%), and Hispanic (74.4%) mothers.
   The number and rate of multiple births continued their dramatic rise, but all of the increase was confined to twins; for the first time in more than a decade, the number of triplet and higher-order multiple births declined (4%) between 1998 and 1999 (multiple birth information is not available in preliminary 2000 data). The overall increases in multiple births account, in part, for the lack of improvement in the percentage of low birth weight (LBW) births. LBW remained at 7.6% in 2000.
   The infant mortality rate (IMR) dropped to 6.9 per 1000 live births (preliminary data) in 2000 (the rate was 7.1 in 1999). The ratio of the IMR among black infants to that for white infants was 2.5 in 2000, the same as in 1999. Racial differences in infant mortality remain a major public health concern. The role of low birth weight in infant mortality remains a major issue. Among all of the states, Utah and Maine had the lowest IMRs. State-by-state differences in IMR reflect racial composition, the percentage LBW, and birth weight-specific neonatal mortality rates for each state. The United States continues to rank poorly in international comparisons of infant mortality.
   Expectation of life at birth reached a record high of 76.9 years for all gender and race groups combined. Death rates in the United States continue to decline. The age-adjusted death rate for suicide declined 4% between 1999 and 2000; homicide declined 7%. Death rates for children 19 years of age or less declined for 3 of the 5 leading causes in 2000; cancer and suicide levels did not change for children as a group. A large proportion of childhood deaths, however, continue to occur as a result of preventable injuries.

AB IMPORTANCE: Increased understanding of public response to mass shootings could guide public health planning regarding firearms.
   OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that mass shootings are associated with gun purchasing in the United States and to determine factors associated with gun purchasing changes.
   DESIGN AND SETTING: In a cross-sectional study, monthly data on US background checks for all firearm purchases, handgun permits, and long gun permits between November 1, 1998, and April 30, 2016, were obtained from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. All mass shootings resulting in 5 or more individuals injured or killed during the study period were also identified. Interrupted autoregressive integrated moving average time-series modeling was used to identify events associated with changes in gun purchase volume. Then, logistic regression was used to identify event characteristics associated with changes in gun purchases. Analyses were performed between June 6, 2016, and February 5, 2019.
   EXPOSURES: For the time-series analysis, each mass shooting was modeled as an exposure. In the logistic regression, examined factors were the shooter's race/ethnicity, the region in the United States in which a shooting occurred, whether a shooting was school related, fatalities, handgun use, long gun use, automatic or semiautomatic gun use, media coverage level, and state political affiliation.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Identification of major mass shootings significantly associated with changes in gun purchases, and the identification of event-specific factors associated with changes in gun purchases.
   RESULTS: Between November 1998 and April 2016, 124 major mass shootings and 233 996 385 total background checks occurred. A total of 26 shootings (21.0%) were associated with increases in gun purchases and 22 shootings (17.7%) were associated with decreases in gun purchasing. Shootings receiving extensive media coverage were associated with handgun purchase increases (odds ratio, 5.28; 95% CI, 1.30-21.41; P = .02). Higher-fatality shootings had an inverse association with handgun purchase decreases (odds ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.53-1.00; P = .049).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this study suggest an association between mass shootings and changes in gun purchases, observed on a comprehensive timescale. Identification of media coverage and fatalities as significant factors underlying this association invites further study into the mechanisms driving gun purchase changes, holding implications for public health response to future gun violence.

AB Aims: This study explored the relationship between social support, community connections, self-esteem, and culture on misuse in American Indian youth. Methods: The study team developed a culturally-responsive 16-question survey for American Indian youth ages 12-20 living in six American Indian communities in the Great Plains Region of the United States. The study was grounded in primary socialization theory and variables were explored using regression models. Results: A total of 565 American Indian youth completed the participant survey between January 2016 and August 2017. The present study found that community connections were negatively associated with marijuana use in American Indian youth. Higher community connection scores were associated with higher social support and self-esteem scores. Conclusions: Tribally-led prevention initiatives can fill an important socio-behavioral prevention gap by facilitating social support opportunities for American Indian youth who may not have adequate support from immediate family or friends.

AB Despite the unequivocal incidence and burden that mental illnesses place on the world, those with mental illness remain not only neglected but also deeply stigmatized across societies. The stigma that surrounds mental illness serves as a barrier to treatment and recovery, leading to serious negative consequences such as school failure, job loss, and suicide. Whilemany large-scale socialmarketing efforts have found some success in reducing stigma, we contend that the recommended approaches, which utilize the input of people with mental illness and those close to them, are inadequate and that a deeper understanding of those who stigmatize is needed. This research first provides a comprehensive examination of the components that comprise stigmaand then uses these components to segment the general population. The authors then present recommendations based on differences in the endorsement of stigma among these segments to inform policy and advocacy groups in developing more varied and potentially more effective social marketing campaigns.

AB This study examined the distribution of substance use, mental health, and criminal behavior among dropouts derived from a nationally representative sample of 18-25 year old (N = 19,312) emerging adults in the United States. Using public-use data from the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, this study employed multiple logistic regression with adjustments for complex survey sampling and compared high school dropouts with graduates with respect to substance use, mental health, and criminal behavior. After controlling for the effects of age, gender, race/ethnicity, family income, receipt of government assistance, employment status, and metropolitan population density, dropouts were more likely to meet criteria for nicotine dependence and report daily cigarette use, and more likely to report having attempted suicide in the previous year, been arrested for larceny, assault, drug possession or drug sales relative to their high school graduate counterparts. The findings of this study provide important insights and an initial epidemiologic portrait of mental health, substance use, and criminal behaviors of dropouts during emerging adulthood.

ID DEPRESSION
AB Most elderly persons in the United States with mental health problems such as depression receive no attention or care. Those who receive treatment generally do so in primary care settings, where disorders like depression have a hard time competing with other common and chronic medical problems. Typically, mental illnesses are under-recognized and under-treated in elderly persons attending primary care clinics. The experience of the PROSPECT (Prevention of Suicide in Primary Care Elderly: Collaborative Trial) study is briefly described, indicating that depression, for example, can be treated successfully in primary care elderly using the type of multidisciplinary collaborative care model advocated by Speer and Schneider (2003; this issue). The challenge now facing all of us is to create a consumer- and family-driven demand for good mental health services in geriatric clinics and a political consensus to reimburse such services fairly. Recent improvement in Medicare reimbursement for mental health services to victims of Alzheimer's dementia provides a basis for hope.

AB PurposeThis study expands upon existing research on the psychological impact of administrative segregation on inmates by addressing several methodological limitations in this body of literature.
   MethodsUsing a pre-post design, this study compared male general population (GP) inmates in the United States to those with up to 4years in segregated placement across scores on the MCMI-III.
   ResultsWhile segregated inmates reported higher levels of distress (particularly on measures of anxiety, depressed mood, post-traumatic stress, and somatic complaints) compared to the GP at post-assessment, scores did not reach the clinical cut-off. Further, inmates generally did not deteriorate as time in restrictive housing increased.
   ConclusionsThus, compared to the GP, who showed some improvement in functioning, segregated inmates remained largely the same. Rather than causing significant psychological damage, it is more likely that segregation is a barrier to opportunities for continued growth. Study limitations and recommendations for reforms in the use of segregation are presented.

AB Objective: Recent studies showed that reducing the minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) could cause negative health outcomes among youth. This evidence was drawn primarily from a limited set of geographical regions. This study seeks to widen available evidence by using data from Japan, where the government started considering reducing the MLDA from 20 to 18. Method: Using a regression discontinuity design, we compared emergency service event rates related to alcohol intoxication and mortality rates through external causes between those who were slightly younger and older than the age of 20. Results: We showed that granting legal access to alcohol at age 20 doubled the use of emergency services used for alcohol intoxication but had little impact on mortality as measured by traffic fatalities, suicide, and other accidents. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that lowering the MLDA in Japan will increase (potentially reckless and excessive) drinking behavior among young adults ages 18 and 19 but will not increase their mortality from accidents.

AB Schools across the United States have taken up the task of 'protecting' lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) youth, but their reliance on identity-based antidiscrimination policies may reinscribe power inequities. While previous scholarship critiques and cautions against such protectionist approaches, this paper explores why such policies persist. We argue that research and advocacy efforts persist in upholding protectionist frameworks because of three key investments that are inadequate for addressing power: (1) universalizing the individual, (2) prioritizing individual over structural change, and (3) addressing inequities through punishment and surveillance. We draw on a Foucauldian analysis of power, and biopower specifically, to explore how these policies do little to alter the underlying norms that impact the ways young people experience school. To exemplify our claims, we analyze the Safe School Improvement Act of 2015. As an alternative to these policies that privilege youth who most closely approximate normative standards, we push for intersectional reforms that target underlying racist and heterosexist norms.

ID UNITED-STATES; PREVALENCE; BEHAVIOR
AB Objective: The authors documented the prevalence of gambling and correlates to health among undergraduates. Methods: The authors analyzed data from a health-habit questionnaire (gambling questions included) given to students enrolled in a university-required course. Results: Gambling and problems with gambling were more frequent among men than women regardless of venue. Athletes more frequently bet on sports and played games of chance, had gambling debt, and sought help for gambling than did nonathletes. More than 50% of fraternity members gambled and had a higher prevalence of gambling debt than did other men. Several gambling practices were correlated with failure to use seatbelts, driving or riding with someone under the influence, and using drugs (including cigarettes). Twice as many students who had gambling problems reported considering or attempting suicide than did those who did not report gambling problems, and gambling was correlated with depression. Conclusion: These results indicate that gambling is correlated with high-risk health behaviors and indicates the need for intervention for college students with gambling problems.

AB This study evaluated the effect of childhood trauma exposure and the role of resilience on both depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. The study evaluated 1,488 military personnel and veterans, who served after September 2001, for depressive, suicidal, and PTSD symptoms, combat exposure, childhood trauma exposure, and resiliency. Participants were enrolled as part of an ongoing multicenter study. Outcome measures were depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. After controlling for the effects of combat exposure and PTSD, results revealed that childhood trauma exposures were significantly associated with depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. In addition, resilience was negatively associated with depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation, suggesting a potential protective effect. These findings suggest that evaluation of childhood trauma is important in the clinical assessment and treatment of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation among military personnel and veterans.

AB Context: Health disparities have been found when comparing rural and urban populations. Purpose: To compare characteristics of rural and urban cadaveric transplant donors and recipients. Methods: We used deidentified individual-level data on 55,929 cadaveric transplant donor-recipient exchanges between 2000 and 2003 and examined the relative rates of donating and receiving cadaveric transplants for rural compared to urban residents, as defined by ZIP Codes. Findings: When compared to their urban counterparts, rural organ donors were more likely to have died from head trauma, drowning, motor vehicle accidents, or suicide and less likely to have died from cerebrovascular events, cardiac events, or homicide (P < .001 for all). Rural transplant recipients had lower levels of educational attainment and were less likely to have had the transplant financed by private insurance (P < .001 for all). While we found no statistical difference in days wait to organ transplantation, rural residents were more likely to donate than to receive cadaveric organs (P < .001). Conclusions: The differences in organ donation that we found warrant further exploration.

AB OBJECTIVE Pediatric firearm injury is a leading cause of death and disability in the youth of the United States. The epidemiology of and outcomes following gunshot wounds to the head (GSWHs) are in need of systematic characterization. Here, the authors analyzed pediatric GSWHs from a population-based sample to identify predictors of prolonged hospitalization, morbidity, and death.
   METHODS All patients younger than 18 years of age and diagnosed with a GSWH in the National Sample Program (NSP) of the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) in 2003-2012 were eligible for inclusion in this study. Variables of interest included injury intent, firearm type, site of incident, age, sex, race, health insurance, geographic region, trauma center level, isolated traumatic brain injury (TBI), hypotension in the emergency department, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, and Injury Severity Score (ISS). Risk predictors for a prolonged hospital stay, morbidity, and mortality were identified. Odds ratios, mean increases or decreases (B), and 95% confidence intervals were reported. Statistical significance was assessed at alpha < 0.001 accounting for multiple comparisons.
   RESULTS In a weighted sample of 2847 pediatric patients with GSWHs, the mean age was 14.8 +/- 3.3 years, 79.2% were male, and 59.0% had severe TBI (GCS score 3-8). The mechanism of assault (63.0%), the handgun as firearm (45.6%), and an injury incurred in a residential area (40.6%) were most common. The mean hospital length of stay was 11.6 +/- 14.4 days for the survivors, for whom suicide injuries involved longer hospitalizations (B = 5.9-day increase, 95% CI 3.3-8.6, p < 0.001) relative to those for accidental injuries. Mortality was 45.1% overall but was greater with injury due to suicidal intent (mortality 71.5%, p < 0.001) or caused by a shotgun (mortality 56.5%, p < 0.001). Lower GCS scores, higher ISSs, and emergency room hypotension predicted poorer outcomes. Patients with private insurance had lower mortality odds than those with Medicare/Medicaid (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.7-3.4, p < 0.001) or government insurance (OR 3.6, 95% CI 2.2-5.8, p < 0.001). Management at level II centers, compared to level I, was associated with lower odds of returning home (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.5, p < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS From 2003 to 2012, with regard to pediatric TBI hospitalizations due to GSWHs, their proportion remained stable, those caused by accidental injuries decreased, and those attributable to suicide increased. Overall mortality was 45%. Hypotension, cranial and overall injury severity, and suicidal intent were associated with poor prognoses. Patients treated at level II trauma centers had lower odds of being discharged home. Given the spectrum of risk factors that predispose children to GSWHs, emphasis on screening, parental education, and standardization of critical care management is needed to improve outcomes.

AB Phenomenological and cultural understandings of recovery from the perspective of individuals who engage in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) are rare. The primary study objective was to understand similarities across three samples in (a) how young people define recovery from NSSI and (b) what they consider helpful approaches taken by parents and professionals to assist their recovery. Using a cross-national sample of young people (n = 98) from Australia (n = 48), Belgium (n = 25) and the United States (n = 25), we assessed their perspectives on NSSI. Consistent across all samples, young people defined recovery as no longer having the urge to self-injure when distressed, often displayed ambivalence about recovery, and reported it was helpful when parents and professionals were calm and understanding. Acceptance of recovery as a process involving relapses may need to be emphasized in NSSI treatment, to ease the pressure young people often place on themselves to stop the behavior outright.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine whether a Latina adolescent's perception of mother connectedness, father connectedness, parental caring, autonomy granting from parents, and parental interest in their child's school life predicts suicidal ideation above and beyond known risk factors of adolescent depression and acculturation. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) Wave 1, 2 secondary logistic regression data analyses were conducted on a sample of 345 Latina adolescents. Results of correlational analyses indicated that perceived mother connectedness, father connectedness, parental caring, and academic interest were positively related; depression and nativity were negatively related to reports of suicidal ideation. Additionally, in a model with adolescents who reported having both a mother and father figure present in their life, depression and academic interest were significant predictors of suicidal ideation. In a second model, which included all Latinas regardless of the presence of both parents, depression, nativity, perceived academic interest, and caring were significant predictors. Implications are discussed for suicide prevention and intervention with Latina adolescents.

AB Epidemiological data are reviewed on the prevalence, course, socio-demographic correlates, and societal costs of major depression throughout the world. Major depression is estimated in these surveys to be a commonly occurring disorder. Although estimates of lifetime prevalence and course vary substantially across countries for reasons that could involve both substantive and methodological processes, the cross-national data are clear in documenting meaningful lifetime prevalence with wide variation in age-of-onset and high risk of lifelong chronic-recurrent persistence. A number of sociodemographic correlates of major depression are found consistently across countries, and cross-national data also document associations with numerous adverse outcomes, including difficulties in role transitions ( e. g., low education, high teen childbearing, marital disruption, unstable employment), reduced role functioning ( e. g., low marital quality, low work performance, low earnings), elevated risk of onset, persistence and severity of a wide range of secondary disorders, and increased risk of early mortality due to physical disorders and suicide.

AB The association between loneliness and suicidality has been documented in many studies, but these studies have been limited by cross-sectional designs and the use of adult-only populations. The purpose of the current study was to overcome these limitations by (a) investigating whether the link between loneliness and suicidal thoughts and behaviors occurs cross-sectionally, longitudinally, or both and (b) investigating how the link between loneliness and suicidality might be influenced by different demographic variables, including gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Logistic regression analyses were used to analyze data from a large sample (N = 937) of youth from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care. Results indicated that loneliness at age 15 years was concurrently associated with both suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior at age 15 years. Loneliness in middle childhood was longitudinally associated with suicidal behaviors at age 15 years, but not with suicidal ideation at age 15 years. None of the demographic characteristics influenced these associations.

SO NUMEN-INTERNATIONAL REVIEW FOR THE HISTORY OF RELIGIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB The document found with three of the four cells responsible for the crimes of 9/11 is unique in providing specific information about how the Muslim suicide terrorists conceived of their action. The document shows that they found justification for violence by emulating the moment in early Islamic history when Muhammad cancelled contracts with non-Muslims and organized raids (ghazwa) against the Meccans in order to establish Islam as a political order. No statement in the Manual explicitly identifies the United States as the financial, military, and political center of today's paganism; rather, such identification is tacitly assumed, as was shown by the action itself. Instead, the Manual prescribes recitations, prayers and rituals by which each member of the four cells should prepare for the ghazwa, purify his intention and anticipate in his mind the successive stages of the struggle to come. Not the objective aim but the subjective intention is at the center of the Manual. The article places this type of justification of violence in the history of Islamic activism since the 1980s.

AB Previous research has established conscientiousness as a predictor of longevity (H. S. Friedman et al., 1993; L. R. Martin & H. S. Friedman, 2000). To better understand this relationship, the authors conducted a meta-analysis of conscientiousness-related traits and the leading behavioral contributors to mortality in the United States (tobacco use, diet and activity patterns, excessive alcohol use, violence, risky sexual behavior, risky driving, suicide, and drug use). Data sources were located by combining conscientiousness-related terms and relevant health-related behavior terms in database searches as well as by retrieving dissertations and requesting unpublished data from electronic mailing lists. The resulting database contained 194 studies that were quantitatively synthesized. Results showed that conscientiousness-related traits were negatively related to all risky health-related behaviors and positively related to all beneficial health-related behaviors. This study demonstrates the importance of conscientiousness' contribution to the health process through its relationship to health-related behaviors.

AB The DSM's major-depression "bereavement exclusion" eliminates bereavement-related depressive episodes (BRDs) from diagnosis unless they are "complicated" by prolonged duration or certain severe symptoms. The exclusion was substantially narrowed in DSM-IV to decrease false-negative diagnoses, but the impact of this change remains unknown. We divided BRDs in the National Comorbidity Survey into uncomplicated versus complicated categories using broader DSM-III-R and narrower DSM-IV exclusion criteria. Using 6 pathology validators (symptom number, melancholic depression, suicide attempt, interference with life, medication for depression, and hospitalization for depression), we compared the validity of the 2 exclusion criteria sets using 2 tests: (1) which criteria set yielded less pathological uncomplicated cases or more pathological complicated cases; (2) which yielded the largest separation between uncomplicated and complicated pathology levels. Results of both tests indicated that the narrower DSM-IV criteria substantially decreased the exclusion's validity. These results suggest caution regarding the current proposal to eliminate the bereavement exclusion in DSM-5.

AB This article compares three methods for estimating the medical cost burden of intimate partner violence against U.S. adult women (18 years and older), 1 year postvictimization. To compute the estimates, prevalence data from the National Violence Against Women Survey are combined with cost data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, the Medicare 5% sample, and published studies and with relative risk estimates from published studies. Results are compared and reasons for difference are explored, including the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. Estimates of the medical cost burden of intimate partner violence within the first 12 months after victimization range from $2.3 billion to $7.0 billion, depending on the method used. Although limited to women victimized in the last year, each method reveals that intimate partner violence imposes a substantial burden on the health care system. Among the approaches, there is no clear gold standard nor any evidence of bias.

AB The current paper evaluates psychiatric needs of voluntary admissions in a large urban psychiatric hospital through a retrospective chart review, as this research is limited within the United States. A total of 581 voluntary adult psychiatric admission charts were reviewed. Continuous variables were evaluated using an ANOVA while associations between variables were examined by an unadjusted Pearson correlation coefficient a stepwise linear regression analysis. Men were significantly more likely to have a past admission for psychiatric services (p = .016), suicidal ideation (p < .001) and test positive for substances (p < .001) than women, and were more likely to be unemployed, homeless and without insurance. Women were more likely to have a past suicide attempt and a depressive disorder. A significant relationship between gender and rationale for seeking voluntary admission (p < .001) was found. This study offers understanding of male and female voluntary admissions, and a foundation for improving treatment interventions to reduce recurrent readmissions.

AB Because of the high comorbidity of substance use disorders, affective and/or anxiety disorders and the complicated therapy, we tried to give a contemporary review on the comorbidity of these disorders with a specific focus on epidemiology, causes and treatment options. Due to the plentitude of abstracts retrieved with the predefined keywords, cited references were limited to clinically relevant publications. Between 45 and 72% of the substance use disorder patients suffer at least from one additional psychiatric disorder. Furthermore, the comorbidity between both disorders is associated with adverse outcome and a high risk of suicide. Recent research indicates that comorbidity is caused by common and disease specific genetic factors, environmental factors disorder and substance specific effects. Although antidepressant pharmacotherapy is effective treatment among patients suffering from comorbid substance use disorder, its effects on abstinence and on alcohol and substance consumption are rather low. Thus, further substance specific pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic methods should be applied.

AB Per capita consumption of alcohol has traditionally been considered to be the leading indicator of population levels of alcohol problems. However, some recent research suggests that this relationship may be weakening, and that drinking pattern measures may be preferable to per capita consumption as problem-level indicators. We compared the ability of per capita alcohol consumption and survey-based measures of alcohol use to predict deaths from injuries in Ontario, Canada, for the period 1977-1996. Per capita consumption and percentage of daily drinkers were significantly related to injury mortality, but percentage of drinkers and percentage of episodic heavy drinkers (those who drank five or more drinks on a drinking occasion) were not. Of the measures we examined, per capita consumption was the strongest indicator of mortality rates from injuries. However, the survey-derived measure of percentage of daily drinkers was similar to per capita consumption in ability to predict problem levels.

AB Objective: This study examined the prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideation among U. S. Chinese older adults. Method: Guided by the community-participatory research approach, the PINE (Population Study of Chinese Elderly in Chicago) study is a population-based epidemiological study conducted from 2011 to 2013 of 3,159 community-dwelling Chinese adults aged 60 years and above in the Greater Chicago area. Results: The 2-week prevalence of suicidal ideation, 12-month prevalence of suicidal ideation, and lifetime suicidal ideation were 3.5%, 4.8%, and 9.4%, respectively. Age, sex, marital status, education, income, living arrangement, country of origin, years in the United States, overall health status, quality of life, and health changes over the past year were significantly correlated with suicidal ideation. Discussion: Suicidal ideation was common among U. S. Chinese older adults in the Greater Chicago area. Further longitudinal studies should be conducted to explore the risk and protective factors associated with suicidal ideation.

   COMORBIDITY; PSYCHOSIS; ALCOHOL; CANNABIS; PATTERNS; ONSET
AB The co-occurrence of a severe mental illness and a substance use or abuse disorder is common in the United States as well as internationally and could be considered as more the expectation than the exception when assessing patients with serious mental illness. Substance use disorders can occur at any phase of the mental illness, perhaps even inducing psychosis. Causes of this comorbidity may include self-medication, genetic vulnerability, environment or lifestyle, underlying shared origins, and/or a common neural substrate. The consequences of dual diagnosis include poor medication compliance, physical comorbidities and poor health, poor self-care, increased suicide risk or aggression, increased sexual behavior, and possible incarceration. All of these factors contribute to a greater health burden, which reduces the health care system's capacity to adequately treat patients. Therefore, screening, assessment, and integrated treatment plans for dual diagnosis that can address both the addiction disorder and the mental illness are recommended in order to provide accurate treatment, aftercare, and other health care to accommodate patients' social and vocational needs.

AB To date, no studies have investigated emotional abuse of adult Latina women by their mothers despite evidence that emotional maternal abuse may significantly contribute to the emotional abuse experienced by Latina women in their lifetime. Cross-sectional data including 316 women was analyzed using mediation and logistic regression. Overall, 7.1 % of mothers and 24.1 % of daughters abused drugs; and, 19.5 % of daughters were emotionally abused by their mothers. Mother's attachment to her daughter mediated the association between mother's drug abuse and emotionally abusing her adult daughter (indirect effect: 0.863). Latina women can serve as perpetrators of emotional abuse of their adult children. Since drug-abusing daughters are more likely to be victims of emotional abuse by their mothers and drug-abusing mothers are more likely to abuse their daughters, drug-rehabilitation practitioners should incorporate a family abuse component into rehabilitation programs.

   ADOLESCENT; GENDER; ORIENTATION; IDENTITY; BEHAVIOR
AB As psychological research on sexual-minority (i.e., nonheterosexual) adolescents has increased over the past 20 years, it has become increasingly, segregated from research on mainstream heterosexual youths, as if the knowledge gleaned from each population had nothing to offer our understanding of the other. To the contrary, understanding of both populations would be greatly improved by integrating investigations of sexual-minority, issues into mainstream psychological research on adolescents. I outline 4 weaknesses in contemporary research on sexual-minority youth that stem from-and perpetuate-its historical isolation from mainstream developmental research: misspecification of the populations under study,, lack of attention to within-group diversity, failure to test alternative explanations for-and moderators of-"sexual-minority effects," and insufficient attention to the underlying processes and mechanisms through which sexual-minority effects operate. Correcting these weaknesses has important implications for future research on how same-sex and other-sex sexuality shape adolescent psychosocial development and clinical child and adolescent problems.

AB School violence is a problem in many nations, and rates of school violence in the United States are not among the highest in the world. The authors utilize a section of the TIMSS survey data to (a) explore the amount of school violence among the 37 nations in the study; (b) ascertain whether the traditional national-level predictors of crimes and delinquency explain cross-national variation in school violence; and (c) test whether factors related to the educational system are associated with levels of school violence cross-nationally. The results show that national patterns of school violence are not strongly related to general patterns of violence or lack of social integration in society. However, national systems of education that produce greater achievement differences between high-achieving and low-achieving students tend to record more violence. The authors suggest further studies and testing of one possible remedy for school violence: equalizing the quality of education that all students receive.

AB To examine how perceptions of safety are influenced as more people in a community acquire firearms, we conducted a nationally representative random digit-dial survey of 2,500 adults and asked whether respondents would feel more safe, less safe, or equally safe if more people in their community were to acquire guns. We used multivariable logistic regression to explore correlates of perceived safety while taking into account various confounders. Fifty percent of respondents reported that they would feel less safe if more people in their community were to own guns; 14% reported they would feel more safe. Women and minorities were more likely than were men and Whites to feel less safe as others acquire guns, with Odds ratios of 1.7 and 1.5, respectively. Our findings suggest that most Americans are not impervious to the psychological effects of guns in their community, and that, by a margin or more than 3 to 1, more guns make others in the community feel less safe rather than more safe.

AB Although often perceived to be a problem of the young, violence commonly affects older adults, a rapidly growing segment of the population. Violence can be directed toward older adults (elder abuse and intimate partner violence), self-directed (suicide), or perpetrated by older adults against others (intimate partner violence and violence in dementia). Across forms of violence, firearm access increases lethality, and veterans may be a particularly high-risk population. The forms of violence in older adults have some common risk factors (such as medical or psychiatric illness) and common challenges for prevention (such as balancing autonomy and well-being in vulnerable adults). The integration of prevention strategies across the life span, disciplines, and forms of violence offers promise for promoting older adult health and well-being. Looking forward, key areas for attention will include raising awareness about these topics and prioritizing funding for the implementation and evaluation of violence prevention interventions in health care settings and the community.

ID ASSISTED SUICIDE; UNITED-STATES; LIFE; END
AB Introduction Most physicians are against active euthanasia. Very little is known about the possible changes in the attitudes of physicians.
   Methods A questionnaire was sent to a random sample of 1003 Finnish physicians of working age. A similar questionnaire had been sent to a random sample of Finnish physicians also in 1993 and 2003. The questionnaire consisted of statements about euthanasia, for which the participants were asked to express their agreement or disagreement on a 5-point Likert scale.
   Results In general, Finnish physicians' attitudes towards active euthanasia have become considerably more positive. In 2003, 61% of the respondents were against the legalisation of euthanasia and 29% supported it. In 2013, both groups were of equal size (46%). The willingness to perform active euthanasia has not, however, increased significantly, even in a legalised setting.
   Conclusions The attitudes of Finnish physicians towards active euthanasia became considerably more positive between 2003 and 2013. There was no significant change, however, in the willingness to practice euthanasia if it became legal.

TI Terrorism and the Kenyan Public
SO STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM
LA English
DT Article
AB Since 11 September 2001, terrorism has been a global security threat. One of the partners in the war on terrorism is Kenya. Considering Kenya's recent experience with terrorist acts, their effects on its public psyche, and Kenya's reactions to them in domestic and foreign policies, this study presents perceptions on terrorism from an exploratory survey in Kenya. Respondents feel most threatened not by terrorism but by AIDS and local criminals. Among terrorist acts, the most threatening include suicide terrorism, a plane crash, and stabbing attacks. Media reports on terrorism not only intensify feelings of anxiety and helplessness but also strengthen feelings for both peaceful and revengeful reactions. In order to prevent terrorist attacks, routine security checks, recognizing a Palestinian right to statehood, and intelligence collaboration with the CIA and Mosad are considered the most effective measures. Kenya's commitment to the war on terrorism may be less a response to Kenyans' perceptions of terrorist threats than a policy to support the United States against terrorists in exchange for U. S. support against AIDS and for political stability, democracy, pluralism, and economic development.

AB ObjectiveTo examine the differential association of heterosexism and racism on depression as moderated by socioeconomic status (SES) among sexual minority people of color.
   MethodA cross-sectional sample of sexual minority people of color (n=170) was surveyed on their experiences of heterosexism, racism, depression, and SES in a national online study based in the United States.
   ResultsBivariately, SES was inversely associated with depression, racism, and heterosexism. Moderation analyses found that for individuals with less socioeconomic advantage, the associations between heterosexism and depression were not as strong. However, at higher socioeconomic advantage, heterosexism was more strongly positively associated with depression.
   ConclusionThese results suggest that the effects of discrimination on depression in sexual minority individuals of color may be accentuated at higher socioeconomic levels. Implications suggest helping sexual minority clients of color from higher SES backgrounds explore the effects of discrimination on their mental health.

AB We examined income source and match between recommended and received care among users of community mental health services. We conducted a secondary analysis of needs-based planning data on adults in Ontario community mental health programs from 2000 to 2002. The outcome was whether clients were severely underserved (yes/no) based on the match between level of care recommended and received. A logistic regression model investigated if income source predicted this outcome. 13% of clients were severely underserved. Over 40% were on public assistance and they had a higher risk of being severely undeserved than the others. Men were at greater risk. One aim of mental health reform is to increase access to care for vulnerable individuals. The finding that among users of community mental health services, individuals with public assistance income support are most vulnerable to being severely underserved should be considered by service planners and providers.

AB Among older Chinese adults in the United States, depression is a common health problem. Using data from the first population-based survey of older Chinese Americans (N = 2,929) and applying negative binomial and ordinary least squares regression models, this study examines the relationship between social engagement (including cognitive activity and social activity) and sense of loneliness and hopelessness. Findings reveal that social engagement is significantly and negatively related to both loneliness and hopelessness after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and health status. In addition, it is found that different aspects of social engagement present differential associations with sense of loneliness and hopelessness: Social activity is significantly associated with lower rate ratios of loneliness, whereas cognitive activity is significantly related to reduced levels of hopelessness. Our findings address the importance of engaging in cognitively stimulating and socially integrating activities in promoting psychological well-being for U.S. Chinese older adults.

AB In this study, we examined sociodemographic, persecutor identity, torture, and postmigration variables associated with suicidal ideation in a clinical sample of 267 immigrant survivors of torture who have resettled in New York City. The purpose of this study was to identify variables associated with increased risk for suicidal ideation in survivors of torture before they receive legal, psychological, or medical services for torture-related needs. Results from a binary logistic regression model identified a combination of 3 variables associated with current suicidal ideation at intake into the program. Being female, having not submitted an application for asylum, and a history of rape or sexual assault were significantly associated with suicidal ideation at intake, when also controlling for several other important variables. The final model explained 21.4% of variation in reported suicidal ideation at intake. The discussion will focus on the importance of conducting a thorough assessment of suicidal ideation in refugees and survivors of torture.

TI Burnout and mental health of physicians
SO JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION

DT Article
DE Burnout; psychological; Mental health; Stress; Physicians
AB The World Health Organization has included burnout in the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases as an occupational phenomenon that involves "factors influencing health status or contact with health services." Burnout is a syndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed. It manifests as exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced job satisfaction. In the United States, more than 50% of physicians have reported burnout, and their suicide rate is more than twice as high as that of the general population. Burnout in physicians is linked with increased irritability, depression, and medical errors in practice, and decreased job satisfaction, work efficacy, and concentration. Most physicians have pointed to administrative burdens outside of clinical practice as the major cause of burnout. To prevent physician burnout, regular evaluations of stress and self-awareness of one's burnout status are essential. Each physician should make proactive lifestyle changes to reduce job-related stress, such as regular exercise, seeking help, ensuring enough rest, and fostering good interpersonal relationships. Awareness and prevention of burnout are important not only for physicians' mental health, but also for patients' care.

AB Men constitute 82% of the approximately 250,000 people in the United States living with a spinal cord injury. Unfortunately, however, little is known about the impact of men's adherence to gender norms on their adjustment to such injuries. The present investigation examined the utility of masculine norms in explaining variance in depression beyond that accounted for by commonly identified predictors of men's adjustment following spinal cord injury. As hypothesized, results suggested that men's adherence to masculine norms accounted for unique variance in their depression scores beyond that contributed by social support, environmental barriers/access, and erectile functioning. Respondents who adhered to norms stressing the primacy of men's work demonstrated lower rates of depression, whereas those who conformed to norms for self-reliance demonstrated higher depression scores. The authors discuss future research directions and potential psychotherapeutic strategies for working with men with spinal cord injuries.

AB Mood disorders are common mental illnesses. Among the factors associated with major depression are exposures to infectious diseases including hepatitis C, influenza, varicella-zoster, and herpes viruses. In this study, we sought to evaluate further associations between viral exposure and depression. From the US Center for Disease Control's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, we obtained data about depression status, antidepressant use, exposure to hepatitis A, hepatitis B, herpes simplex virus type 1, herpes simplex virus type 2, human immunodeficiency virus, and cytomegalovirus, and sociodemographic variables and evaluated associations between depression and viral exposure in adjusted multivariable models. Herpes simplex virus type 2 was associated with an increased risk of depression, whereas hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and herpes simplex virus type 1 were not. Higher cytomegalovirus antibody levels were associated with depression in subjects seropositive for cytomegalovirus. In conclusion, exposure to herpes simplex virus type 2 and possibly cytomegalovirus are associated with depression in an adult US sample.

AB This study investigated how gender, racial, and nationality discrimination were related to the life satisfaction of female Asian international students directly and indirectly through loneliness, as well as how these pathways differed as a function of gender, racial, and nationality in-group solidarity. Participants were 216 female Asian international students from two public universities. Results demonstrated that all three types of discrimination predicted decreased life satisfaction. Loneliness mediated the relationship between perceived discrimination and life satisfaction. In addition, these mediation pathways differed as a function of in-group solidarity (e.g., sense of attachment to one's racial group), providing evidence for conditional mediation effects. Gender solidarity was a protective factor that mitigated feelings of loneliness when experiencing gender discrimination, whereas racial and nationality solidarity were risk factors for decreased life satisfaction when experiencing loneliness. We provide research implications for international student scholars and clinical implications for university staff and clinicians.

AB Objectives: We aimed to investigate how mental distress was associated with pain and injuries in a convenience sample of construction workers. Methods: A cross-sectional, mental health assessment was conducted in a convenience sample of construction workers (N = 172). A subsample participated in a clinical interview (n = 10). We used a cutoff (1.50 or greater) on Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 to determine substantial mental distress and determined associations with pain and injury outcomes. Results: The prevalence of substantial mental distress was 16% in the workers. This was supported by follow-up clinical interviews where 9 of 10 workers fulfilled the criteria for a mental disorder. Substantial mental distress was associated with both injury rate and self-reported pain. Conclusion: This pilot study strongly suggests the need for rigorous studies on construction worker mental health and how it affects their work and well-being.

AB We propose a method to decompose the young adult mortality hump by cause of death. This method is based on a flexible shape decomposition of mortality rates that separates cause-of-death contributions to the hump from senescent mortality. We apply the method to U.S. males and females from 1959 to 2015. Results show divergence between time trends of hump and observed deaths, both for all-cause and cause-specific mortality. The study of the hump shape reveals age, period, and cohort effects, suggesting that it is formed by a complex combination of different forces of biological and socioeconomic nature. Male and female humps share some traits in all-cause shape and trend, but they also differ by their overall magnitude and cause-specific contributions. Notably, among males, the contributions of traffic and other accidents were progressively replaced by those of suicides, homicides, and poisonings; among females, traffic accidents remained the major contributor to the hump.

AB Current United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved lithium salts are plagued with a narrow therapeutic window. Recent attempts to find alternative drugs have identified new chemical entities, but lithium's polypharmacological mechanisms for treating neuropsychiatric disorders are highly debated and are not yet matched. Thus, re-engineering current lithium solid forms in order to optimize performance represents a low cost and low risk approach to the desired therapeutic outcome. In this contribution, we employed a crystal engineering strategy to synthesize the first ionic cocrystals (ICCs) of lithium salts with organic anions. We are unaware of any previous studies that have assessed the biological efficacy of any ICCs, and encouragingly we found that the new speciation did not negatively affect established bioactivities of lithium. We also observed that lithium ICCs exhibit modulated pharmacokinetics compared to lithium carbonate. Indeed, the studies detailed herein represent an important advancement in a crystal engineering approach to a new generation of lithium therapeutics.

AB This paper is the archival record of the INFORMS Philip McCord Morse Lecture delivered in 2010. It considers applications of operations research to intelligence problems in national security and counterterrorism. The phrase "intelligence operations research" can be interpreted in two different ways: as intelligence operations research, meaning studies to characterize and improve the operations of intelligence agencies themselves, and as intelligence operations research, meaning the application of operations research methods to specific substantive intelligence problems. After defining intelligence, I review the intelligence production process (or the intelligence cycle) with reference to the intelligence community of the United States. I then consider the extent to which operations research has been deployed inside this intelligence community and summarize previous attempts to apply operations research methods to intelligence problems. I close with some suggestions for future intelligence operations research studies. Subject classifications: intelligence; national security; counterterrorism; intelligence operations.

AB Background Most prior studies of panic-depression comorbidity have been limited methodologically by use of small clinical samples and incomplete analyses.
   Aims General population data were used to study the association of lifetime and recent (12 months) panic-depression comorbidity with symptom severity impairment, course and help-seeking in the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS).
   Method The NCS is a nationally representative survey of the prevalences and correlates of major DSM-III-R disorders in the US household population.
   Results Strong lifetime and current comorbidity were found between panic and depression. Comorbidity was associated with greater symptom severity, persistence, role impairment, suicidality and help-seeking, with many findings persisting after controlling for additional comorbid diagnoses. Findings did not differ according to which disorder was chronologically primary.
   Conclusions Both lifetime and current panic-depression comorbidity are markers for more severe, persistent and disabling illness. Neither additional comorbid diagnoses nor the primary-secondary distinction were important moderators of these associations.

AB During adolescence, schools and peers are salient agents of gender socialization. Specifically, bullying is a common experience for many adolescents. While existing research has examined how bullying differs for girls and boys, very little has examined the ways that bullying serves to reinforce masculinity. This study combines quantitative and qualitative data to examine how bullying reinforces a specific lens of masculinity. By focusing on the experiences of bullying among middle school boys across the United States, we find that the context of school, peers, and bullying contributes to the social construction of masculinity for adolescents. By conducting a content analysis of data provided by victims, we find that many of the experiences of bullying are grounded in, or interpreted through, hegemonic masculinity. Four key themes that emerged from the data include the importance of heterosexuality, physical dominance and intimidation, acceptance and normalization of violence, and how gender intersects with other social locations. Findings from this study offer insight into how adolescent bullying perpetuates notions of masculine dominance and gender inequalities.

AB Following the landmark approvals by the United States Food and Drug Administration, the adoptive transfer of CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells has now entered mainstream clinical practice for patients with chemotherapy-resistant or refractory B-cell malignancies. These approvals have followed on from a prolonged period of pre-clinical evaluation, informing the design of clinical trials that have demonstrated unprecedented efficacy in this difficult to treat patient population. However, the delivery of autologous CAR-engineered T-cell therapy is complex, costly and not without significant risk. Here we summarize the key themes of CAR T-cell preclinical development and highlight a number of innovative strategies designed to further address toxicity and improve efficacy. In concert with the emerging promise of precision genome editing, it is hoped these next generation products will increase the repertoire of clinical applications of CAR T-cell therapy in malignant and perhaps other disease settings.

DE Jiu-Jitsu; jujutsu; Theodore Roosevelt; martial arts; manliness;

AB The emergence of Japan as a major world power in the early twentieth century generated anxiety over America's place in the world. Fears of race suicide combined with a fear of the feminizing effects of over-civilization further exacerbated these tensions. Japanese jiu-jitsu came to symbolize these debates. As a physical example of the yellow peril, Japanese martial arts posed a threat to western martial arts of boxing and wrestling. The efficiency and effectiveness of Japanese jiu-jitsu, as introduced to Americans in the early twentieth century, challenged preconceived notions of the superiority of western martial arts and therefore American constructions of race and masculinity. As Theodore Roosevelt and the U.S. nation wrestled with the Japanese and jiu-jitsu, they responded in various ways to this new menace. The jiu-jitsu threat was ultimately subjugated by simultaneously exoticizing, feminizing, and appropriating aspects of it in order to reassert the dominance of western martial arts, the white race and American masculinity.

AB This study utilized data from the National Survey of American Life (NSAL) to investigate the use of professional services and informal support among African American and Caribbean black men with a lifetime mood, anxiety, or substance use disorder. Thirty-three percent used both professional services and informal support, 14% relied on professional services only, 24% used informal support only, and 29% did not seek help. African American men were more likely than Caribbean Blacks to rely on informal support alone. Having co-occurring mental and substance disorders, experiencing an episode in the past 12 months, and having more people in the informal network increased the likelihood of using professional services and informal supports. Marital status, age, and socioeconomic status were also significantly related to help seeking. The results suggests potential unmet need. However, the reliance on informal support also suggests a strong protective role that informal networks play in the lives of Black men.

AB This study examined the mental health needs, knowledge, and utilization of counseling services among graduate students at a large university in the western United States. Almost half of graduate student respondents reported having had an emotional or stress-related problem over the past year, and over half( reported knowing a colleague who had had an emotional or stress-related problem over the past year. Self-reported mental health needs were significantly and negatively related to confidence about ones financial status, higher functional relationship with ones advisor, regular contact with friends, and being married. Utilization of counseling services was positively associated with an index of depression symptoms, the number of semesters in school, and identifying as female. Those students who had experienced a significant mental health event in the past year and had higherfunctional relationships with their advisors were significantly more likely to utilize counseling services. Findings suggest a need for increased attention to graduate student mental health needs, especially the role of financial confidence in student well-being and the relationship of graduate students with their advisors.

AB This cross-sectional, retrospective study used epidemiological and anthropological methods toward two aims: 1) to examine associations between partner violence and major depression in a community probability sample of women and 2) to provide new data on partner violence in Chinese Americans. In this study, 181 Chinese American women were interviewed, with 178 completing structured sections on CIDI 2.1 major depression and on partner violence history. Results indicate that a history of partner violence is associated with significantly higher rates of lifetime, 12-month, and current major depression in this community population. This effect is specific and independent of other factors. Partner violence also has a dose-response relationship with the severity of major depression episodes, increasing risk for severe and moderate episodes. The strength and specificity of this association, its dose-response effect, and its commonality across different populations suggest a possible causal role for partner violence needing further investigation in research on major depression in women.

AB Across four surveys (N = 6.9 million), Americans reported substantially higher levels of depressive symptoms, particularly somatic symptoms, in the 2000s-2010s compared to the 1980s-1990s. High school students in the 2010s (vs. the 1980s) reported more somatic symptoms (e.g., trouble sleeping, thinking, and remembering; shortness of breath) and were twice as likely to have seen a professional for mental issues. College students in recent years (vs. the 1980s) were more likely to report feeling overwhelmed and to believe they were below average in mental and physical health, but were less likely to say they felt depressed. Total Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scores were higher among adults in 2000 (vs. 1988), especially somatic symptoms. Teens displayed less suicidal ideation in 2011 versus 1991 and were slightly less likely to commit suicide. Thus, more subtle symptoms of depression became more prevalent even as some overt indicators of depression became less prevalent.

AB The paper is a review of the literature on the comorbidity of alcohol dependence with other psychiatric disorders. A condition when alcohol dependence is accompanied by another mental disorder is much more common than it is commonly believed. It is estimated that more than one third of people diagnosed with mental disorders, abuses or is dependent on psychoactive substances, especially alcohol; among alcohol-dependent patients 37% suffer from other mental disorders. Alcohol dependence is associated with increased risk of mood disorders more than three times higher, depression - almost four times higher, bipolar disorder - more than six times higher, anxiety disorders in general - more than twice, generalized anxiety disorder - more than four times higher, panic disorders - almost double, posttraumatic stress disorder - more than twice. Underestimating of comorbidity is an important problem during treatment of such population of patients. Social skills training can improve a stress management and decrease alcohol and drug use among dual diagnosed patients.

ID PREVENTION
AB Problem: Although parking facilities are a common feature of the landscape in the United States, little is known about their safety. Method: A dataset of parking lot fatalities for 1993-2002, created from the Census of Fatal Occupational Injury (CFOI) research file, was analyzed. Results: The most common events in parking lots were contact with objects (15%), pedestrian fatalities (13%), homicides (36%), and suicides (11%). The perpetrators of parking lot fatalities, compared to all workplace homicides, were more likely to be known to the victim. Conclusion: The 206 work-related fatalities per year in parking lots present challenges to the safety community. Although much of the risk results from the usage of motor vehicles, violent acts are even more prominent. Impact on industry: Because homicides are most prevalent in parking lots, both administrative and environmental measures may lower the risk of homicide. Although difficult to assess, various elements of the design of parking facilities may have an influence on the occurrence of injuries. (c) 2007 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd.

AB We review the international literature on a neglected aspect of maternal mortality: maternal homicide. Reported rates range from 0.97 to 10.6 per 100,000 live births. Women murdered in the perinatal period constituted a highly vulnerable group: they were younger, more likely to be from minority ethnic groups, and unmarried. Domestic violence was a significant risk factor for attempted and completed homicide. Compared to other countries, pregnancy-associated homicide rates were highest in the US. It is unclear how much of the difference to attribute to better case identification or to actual risk. Our review demonstrates pregnancy-associated homicide is an important contributor to maternal mortality, with rates comparable to suicide. Central to any prevention strategy will be identification of those at risk. The predictions are very weak because definitions, data collection, and analysis are so variable from study to study. Our findings reinforce the importance of screening for current and previous domestic violence.

AB Schizophrenia is associated with a number of anatomical and physiological abnormalities outside of the brain, as well as with a decrease in average life span estimated at 20% in the United States. Some studies suggest that this increased mortality is not entirely due to associated causes such as suicide and the use of psychotropic medications. In this article, in order to focus greater attention on the increased mortality associated with schizophrenia, we present a special case of the hypothesis that physiological abnormalities associated with schizophrenia make a contribution to the increased mortality of schizophrenia: specifically, the hypothesis that schizophrenia is a syndrome of accelerated aging. Evidence consistent with this hypothesis comes from several areas. The biological plausibility of the hypothesis is supported by the existence of established syndromes of accelerated aging and by the sharing of risk factors between schizophrenia and other age-related conditions. We propose methods for testing the hypothesis.

AB I use data from the General Social Survey (N = 8905) to evaluate whether imagining God in traditional ways is associated with attitudes towards voluntary euthanasia. Bivariate analysis reveals that individuals who imagine God as a father, a master, and a king have negative attitudes towards voluntary euthanasia. The associations between imagining God as a father and as a master and attitudes towards voluntary euthanasia hold after controlling for religious affiliation, frequency of religious attendance, views of the Bible, and other sociodemographic characteristics that predict attitudes towards voluntary euthanasia; however, the association between imagining God as a king do not. I also find that while there is no association between imagining God as a judge on voluntary euthanasia attitudes at the bivariate level, there is a significant and positive association with having favorable voluntary euthanasia attitudes in the full model, revealing a suppression effect. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating if different, distinct beliefs about the same religious object have differential associations with social attitudes and behaviors.

AB Child death reports are the leading data source used to orchestrate child fatality prevention policy. Therefore, the way in which child death is reported is crucial to how we sustain life. We sought to assess the systematic ways in which death is reported for children. Based on a qualitative analysis of medico-legal investigation reports collected from a medical examiner's office and a coroner's office, we examined several indicators of data completeness, quality, site organizational structure, and consistency. We found stark differences between the two sites, as well as issues regarding death diagnosis certainty, and a general lack in consistency in the reports' content, as well as procedures performed post-mortem. We conclude that there are some flaws in our death reporting system for child populations, which have the potential to hinder reliability and accuracy of these death reports, as well as thwart their overall usefulness in prevention policies.

AB Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe mental illness that has been largely ignored by the National Service Framework (NSF) for Mental Health. This is particularly notable because it is associated with a higher suicide rate than schizophrenia and has a greater burden of disability. The NSF offers little guidance on service models that specifically consider BD. This is of concern because of the complexities that are inherent in the management of BD. These deficiencies in the NSF may have far-reaching implications for resource allocation, service organization, and patient management and well-being. Moreover, the standards and performance targets laid out in the NSF will be difficult to meet if this important and common mental illness is not specifically catered for in mental health services. Local Implementation Teams would be well advised to take note of the recently published British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines for the management of BD.

AB Bipolar II disorder is a distinct, lifelong mental illness that affects at least 1.5 million people in the United States, is associated with a high incidence of comorbidity, and ends with completed suicide in 10% to 15% of diagnosed individuals. Bipolar II disorder is characterized by at least I major depressive episode with I or more hypomanic episodes, as opposed to manic or mixed episodes. While it is expected that there may be similarities in approaches to managing patients with bipolar I and bipolar II disorders, data suggest differential patient responses to pharmacologic treatments, supporting the need for research specifically in patients with bipolar II disorder. Despite the prevalence and severity of the disorder, a well-developed scientific database informing long-term treatment choices for bipolar II disorder as an illness differing from bipolar I disorder and major depressive disorder is virtually absent. A review of the limited and sometimes contradictory information stresses that more research is needed into prophylactic and maintenance treatment of bipolar II disorder.

AB An association between allergic disease, depression and suicidality has been reported. Objective: To explore the relationships between suicidality and asthma, allergy, internet addiction, stress, sleep quality, pain/discomfort, and depression, among emerging adults. Participants: 929 college students completed an online survey between October 2015 and April 2017. Methods: A cross-sectional study using multivariate analysis techniques was implemented. Results: Using structural equation modeling, we found that allergies and stress were directly related to pain/discomfort; pain/discomfort was associated to poor sleep, depression, and suicidality. Sleep quality was also affected by stress; while sleep, stress, pain/discomfort, and internet addiction were directly related to depression (all p < .05). Ultimately, four factors impacted suicidality: stress, pain/discomfort, depression, and, indirectly, sleep quality (all p < .05). Although allergy had some effects, these did not reach statistical significance (p < .09). Conclusion: Findings suggest that allergy might impact suicidality indirectly through increased pain/discomfort, poor sleep, and depression.

AB War causes trauma that can undo a warrior's character. Sophocles' Ajax is a good example of a traumatized warrior and some Afghanistan and Iraq veterans see striking parallels between contemporary conflicts and the Trojan War. With the United States increasingly facing asymmetrical enemies, there are now many traumatized soldiers and vets, not only suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but also committing suicide. Combat stress, being central to warfare, has until now been incurable. Today, advanced military R&D projects aim to find a magic pill to forestall PTSD. Propranolol may be such a drug, as it could be used to prevent PTSD by erasing emotional memories. However, this attempt at pharmacoprevention raises many ethical questions. Most importantly, it threatens to instrumentalize away the existential element of war and to push warfare into a posthuman age. To better understand the challenges we are facing today, it is important not only to read Aldous Huxley's Brave New World but also to go back to the Greeks.

AB It has been proposed that two distinct forms of intimate partner violence exist: intimate terrorism and situational couple violence. This article describes the distribution of factors that characterize intimate terrorism and situational couple violence, including controlling behaviors, violence escalation, and injury, among a representative sample of 331 physically assaulted women living in 11 North American cities. In addition, respondent, partner, and relationship characteristics associated with each form of violence are identified. Most women who experienced physical assault also experienced controlling behavior by their male partner. In multivariate analyses, respondent's young age, violence escalation in the relationship, partner's access to guns, previous arrests for domestic violence offenses, poor mental health, and previous suicide attempts or threats were associated with intimate terrorism, defined as experiencing one or more controlling behaviors. These results suggest that situational couple violence is rare and that moderate and high levels of controlling behaviors are associated primarily with partner factors.

AB In the past decade, the Unites States and its allies have been challenged by a different kind of warfare, exemplified by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Although suicide bombings are the most often used form of terror, military personnel must consider a wide range of attack scenarios. Among these is the intentional poisoning of water supplies to obstruct military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. To counter such attacks, the military is developing portable analyzers that can identify and quantify potential chemical agents in water supplies at microgram per liter concentrations within 10 minutes. To aid this effort we have been investigating the value of a surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy based portable analyzer. In particular we have been developing silver-doped sol-gels to generate SER spectra of chemical agents and their hydrolysis products. Here we present SER spectra of several chemical agents measured in a generic tap water. Repeat measurements were performed to establish statistical error associated with SERS obtained using the sol-gel coated vials.

AB The present study examined the predictive validity of Cluster C personality disorders (CCPDs) on major depressive disorder (MDD), using Waves 1 and 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC, N = 34,653; time interval equals 3 years). Multiple logistic regression analyses were utilized to compare respondents with MDD and a concurrent CCPD to those with MDD only. Findings demonstrated that individuals with MDD and a comorbid CCPD were significantly more likely than those with MDD only to have MDD at Time 2. The presence of comorbid CCPD in individuals with MDD also predicts the subsequent occurrence of suicide attempts at Time 2 and the new onset of Axis I anxiety disorders. The chronic and enduring personality styles and interpersonal difficulties that characterize individuals with a CCPD likely lead to the exacerbation of MDD symptoms. Clinicians should be aware of the impact that CCPDs have on the outcome of MDD.

AB The health care system in the United States is based on specific cultural beliefs that are sometimes inappropriate with groups that have different belief systems. These cultural differences can be seen in various end-of-life situations. To familiarize providers with some of the ways that culture can influence end-of-life care and decisions, the authors focus out the following three individual characteristics shown to be important in the literature: age, ethnicity, and gender. The article contains a broad overview of the (a) documented differences in the cultural interpretations of the ethical meta principles (e.g., autonomy and respect), (b) provision of medical service in general and pain management in particular to different groups, and (c) attitudes toward various end-of-life interventions and the use of advance directives. Finally, the authors summarize guidelines for making end-of-life care store culturally sensitive, which emphasize that each person must be interacted with as a unique individual.

AB Intensivists are confronted with poisoned patients on a routine basis, with clinical scenarios ranging from known drug overdose or toxic exposure, illicit drug use, suicide attempt, or accidental exposure. In addition, drug toxicity can also manifest in hospitalized patients from inappropriate dosing and drug interactions. In this review article, we describe the epidemiology of poisoning in the United States, review physical examination findings and laboratory data that may aid the intensivist in recognizing a toxidrome (symptom complex of specific poisoning) or specific poisoning, and describe a rational and systematic approach to the poisoned patient. It is important to recognize that there is a paucity of evidence-based information on the management of poisoned patient. However, the most current recommendations by the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology and European Association of Poisons Centers and Clinical Toxicologists will be reviewed. Specific poisonings will be reviewed in the second section of these review articles.

AB Objective: To determine the rates of depression, anxiety, and alcohol abuse, using modern nosology, in a random sample of residents aged 14 to 85 years living in an Arctic community.
   Method: A cross-sectional 2-step survey of randomly selected households was undertaken, using a self-report questionnaire to screen for anxiety, depression, and alcohol abuse. The survey included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Ewing and Roose's 4-question alcohol screening instrument (the CA GE questionnaire). Cut-off scores for the HADS and CA GE were found by comparing HADS and CA GE scores with scores on the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-III-R (SCID) in a stratified subsample.
   Results: Estimated rates of depression and anxiety were 26.5% and 19.0% respectively within the past week, and estimated rates of lifetime alcohol abuse were 30.5%.
   Conclusions: The estimated prevalence of psychiatric disorders in this Arctic community is higher than that indicated in previous findings on Native mental health.

AB Purpose: There have been few longitudinal studies of deliberate self-harm (DSH) in adolescents. This cross-national longitudinal study outlines risk and protective factors for DSH incidence and persistence.
   Methods: Seventh and ninth grade students (average ages 13 and 15 years) were recruited as state-representative cohorts, surveyed, and then followed up 12 months later (N = 3,876), using the same methods in Washington State and Victoria, Australia. The retention rate was 99% in both states at follow-up. A range of risk and protective factors for DSH were examined using multivariate analyses.
   Results: The prevalence of DSH in the past year was 1.53% in Grade 7 and .91% in Grade 9 for males and 4.12% and 1.34% for Grade 7 and Grade 9 females, respectively, with similar rates across states. In multivariate analyses, incident DSH was lower in Washington State (odds ratio [OR] - .67; 95% confidence interval [CI] = .45-1.00) relative to Victoria 12 months later. Risk factors for incident DSH included being female (OR = 1.93; CI = 1.35-2.76), high depressive symptoms (OR = 3.52; CI = 2.37-5.21), antisocial behavior (OR = 2.42; CI = 1.46-4.00), and lifetime (OR = 1.85; CI = 1.11-3.08) and past month (OR = 2.70; CI = 1.57-4.64) alcohol use relative to never using alcohol.
   Conclusions: Much self-harm in adolescents resolves over the course of 12 months. Young people who self-harm have high rates of other health risk behaviors associated with family and peer risks that may all be targets for preventive intervention.

AB Alcohol consumption is differentially associated with social and health harms across U.S. ethnic groups. Native Americans, Hispanics, and Blacks are disadvantaged by alcohol-attributed harms compared with Whites and Asians. Ethnicities with higher rates of risky drinking experience higher rates of drinking harms. Other factors that could contribute to the different effects of alcohol by ethnicity are social disadvantage, acculturation, drink preferences, and alcohol metabolism, This article examines the relationship of ethnicity and drinking to (1) unintentional injuries, (2) intentional injuries, (3) fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), (4) gastrointestinal diseases, (5) cardiovascular diseases, (6) cancers, (7) diabetes, and (8) infectious diseases. Reviewed evidence shows that Native Americans have a disproportionate risk for alcohol-related motor vehicle fatalities, suicides and violence, FAS, and liver disease mortality. Hispanics are at increased risk for alcohol-related motor vehicle fatalities, suicide, liver disease, and cirrhosis mortality; and Blacks have increased risk for alcohol-related relationship violence, FAS, heart disease, and some cancers. However, the scientific evidence is incomplete for each of these harms. More research is needed on the relationship of alcohol consumption to cancers, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS across ethnic groups. Studies also are needed to delineate the mechanisms that give rise to and sustain these disparities in order to inform prevention strategies.

AB Purpose: Patterns of psychostimulant (PST) use, psychological and physical factors, and family relationships were investigated in a nationally representative sample of adolescents. The differences between users of cocaine (Cc), ecstasy/MDMA, and amphetamine (EA) were analyzed, taking into account gender differences.
   Methods: Substance use, psychological factors (lifetime suicide attempts, suicidal thoughts in the previous year, visits to a mental health professional), physical factors (health and body shape perceptions (BSP), body mass index (BMI)), and family relationships (existence of disagreements with parents, relationships with mother and father) were investigated in 26,351 17-year-old French adolescents.
   Results: Lifetime suicidal behavior was strongly associated with EA use only. Suicidal ideation in the previous year was associated with Cc use among both boys and girls and associated with EA use among girls. Compared to Cc users, more EA users were overweight, while more Cc users were underweight compared to EA users. BSP, BMI, and EA use were related in girls only. Having a good or very good relationship with both mother and father was negatively associated with Cc use in boys and girls. Girls who had a good or very good relationship with their fathers seemed to be less prone to use EA. Boys with a good or very good relationship with their mothers seemed to be less prone to use EA.
   Conclusion: The results of the present study could serve as a basis for prevention and harm reduction strategies/programs targeting youth use and for the adaptation of these strategies/programs according to substance and gender.

ID CHRONIC ILLNESS; ADOLESCENT; DISEASE; LIFE
AB BACKGROUND: This study explores the relationship between self-reported physical disabilities or long-term health problems and health risk behaviors or adverse health conditions (self-reported engagement in violent behaviors, attempted suicide, cigarette smoking, alcohol and other drug use, sexual activity, physical activity, dietary behaviors, self-reported overweight [based on height and weight], physical health, and mental health) among US high school students.
   METHODS: Data were from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2005 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a cross-sectional paper-and-pencil survey collected from a representative sample of public and private high school students (grades 9 through 12) in the United States.
   RESULTS: Significantly more students with physical disabilities or long-term health problems than without described their health as fair or poor and reported being in a physical fight, being forced to have sexual intercourse, feeling sad or hopeless, seriously considering and attempting suicide, cigarette smoking, using alcohol and marijuana, engaging in sexual activity, using computers 3 or more hours per day, and being overweight (for all, p <= .05). For none of the health risk behaviors analyzed were the rates significantly lower among students with physical disabilities or long-term health problems than among other students.
   CONCLUSIONS: Young people who live with physical disabilities or long-term health problems may be at greater risk for poor health outcomes. Public health and school health programs, with guidance from health care providers, need to work with these adolescents and their families to develop and implement appropriate interventions, with particular emphasis on promoting mental health.

TI Extreme Risk Protection Orders Intended to Prevent Mass Shootings A Case

LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; VIOLENCE; FIREARMS; LEAKAGE
AB Urgent, individualized interventions to reduce firearm access, such as extreme risk protection orders (ERPOs, colloquially known as "red flag" orders), provide a rapid, focused response when risk for imminent firearm violence is high. Studies to date suggest such interventions are most commonly used to prevent suicide and are effective. Authorizing legislation has often been enacted after public mass shootings but, to our knowledge, there have been only 2 reported cases of ERPO use in efforts to prevent mass shootings. California enacted the nation's first ERPO statute, which took effect in January 2016. The authors are evaluating that statute's implementation and effectiveness and are seeking to obtain court records for all 414 cases occurring in 2016 to 2018. Based on 159 records received thus far, this article presents an aggregate summary and individual histories for a preliminary series of 21 cases in which ERPOs were used in efforts to prevent mass shootings. Most subjects were male and non-Hispanic white; the mean age was 35 years. Most subjects made explicit threats and owned firearms. Four cases arose primarily in relation to medical or mental health conditions, and such conditions were noted in 4 others. Fifty-two firearms were recovered. As of early August 2019, none of the threatened shootings had occurred, and no other homicides or suicides by persons subject to the orders were identified. It is impossible to know whether violence would have occurred had ERPOs not been issued, and the authors make no claim of a causal relationship. Nonetheless, the cases suggest that this urgent, individualized intervention can play a role in efforts to prevent mass shootings, in health care settings and elsewhere. Further evaluation would be helpful.

AB Background: Firefighter and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel experience higher rates of lifetime suicidal ideation and attempts than the general population and other protective service professions. Several correlates of suicidality (alcohol use, depression, posttraumatic stress) have been identified in the literature as applicable to firefighter/EMS populations; however, few studies to date have examined the specific correlates of suicidality (lifetime suicidal ideation and/or attempts) in a firefighter/EMS sample.
   Methods: Participants (N=3036) from a large, urban fire department completed demographic and self-report measures of alcohol dependence, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity, and lifetime suicidal ideation and attempts. Participants in this sample performed both firefighter and EMS duties, were predominately male (97%), White (61.6%), and 25-34 years old (32.1%).
   Results: Through hierarchical linear regressions, depression (beta=.22, p <.05) and PTSD symptom severity (beta-.21, p <.05) were significantly associated with lifetime suicidal ideation (R-2 =17.5). Depression (beta=.15, p <.001), and PTSD symptom severity (beta=.07, p <.01) were significantly associated with lifetime suicide attempts (R-2=5.1).
   Limitations: Several limitations are addressed in the current study. The survey was a self-report pre-existing dataset and lifetime suicidal ideation and attempts were measured using sum scores. Additionally, the disproportionately large sample of males and large, urban setting, may not generalize to female firefighters and members of rural community fire departments.
   Conclusions: The current study highlights the importance of targeting depression and PTSD symptom severity in efforts to reduce suicidality in firefighter/EMS personnel.

AB The present study examined the relationship between sexual behaviors and mental disorders and suicidality in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication, a representative sample of adults ages 18 years and older (N = 5,692). The World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to make DSM-IV based disorder diagnoses. Participants were also asked about suicidality and sexual behaviors. Multiple logistic regression analyses adjusted for sociodemographic variables were used to examine the relationships of three sexual behaviors (age of first intercourse, number of past year partners, and past year condom use) with 15 mental disorders (clustered into any mood, anxiety, substance use, and disruptive behavior groups) and suicidality (ideation and attempts). Compared to ages 15-17, those with age of first intercourse between 12 and 14 had increased rates of lifetime disruptive behavior, substance use, and any mental disorder, and suicidal ideation and attempts (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) range, 1.46-2.01). Those with age of first intercourse between ages 18-25 and 26-35 were at decreased likelihood of several lifetime disorder groups (AOR range, 0.19-0.81). Individuals who had two or more sexual partners in the past year had increased rates of all past year disorder groups examined (AOR range, 1.44-5.01). Never married participants who rarely/never used condoms were more likely than those who always used condoms to experience any mood, substance use, and any mental disorder, and suicide attempts (AOR range, 1.77-8.13). Future research should longitudinally examine these associations and account better for possible familial and personality confounders.

AB Despite a growing mental health crisis in the United States, empirical indicators of what could make a depression help-seeking message effective and why are currently not available. Even worse, some depression help-seeking messages can activate negative beliefs among depressed individuals that may make help-seeking even less likely than before. The current study is based on the premise that normative theoretical frameworks used for health promotion purposes might not work in populations affected by depression. Addressing a primary driver for health behavior change in gain-and-loss framing, the present research examines the nature of risk perceptions regarding help-seeking among those with depressive symptomatology who have not yet sought help (N = 738) to inform more effective suicide prevention efforts. Previously, quantitative analyses revealed that the effectiveness of gain-and-loss framing, particularly on attitudes toward help-seeking, depends on the severity of depressive symptomatology. Whereas a persuasive gain-frame advantage was found for those with mild and severe depression symptoms, both framing strategies appeared to backfire and worsen attitudes among those with moderately severe depression symptoms. The present study enriches those results by conducting an in-depth analysis of risk perceptions regarding help-seeking to inform more effective depression help-seeking messages. Risk perceptions were primarily indicative of stigma and the related resistance to seeking help. Judgment and mistreatment were expected not only from the general public but also from the mental health professionals from whom help should be sought. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB Firearm injury is a leading cause of injury-related morbidity and mortality in the United States. We sought to systematically identify and summarize existing literature on clinical firearm injury prevention screening and interventions. We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycInfo, and ClinicalTrials.gov for English-language original research (published 1992-2014) on clinical screening methods, patient-level firearm interventions, or patient/provider attitudes on the same. Unrelated studies were excluded through title, abstract, and full-text review, and the remaining articles underwent data abstraction and quality scoring. Of a total of 3,260 unique titles identified, 72 were included in the final review. Fifty-three articles examined clinician attitudes/practice patterns; prior training, experience, and expectations correlated with clinicians' regularity of firearm screening. Twelve articles assessed patient interventions, of which 6 were randomized controlled trials. Seven articles described patient attitudes; all were of low methodological quality. According to these articles, providers rarely screen or counsel their patients-even high-risk patients-about firearm safety. Health-care-based interventions may increase rates of safe storage of firearms for pediatric patients, suicidal patients, and other high-risk groups. Some studies show that training clinicians can increase rates of effective firearm safety screening and counseling. Patients and families are, for the most part, accepting of such screening and counseling. However, the current literature is, by and large, not high quality. Rigorous, large-scale, adequately funded studies are needed.

AB Since the drop in the bed capacity of civil psychiatric hospitals, an increase in the bed capacity of forensic psychiatric care and prison units has been reported in the United States and Europe. However, in Canada, a decrease in the number of people with severe mental illness (SMI) during the last two decades in penitentiaries has been reported. At the same time, an increase in individuals found not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder (NCRMD) was observed in forensic hospitals. The aim of this study is to compare incarcerated severely mentally ill (I-SMI) individuals with forensic-hospitalized SMI individuals in terms of their clinical profiles and service use in the province of Quebec (Canada). A case-control study design was selected using a sample of 44 I-SMI individuals and 59 forensic-hospitalized SMI individuals. Important findings include the following: I-SMI persons had less schooling; they more often reported suicide attempts and violent and non-violent crimes; and they had a higher level of comorbidity involving Cluster B personality disorders and substance-use disorders. Forensic-hospitalized SMI persons were more likely to have been receiving psychiatric follow-up before hospitalization. The final logistic regression model showed that lifetime suicide attempts, non-violent crimes, and psychopathic traits were higher among I-SMI individuals than among forensic-hospitalized SMI individuals. In contrast, receiving regular psychiatric follow-up was associated with forensic-hospitalized SMI individuals. Differences in psychopathological characteristics and the use of mental health services were found for I-SMI persons. More research is needed to determine which new initiatives might be efficacious in addressing the mental health needs of I-SMI individuals.

AB We sought to examine whether the presence of a noncancer pain condition is independently associated with an increased risk for suicidal ideation, plan, or attempt after adjusting for sociodemographic and psychiatric risk factors for suicide and whether risk differs by specific type of pain. We analyzed data from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication, a household survey of U.S. civilian adults age 18 years and older (n = 5692 respondents). Pain conditions, nonpain medical conditions, and suicidal history were obtained by self-report. DSM-IV mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders were assessed using the World Health Organization's Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Antisocial and borderline personality traits were assessed with the International Personality Disorder Examination screening questionnaire. In unadjusted logistic regression analyses, the presence of any pain condition was associated with lifetime and 12-month suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt. After controlling for demographic, medical, and mental health covariates, the presence of any pain condition remained significantly associated with lifetime suicidal ideation (odds ratio, 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.8) and plan. Among pain subtypes, severe or frequent headaches and "other" chronic pain remained significantly associated with lifetime suicidal ideation and plan; "other" chronic pain was also associated with attempt.
   Perspective: The risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors that may accompany back, neck, and joint pain can be accounted for by comorbid mental health disorders. There may be additional risk accompanying frequent headaches and "other" chronic pain that is secondary to psychosocial processes not captured by the mental disorders assessed (C) 2008 by the American Pain Society

AB Background: Identifying the bipolar (BP) spectrum, including the classic Bipolar I subtype (BP-I), Bipolar II (BP-II) and subthreshold bipolar disorders not meeting DSM-IV diagnostic criteria has raised growing interest, as these softer expressions of bipolar spectrum have been underdiagnosed in spite of clinical consequences.
   Methods: Data are from the Sao Paulo Epidemiological Catchment Area Study (N = 1464). Non-affective controls were compared to BP spectrum groups, based on DSM-IIIR and on the "clinical significance" criteria: Subsyndromal Hypomania (SSH) and Manic Symptoms (MS).
   Results: The lifetime prevalence of BP subgroups was 8.3% (N = 122). All BP-I and II and around 75% of SSH and MS subjects had a lifetime depressive syndrome. Compared to controls and MS subjects, BP-I, BP-II and SSH groups searched more medical help and mental health services. SSH group displayed higher rates of clinical significance than BP-I subjects, and suicidality was higher in BP groups compared to controls. Even the softer MS group had higher rate of suicide attempts than SSH subjects.
   Limitations: This is a cross-sectional study and interviews were conducted by lay personnel. Replication in bigger community samples using a mood spectrum approach is necessary to confirm these findings. However, our findings were very similar to those obtained by other authors.
   Conclusion: Softer expressions of BP disorders appear in 6.6% of this community sample and have serious clinical consequences, which supports the importance of including these categories in the BP spectrum. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose/Objectives: To describe the development and feasibility of a protocol for nonpsychiatric subspecialty research staff members to screen research participants who endorse suicidal ideations or behaviors during data collection.
   Design: Descriptive protocol development.
   Setting: The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania.
   Sample: 186 mother caregivers and 134 adolescent or young adult survivors of childhood brain tumors, with the protocol implemented for 5 caregivers and 11 survivors.
   Methods: During telephone-and home-based interviews, the interviewer assessed the participant using the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).
   Main Research Variables: Expressed suicidal ideation or behavior.
   Findings: Implementation of the C-SSRS by nonpsychiatric subspecialty staff members was feasible and valid. Interviewers' conclusions based on this instrument matched those of the mental health professional who followed up with participants. Process notes contained themes about the participants, including anger and sadness in survivors and the physical and emotional demands of the survivor in caregivers. Progress notes for the interviewer included a reiteration of events, whether the assessment was successful, and whether the recommendation of the interviewer was in agreement with that of the mental health professional.
   Conclusions: The protocol based on the C-SSRS was useful and feasible for nonpsychiatric subspecialty staff members to use in the collection of data from survivors of childhood brain tumors and their caregivers.
   Implications for Nursing: Survivors of childhood brain tumors and their caregivers may experience psychosocial distress. Nurses, as research assistants or in other roles, can use tools such as the C-SSRS to assist in front-line assessments.

AB OBJECTIVE: Guidelines and quality of care measures for the evaluation of adolescent suicidal behavior recommend prompt mental health evaluation, hospitalization of high-risk youth, and specific follow-up plans all of which may be influenced by sociodemographic factors. The aim of this study was to identify sociodemographic characteristics associated with variations in the evaluation of youth with suicidal behavior.
   METHODS: We conducted a large cohort study of youth, aged 7 to 18, enrolled in Tennessee Medicaid from 1995 to 2006, who filled prescriptions for antidepressants and who presented for evaluation of injuries that were determined to be suicidal on the basis of external cause-of-injury codes (E codes) and ICD-9-CM codes and review of individual medical records. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were performed to assess the relationship between sociodemographic characteristics and documentation of mental health evaluation, hospitalization, and discharge instructions.
   RESULTS: Of 929 episodes of suicidal behavior evaluated in an acute setting, rural-residing youth were less likely to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-0.95) and more likely to be medically hospitalized only (AOR 1.92; 95% CI 1.39-2.65). Female subjects were less likely to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital (AOR 0.55; 95% CI 0.41-0.74) and more likely to be discharged home (AOR 1.44; 95% CI 1.01-2.04). Only 40% of those discharged to home had documentation of discharge instructions with both follow-up provider and date.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this statewide cohort of youth with suicidal behavior, there were significant differences in disposition associated with sociodemographic characteristics.

AB Background: Responding effectively to a patient request for physician-assisted suicide (PAS) is an important clinical skill that involves careful evaluation. Clinician responses to PAS requests, however, have only been described using data obtained from clinicians.
   Objective: To describe qualities of clinician-patient interactions about requests for PAS that were valued by patients and their family members.
   Participants and Methods: Intensive qualitative case study involving multiple longitudinal interviews conducted prospectively with patients pursuing PAS and with their family members and retrospectively with family members of deceased patients who seriously pursued PAS. The study setting was community based. Participants were recruited through patient advocacy organizations, hospices, and grief counselors. A total of 35 cases were studied: 12 were prospective and 23 were retrospective. Study procedures involved semistructured interviews that were audiotaped, transcribed, reviewed, and analyzed by a multidisciplinary research team. Results: Three themes were identified that describe qualities of clinician-patient interactions that were valued by patients and family members: (1) openness to discussions about PAS; (2) clinician expertise in dealing with the dying process; and (3) maintenance of a therapeutic clinician-patient relationship, even when clinician and patient disagree about PAS.
   Conclusions: These patient and family accounts reveal missed opportunities for clinicians to engage in therapeutic relationships, including discussions about PAS, dying, and end-of-life care. Clinicians responding to patients requesting PAS need communication skills enabling them to discuss PAS and dying openly, as well as expertise in setting reasonable expectations, individualizing pain control, and providing accurate information about the lethal potential of medications.

TI French hospital nurses' opinion about euthanasia and physician-assisted
   suicide: a national phone survey

LA English
DT Article

AB Background: Hospital nurses are frequently the first care givers to receive a patient's request for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (PAS). In France, there is no consensus over which medical practices should be considered euthanasia, and this lack of consensus blurred the debate about euthanasia and PAS legalisation. This study aimed to investigate French hospital nurses' opinions towards both legalisations, including personal conceptions of euthanasia and working conditions and organisation.
   Methods: A phone survey conducted among a random national sample of 1502 French hospital nurses. We studied factors associated with opinions towards euthanasia and PAS, including contextual factors related to hospital units with random-effects logistic models.
   Results: Overall, 48% of nurses supported legalisation of euthanasia and 29%, of PAS. Religiosity, training in pallative care/pain management and feeling competent in end-of-life care were negatively correlated with support for legalisation of both euthanasia and PAS, while nurses working at night were more prone to support legalisation of both. The support for legalisation of euthanasia and PAS was also weaker in pain treatment/palliative care and intensive care units, and it was stronger in units not benefiting from interventions of charity/religious workers and in units with more nurses.
   Conclusions: Many French hospital nurses uphold the legalisation of euthanasia and PAS, but these nurses may be the least likely to perform what proponents of legalisation call "good" euthanasia. Improving professional knowledge of palliative care could improve the management of end-of-life situations and help to clarify the debate over euthanasia.

   ATTITUDES; BELGIUM; DEATH
AB Background: The aims of this study were to obtain information about the characteristics of requests for euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (EAS) and to distinguish among different types of situations that can arise between the request and the physician's decision.
   Methods: All general practitioners in 18 of the 23 Dutch general practitioner districts received a written questionnaire in which they were asked to describe the most recent request for EAS they received.
   Results: A total of 3614 general practitioners responded to the questionnaire (response rate, 60%). Of all explicit requests for EAS, 44% resulted in EAS. In the other cases the patient died before the performance (13%) or finalization of the decision making (13%), the patient withdrew the request (13%), or the physician refused the request (12%). Patients' most prominent symptoms were "feeling bad," "tiredness," and "lack of appetite." The most frequently mentioned reasons for requesting EAS were "pointless suffering," "loss of dignity," and "weakness." The patients' situation met the official requirements for accepted practice best in requests that resulted in EAS and least in refused requests. A lesser degree of competence and less unbearable and hopeless suffering had the strongest associations with the refusal of a request.
   Conclusions: The complexity of EAS decision making is reflected in the fact that besides granting and refusing a request, 3 other situations could be distinguished. The decisions physicians make, the reasons they have for their decisions, and the way they arrived at their decisions seem to be based on patient evaluations. Physicians report compliance with the official requirements for accepted practice.

AB Objective: Asian Indians had one of the highest population growth rates in California between 1990 and 2000. However, few studies have examined common causes of death in this ethnic group in California. We examined leading causes of mortality in Asian Indians in California and analyzed differences across age and sex.
   Design/Setting: Linear interpolation of 1990 and 2000 US Census data were used to calculate population sizes. California mortality data were examined to determine total number of Asian Indian deaths, and analyzed to determine causes of death across age (25-44, 45-64, >= 65) and sex subgroups.
   Main Outcome Measures: International Classification of Diseases, 9(th) and 10(th) revision codes were used to aggregate causes of mortality into disease categories of cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes, traumas/accidents/suicides, infections, and other conditions.
   Results: Cardiovascular diseases were the leading cause of death for both sexes. Cancers were the second leading cause of death for both sexes. Diabetes and traumas/accidents/suicides were the next most common cause of mortality for females and males respectively. However, differences were found between age groupings across the sexes.
   Conclusion: This analysis confirms leading causes of death found in other densely-populated Asian Indian regions. It also sheds light on emerging conditions in this Population in California. Although contributors to causes of mortality are discussed, more research is needed to understand the unique biological and socio-cultural determinants of disease in Asian Indians. Translation of this research into intervention strategies will reduce the burden of these diseases in this rapidly-growing population in California and the United States. (Ethn Dis. 2010;20:53-57)

AB Bipolar disorders (BPD) are common, with a lifelong risk of episodes of mood swings, deteriorating interepisode functioning, lower quality of life, as well as increased mortality. Comorbidity between BPD and substance use disorders (SUD) is more frequent than for any other psychiatric disorder. Substance abuse may precede, precipitate or follow the first episode of mood disorder, leading to poorer treatment compliance, an overall worse outcome, and an even higher suicide risk. We hypothesize that a common underpinning may explain the frequent association between BPD and substance abuse, namely impulsivity and irritable, hyperthymic or cyclothymic temperaments. Substance abuse causes impaired cognitive functioning in the frontal-cortical areas, including the inhibition of impulsive responses, thereby setting up a negative spiraling effect during the course of time. Abstinence may on the other hand set up neurogenesis in the damaged areas of the brain, thereby regaining executive cognitive functions necessary for compliance with treatment. We believe that a significant part of the poor prognosis related to BPD - and specifically mortality related to suicide - can be explained by undetected SUD which accompany the disorder. Early detection and prevention of SUD among bipolar patients, systematic use of recommended treatment regimes, and long-term follow-up may help these patients obtain a significantly better prognosis and quality of life. Integrated treatment of the BPD and substance abuse may prevent new mood swings, improve patient compliance and reduce suicidal acts. Specific programs for this subgroup of bipolar patients need to be implemented in general psychiatry and mood clinics.

AB Background: US children aged between 5 years and 14 years have a rate of gun-related homicide 17 times higher and a rate of gun-related suicide and unintentional firearm injury 10 times higher than other developed countries. Gun buyback programs have been criticized as ineffective interventions in decreasing violence. The Injury Free Coalition for Kids-Worcester (IFCK-W) Goods for Guns buyback is a multipronged approach to address these concerns and to reduce the number of firearms in the community.
   Methods: The IFCK-W buyback program is funded by corporate sponsors, grants, and individual donations. Citizens are instructed to transport guns, ammunition, and weapons safely to police headquarters on two Saturdays in December. Participants are guaranteed anonymity by the District Attorney's office and receive gift certificates for operable guns. Trained volunteers administer an anonymous survey to willing participants. Individuals who disclose having unsafely stored guns remaining at home receive educational counseling and trigger locks. Guns and ammunition are destroyed at a later time in a gun crushing ceremony.
   Results: Since 2002, 1,861 guns (444 rifle/shotgun, 738 pistol/revolver, and 679 automatic/semiautomatic) have been collected at a cost of $99,250 (average, $53/gun). Seven hundred ten people have surrendered firearms, 534 surveys have been administered, and similar to 75 trigger locks have been distributed per year.
   Conclusions: IFCK-W Goods for Guns is a relatively inexpensive injury prevention model program that removes unwanted firearms from homes, raises community awareness about gun safety, and provides high-risk individuals with trigger locks and educational counseling.

SO CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE prescription opioid abuse; surveillance; descriptive study
ID EPIDEMIOLOGY; DISORDERS; SUICIDE
AB Background. Prescription opioids are abused throughout the United States. Several monitoring programs are in existence, however, none of these systems provide up-to-date information on prescription opioid abuse. This article describes the use of poison centers as a real-time, geographically specific, surveillance system for prescription opioid abuse and compares our system with an existing prescription drug abuse monitoring program, the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN). Methods. Data were collected from eight geographically dispersed poison centers for a period of twelve months. Any call involving buprenorphine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, and oxycodone was considered a case. Any case coded as intentional exposure (abuse, intentional misuse, suicide, or intentional unknown) was regarded as misuse and abuse. Comparative data were obtained from DAWN. Results. Poison center rates of abuse and misuse were highest for hydrocodone at 3.75 per 100,000 population, followed by oxycodone at 1.81 per 100,000 population. DAWN emergency department (ED) data illustrate a similar pattern of abuse with most mentions involving hydrocodone and oxycodone. Poison center data indicate that people aged 18 to 25 had the highest rates of abuse. DAWN reported the majority of ED mentions among 35 to 44-year-olds. Geographically, Kentucky had the uppermost rates of abuse and misuse for all opioids combined at 20.69 per 100,000 population. Conclusions. Comparing poison center data to DAWN yielded mostly comparable results, including hydrocodone as the most commonly mentioned drug. Our results suggest poison center data can be used as an indicator for prescription opioid abuse and misuse and can provide timely, geographically specific information on prescription drug abuse.

ID RISK-FACTORS EXPLAIN; ISCHEMIC-HEART-DISEASE; LIFE EXPECTANCY;
   UNITED-STATES; DIFFERENTIALS
AB Background: Socioeconomic inequalities in mortality increased in several countries in the 1980s, but little is known about more recent trends. This study looks at how social class differences in mortality changed in Finland during 1981-1995, a period which saw drastic economic fluctuations. Methods: The study is based on the person records of the Finnish censuses of 1980, 1985 and 1990, to which the death records for 1981-1985, 1986-1990 and 1991-1995 respectively were linked. Men and women aged 35-64 years were classified into manual and non-manual classes on the basis of current or former occupation or the occupation of head of household. Results: Class differences in mortality increased during the 1980s among both men and women due to a more rapid decrease in cardiovascular mortality in the non-manual class and to a more rapid increase in mortality from alcohol-related causes of death, accidents and suicide in the manual class. In the 1990s, a period of severe economic recession, the increase in the relative mortality gap was clearly smaller than in the 1980s. This was due to the convergence between classes of trends for cardiovascular mortality and for mortality from alcohol-related causes, accidents and suicide. Conclusion: In Finland, economic recession slowed down rather than sped up the growth of relative inequalities among middle-aged men and women. Changes in mortality and socioeconomic inequalities in mortality result from a complex combination of different and even opposite trends in mortality from various causes of death. In the light of this complexity it seems unlikely that there exists any major single explanation for changes in inequalities in mortality.

AB Introduction: Injury from firearms is a significant problem in the United States, accounting for 73% of all homicides and 50% of all suicides that occurred among US residents. What is not known are the perceptions of emergency nurses regarding the impact of in-home access on the risk for firearm-related injury and death in their patient populations. The purpose of this study was to explore emergency nurses' perception of patient risk for firearm injury and in which ways that perception affected the process of ED patient screening, assessment, counseling, and discharge education.
   Methods: We employed a mixed methods, sequential, explanatory design using quantitative survey data and qualitative focus-group data.
   Results: Between 21.8 and 43.5% of respondents reported asking patients about access to in-home firearms, depending on presentation. Statistical analyses showed the single most significant factor correlated with nurses asking about the availability of a staff person who could further assess risk and offer assistance and safety counseling to patients. Another important influence was identified from focus-group discussions in which nurses reported that they felt challenged to bring up the topic of firearms in a way that did not seem confrontational.
   Discussion: Access to firearms poses risk to patients, and patient safety and the continuum of care depends upon the emergency nurse assessing patient firearms risk and taking appropriate action. The findings from this study suggest that emergency departments (1) normalize and standardize the assessment of firearms, (2) designate an ED staff member on each shift to further assess risk if a positive response is elicited, and (3) continue to improve workplace safety.

TI Suicide Ideation in Adult Survivors of Childhood Cancer: A Report From
   the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID LONG-TERM SURVIVORS; UNITED-STATES; RISK-FACTORS; CHRONIC PAIN;
   THOUGHTS; PREVALENCE; TRENDS; PLANS
AB Purpose
   To evaluate risk of suicide ideation (SI) after childhood cancer, prevalence of SI in a cohort of adult survivors of pediatric cancers was compared with prevalence in a sibling comparison group. The relationship of SI to cancer treatment and current health was examined, and the hypothesis that poor physical health is significantly associated with suicidality, after adjusting for depression, was specifically tested.
   Methods
   Nine thousand one hundred twenty-six adult survivors of childhood cancer and 2,968 siblings enrolled onto the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study completed a survey describing their demographics and medical and psychological functioning, including SI in the prior week.
   Results
   Of survivors, 7.8% reported SI compared with 4.6% of controls (odds ratio = 1.79; 95% CI, 1.4 to 2.4). Suicidality was unrelated to age, age at diagnosis, sex, cancer therapy, recurrence, time since diagnosis, or second malignancy. SI was associated with primary CNS cancer diagnosis, depression, and poor health outcomes including chronic conditions, pain, and poor global health rating. A logistic regression analysis showed that poor current physical health was significantly associated with SI even after adjusting for cancer diagnosis and depression.
   Conclusion
   Adult survivors of childhood cancers are at increased risk for SI. Risk of SI is related to cancer diagnosis and post-treatment mental and physical health, even many years after completion of therapy. The association of suicidal symptoms with physical health problems is important because these may be treatable conditions for which survivors seek follow-up care and underscores the need for a multidisciplinary approach to survivor care.

AB Current research highlights the increased risk factors that sexual minority (lesbian, gay, bisexual) and gender minority (transgender/gender non-conforming) students face as compared to their heterosexual and cisgender peers. These risk factors include higher rates of depression, suicide, substance use, school dropout, sexually transmitted infections, experiences with bullying on school campuses and increased risk of homelessness. Although this research has aided our understanding of the needs and risks of this population of youth, few articles have emerged from these data which offer a comprehensive theoretical approach to work clinically with these adolescents in school-based settings. This article explores how school mental health staff can address the behavioural health needs of sexual and gender minority students through the adoption of a Winnicottian theoretical approach. With an intensive focus on academic achievement, schools have historically been limited in their usage of evidence-based data to create programs which adequately address the mental health needs of student populations on their campuses. Yet, sexual and gender minority students are likely to be present in almost every school in the country. Schools can serve as gateways to mental health access and can offer innovative and culturally responsive practices across racial, ethnic, class, and geographic lines. As the single largest holders of the student population in the United States, schools have the ability to play a significant role in mental health service provision for sexual and gender minority youth.

TI FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH POOR OUTCOME IN PEDIATRIC NEAR-HANGING INJURIES
SO JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article

ID PULMONARY-EDEMA; COMATOSE SURVIVORS; UNITED-STATES; SUICIDE; TRENDS;
   MANAGEMENT
AB Background: Hanging injury is the most common method of suicide among children 5 to 11 years of age and near-hangings commonly occur. Adult studies in near-hanging injury have shown that need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, initial blood gas, and poor mental status are associated with poor prognosis. The literature for similar factors in children is lacking. Objectives: This retrospective, single-center study was performed to identify the clinical factors associated with neurologic outcome in children after near-hanging. Methods: Inclusion criteria included <18 years of age and a diagnosis of near-hanging or strangulation. All physician documentation was reviewed, and incidences of respiratory complications, seizure, and multiorgan failure were noted. Pediatric cerebral performance category score was based on information at discharge and was defined as favorable (score of 1-4) or unfavorable (score of 5-6). Comparisons were made between outcome groups and suspected clinical factors. Results: The median age was 11.5 years with a median initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 10. Of all patients, 25% had a prehospital cardiac arrest, and 51% were admitted to the intensive care unit. Patients with unfavorable outcomes had a lower initial pH (6.9 vs. 7.3) and initial GCS score (3T vs. 14). Patients with an unfavorable outcome had significantly higher rates of intensive care unit admission, respiratory complications, anoxic brain injury, and multiorgan failure. No patient who presented with an initial GCS score of 3T and prehospital cardiac arrest had a favorable neurologic outcome. Conclusions: This is the largest single-center study of children with near-hanging injury. An initial GCS score of 3T and prehospital cardiac arrest was uniformly associated with poor neurologic outcome. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background. During deployment and upon returning home, veterans experience emotional challenges that test their social and psychological adaptation and place them at risk for suicidal thinking. Individual variability in skill-based capacity to adaptively perceive, understand, correctly use, and manage emotions (called emotional competence) may play a role in the development of psychological suffering and suicidal thinking. Based on research in healthy and clinical samples, poor emotional competence was predicted to be associated with suicidal thinking among returning veterans. Method. Participants were selected from the W. F. Caveness Vietnam Head Injury Study (VHIS) registry, which in the late 1960s began prospectively assessing 1221 veterans). The study sample was composed of veterans examined between 2003 and 2006 and included 185 participants who at the time of assessment with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) did (N= 46) or did not endorse (N= 139) suicidal thinking then or during the previous two weeks and received performance-based measures of emotional competence (Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test; MSCEIT, Version 2.0) and theory of mind. MSCEIT subtests and theory of mind tasks were condensed via principal component analysis: Component 1 (Emotion Processing) included use, understand, and manage emotions tasks, and Component 2 (Emotion Perception) included perceive emotions. Results. Veterans endorsing suicidal thoughts showed poorer emotion processing whereas emotion perception and theory of mind tasks did not show significant group effects. In addition, veterans who endorsed thoughts of suicide were deployed at a younger age, had lower education, and tended to report more negative experiences in social interactions upon return to the United States. Conclusions. The capacity to understand, use, and manage emotionally charged stimuli and situations may represent risk factors for suicidal thinking among veterans.

AB Background: There has recently been increased interest in the relationship between physical illness, mental illness, and suicide. The present study utilizes a large community-based sample to investigate the association between certain physical conditions and suicidal behavior, among those with a history of a mood disorder.
   Methods: Data came from the nationally representative German Health Survey (N = 4181, age 18-65). Physical conditions were assessed by a general practice physician. DSM-IV mental disorders were assessed using a modified version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Among those with a lifetime mood disorders, suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts were assessed by self-report. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between physical conditions and suicidal behavior among those with a history of mood disorder.
   Results: Anxiety and substance use disorders were significantly positively associated with suicidal behavior [OR 1.61, 95% Cl 1.13-2.31 and 2.01, 95% 1.34-3.00, respectively]. After adjusting for anxiety and substance use disorders as well as sociodemographic variables, respiratory illness, hypertension, and number of physical disorders were significantly associated with suicidal behavior [AORs 1.72, 1.68, and 1.16, respectively].
   Limitations: The findings of this study are limited to adults with a history of a mood disorder. Personality disorders were not assessed.
   Conclusion: The present study suggests that among people with mood disorder, respiratory illnesses, hypertension, and number of physical conditions are associated with suicidal behavior independent of the effects of comorbid mental illness. Clinicians should recognize the contributing risk of physical health problems to suicidal behavior. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Most firearm-related injuries are nonfatal and require hospitalization. Using data on 3,257,720 hospitalizations from the National Hospital Discharge Survey (20002010), we determined overall and cause-, gender-, and race-specific trends in firearm-related hospitalization (FRH) and determinants of in-hospital firearm mortality. Types of FRH evaluated, according to International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, E-diagnostic codes, were accident (codes E922.0E922.3, E922.8, and E922.9), assault (codes E965.0E965.4), attempted suicide (codes E955.0E955.4), legal intervention (code E970), undetermined intent (codes E985.0E985.3), and war (code E991). A moderate reduction in FRH rates was observed from 2000 to 2011: from 62 FRHs per 100,000 hospitalizations to 57 per 100,000 (P-trend 0.0016). The majority of FRHs were due to assault (P-trend 0.19) or accident (P-trend 0.32) and showed no significant reduction in rates over time, whereas rates for 14 of all FRHsuthose due to attempted suicide (P-trend 0.002) and undetermined intent (P-trend 0.0029)udeclined moderately. Moderate declines were observed among both blacks (from 213.1 FRHs per 100,000 hospitalizations to 164.4 per 100,000; P-trend 0.049) and whites (from 38.4 FRHs per 100,000 hospitalizations to 32.2 per 100,000; P-trend 0.031). The decline was significant only among men (effect size 0.9, P-trend 0.004). In conclusion, the reduction in FRH was driven by a reduction in self-inflicted and undetermined injuries. FRH rates were 6-fold greater among blacks than among whites and 14-fold greater in men than in women throughout the period.

AB OBJECTIVE: Promoting safe firearm storage in pediatric primary care is one way to address youth suicide by firearm. The study objective was to determine the perspectives of primary care physicians (PCPs) and leaders of primary care practices regarding the acceptability and use of screening, counseling, and firearm locks all components of an adapted evidence based intervention known as the Firearm Safety Check.
   METHODS: In 2016, an online survey was conducted in two large US health systems. PCPs (n = 204) and leaders (n = 57) from 83 clinics were invited to participate. Respondents included 71 clinics (86%), 103 PCPs (50%), and 40 leaders (70%). Main outcomes included acceptability (6-point Likert scale, with higher scores indicating better acceptability) and use of the 3 intervention components (4-point Likert scale, with higher scores indicating greater use), as measured by an adapted validated instrument.
   RESULTS: Analyses were conducted in 2017. PCP acceptability of screening (mean = 4.28; standard deviation [SD] = 1.12) and counseling (mean = 4.56; SD = 0.89) were high, but acceptability for firearm lock provision was more neutral (mean = 3.78; SD = 1.16). Most PCPs endorsed sometimes screening (85%) and counseling (80%). Few PCPs offered firearm locks to caregivers (15%). Leaders reported consistent information.
   CONCLUSION: The acceptability of screening for firearms and safe storage counseling was high; both components were used commonly but not routinely. The acceptability of providing firearm locks was neutral, and use was rarely endorsed. This study provides important insights about areas of focus for future implementation efforts from policy and research perspectives.

AB Background: Suicide rates have risen considerably in the United States Army in the past decade. Suicide risk is highest among those with past suicidality (suicidal ideation or attempts). The incidence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive illnesses has risen concurrently in the U.S. Army. We examined the relationship of PTSD and depression, independently and in combination, and rates of past-year suicidality in a representative sample of U.S. Army soldiers.
   Methods: This study used the DoD Survey of Health Related Behaviors Among Active Duty Military Personnel (DoD HRB) (N=5927). Probable PTSD and depression were assessed with the PTSD Checklist (PCL) and the 10-item short form of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), respectively. Past-year suicidality was assessed via self-report.
   Results: Six percent of Army service members reported suicidality within the past year PTSD and MDD were each independently associated with past-year suicidality. Soldiers with both disorders were almost three times more likely to report suicidality within the past year than those with either diagnosis alone. Population-attributable risk proportions for PTSD, depression, and both disorders together were 24%, 29%, and 45%, respectively.
   Limitations: The current study is subject to the limitations of a cross-sectional survey design and the self-report nature of the instruments used.
   Conclusions: PTSD and depression are each associated with suicidality independently and in combination in the active duty component of the U.S. Army. Soldiers presenting with either but especially both disorders may require additional outreach and screening to decrease suicidal ideation and attempts. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB There has been much debate regarding the 'double-effect' of sedatives and analgesics administered at the end-of-life, and the possibility that health professionals using these drugs are performing 'slow euthanasia.' On the one hand analgesics and sedatives can do much to relieve suffering in the terminally ill. On the other hand, they can hasten death. According to a standard view, the administration of analgesics and sedatives amounts to euthanasia when the drugs are given with an intention to hasten death. In this paper we report a small qualitative study based on interviews with 8 Australian general physicians regarding their understanding of intention in the context of questions about voluntary euthanasia, assisted suicide and particularly the use of analgesic and sedative infusions (including the possibility of voluntary or non-voluntary 'slow euthanasia'). We found a striking ambiguity and uncertainty regarding intentions amongst doctors interviewed. Some were explicit in describing a 'grey' area between palliation and euthanasia, or a continuum between the two. Not one of the respondents was consistent in distinguishing between a foreseen death and an intended death. A major theme was that 'slow euthanasia' may be more psychologically acceptable to doctors than active voluntary euthanasia by bolus injection, partly because the former would usually only result in a small loss of 'time' for patients already very close to death, but also because of the desirable ambiguities surrounding causation and intention when an infusion of analgesics and sedatives is used. The empirical and philosophical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB Whether upheld as heroic or reviled as terrorism, people have been willing to lay down their lives for the sake of their groups throughout history. Why? Previous theories of extreme self-sacrifice have highlighted a range of seemingly disparate factors, such as collective identity, outgroup hostility, and kin psychology. In this paper, I attempt to integrate many of these factors into a single overarching theory based on several decades of collaborative research with a range of special populations, from tribes in Papua New Guinea to Libyan insurgents and from Muslim fundamentalists in Indonesia to Brazilian football hooligans. These studies suggest that extreme self-sacrifice is motivated by identity fusion, a visceral sense of oneness with the group, resulting from intense collective experiences (e.g., painful rituals or the horrors of frontline combat) or from perceptions of shared biology. In ancient foraging societies, fusion would have enabled warlike bands to stand united despite strong temptations to scatter and flee. The fusion mechanism has often been exploited in cultural rituals, not only by tribal societies but also in specialized cells embedded in armies, cults, and terrorist organizations. With the rise of social complexity and the spread of states and empires, fusion has also been extended to much larger groups, including doctrinal religions, ethnicities, and ideological movements. Explaining extreme self-sacrifice is not only a scientific priority but also a practical challenge as we seek a collective response to suicide, terrorism, and other extreme expressions of outgroup hostility that continue to bedevil humanity today.

AB The objective was to quantify the prevalence of dual diagnosis and to evaluate the characteristics of these patients from community mental health and substance misuse services in Madrid. The sample consisted of 837 outpatients from Madrid, 208 from mental health services and 629 from substance misuse services. We used the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and Personality Disorder Questionnaire (PDQ4+) to evaluate disorders from axis I and II. It was considered that 517 (61.8%) patients had dual pathology (current diagnoses of axis I or II disorders and an addictive disorder): 36,1% in mental health services and 70,3% in substance misuse services. There were fewer males amongst the dual patients and it was also found that they had a worse employment situation, along with higher figures of alcohol and cannabis dependence than addicts without dual diagnoses (n=194). When comparing them with patients with mental disorder diagnoses only, excluding substance use disorder (n=126), there were differences in all socio-demographic characteristics analyzed, and dual patients were associated with diagnoses of bipolar disorder, agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and had more suicide risk and different personality disorders. Thus, dual pathology is higher in patients who are in treatment and have differential characteristics (higher suicide risk, worse employment situation) that suggest greater severity that could be of help in the planning of care resource policies for these patients.

AB Objective To obtain more accurate calculations of maternal and pregnancy-related mortality ratios in Sweden from 1988 to 2007 by using information from national registers and death certificates. Design A national register-based study, supplemented by a review of death certificates. Setting Sweden, 1988-2007. Population The deaths of 27 957 women of reproductive age (1549 years). Methods The Swedish Cause of Death Register, Medical Birth Register, and National Patient Register were linked. All women with a diagnosis related to pregnancy in at least one of these registers within 1 year prior to death were identified. Death certificates were reviewed to ascertain maternal deaths. Maternal mortality ratio (the number of maternal deaths/100 000 live births, excluding and including suicides), and pregnancy-related mortality ratio (number of deaths within 42 days after termination of pregnancy, irrespective of cause of death/100 000 live births) were calculated. Main outcome measures Direct and indirect maternal deaths and pregnancy-related deaths. Results The maternal mortality ratio in Sweden, based on the current method of identifying maternal deaths, was 3.6. After linking registers and reviewing death certificates, we identified 64% more maternal deaths, resulting in a ratio of 6.0 (or 6.5 if suicides are included). The pregnancy-related mortality ratio was 7.3. A total of 478 women died within a year after being recorded with a diagnosis related to pregnancy. Conclusions By including the 123 cases of maternal death identified in this study, the mean maternal mortality ratio from 1988 to 2007 was 64% higher than reported to the World Health Organization.

ID PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY; PREVENTION STRATEGIES; DEPRESSION; CHILDREN;

AB United States (US) and European Union (EU) laws attempt to counterbalance the presumed discrimination of children in drug treatment and drug development. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-rewarded pediatric studies with antidepressants triggered in 2004 an FDA black-box warning of suicidality in young patients. Fewer antidepressants were prescribed, and the number of completed suicides of young persons increased. The dilemma between this warning and the need to adequately treat young depressed patients remains unsolved. We analyzed the history of drug development, the evolving view of diseases in young patients, US/EU pediatric laws, and pediatric studies triggered by FDA/European Medicines Agency (EMA) in depression and other diseases on the background of developmental pharmacology; financial, institutional, and other interests; and the literature. The FDA/EMA define children administratively, not physiologically, as <17 (FDA)/<18 years old (EMA). But young persons mature physiologically well before their 17th/18th birthday. Depression occurs in young persons, has special characteristics, but is not fundamentally different from adult depression. Young persons are not another species. Regulatory requirements for "pediatric" studies focus on "pediatric" labels. Many "pediatric" studies, including those in depression, lacked and lack medical sense and harm patients by placebo treatment although effective drugs exist. The FDA has partially abandoned separate "pediatric" efficacy studies, but not in psychiatry. Clinicians, parents, institutional review boards, and ethics committees should become aware of questionable "pediatric" studies, should re-evaluate ongoing ones, consider to suspend them, and to reject new ones. The concept of separate "pediatric" drug approval needs to be abandoned.

AB Background: Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide and factors contributing to its burden include chronic relapsing course, comorbidity, suicide risk, and early age at onset (AAO). In particular, recent investigation has shown that BD onset may occur earlier than previously believed, even though whether BDI and II are different in such regard is still debated. Reduced samples may, moreover, limit the confidence in the published studies, with geographic issues, in turn, representing potentially conditioning factors. The present review was aimed to select and analyze large sample studies comparing AAO in BDI vs II patients.
   Methods: A PubMed literature search was performed, considering English-written articles published up to December 2015, comparing AAO in BDI vs II patients with sample size >= 100 subjects per group.
   Results: Seventeen studies were considered suitable for revision, with 8 studies reporting statistically significant differences and 9 not. Among studies reporting statistically significant differences, mostly conducted in Europe, 6 showed an earlier AAO in BDI, while 2 in BDII subjects.
   Limitations: Only studies with large samples included, considering AAO as a continuous variable, and providing a comparison between the bipolar subtypes.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that AAO per se does not seem to reliably differentiate BDI from BDII patients and that such variable should likely be investigated in the context of other clinical characteristics, in order to assess its overall influence over BD course. Geographic factors may, in turn, play a potential role with future investigation warranted to further explore this specific issue. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Relationships among religiosity and other psychosocial factors in determining suicidal behaviors in adolescence and in emerging adulthood have been inconclusive. We sought to investigate prospective relationships among religiosity, psychosocial factors and suicidal behaviors using a nationally representative sample of adolescents emerging into adulthood.
   Method: Analysis was based on 9412 respondents from four waves of National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. A Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) procedure was used to fit a series of models on the response variable (suicidal behaviors) and a set of psychosocial and religiosity predictors taking into account the correlated structure of the datasets.
   Results: Analyses showed that adolescent suicidality and religious activity participation showed significant declines over time. Using multinomial logistic regression we found that females showed statistically significant risks of suicidal behaviors, but this effect declined in adulthood. In adjusted models, baseline attendance of a church weekly was associated with 42% reduction (95% Confidence Interval: 0.35-0.98) of suicide ideation in Wave III. Across all waves, low support from fathers (compared with mothers) consistently explained variability in suicidal behaviors among genders emerging into adulthood.
   Limitations: Accurate measurement of religiosity is psychometrically challenging.
   Conclusions: The findings of the study indicate that religious activity participation is associated with reduced suicidal behaviors among adolescents but this effect declines during emerging adulthood. Psychosocial supports particularly from fathers' have an enduring impact on reduced suicidal behaviors among adolescents and emerging adults. Prevention, identification and evaluation of disorders of suicidality need a careful assessment of underlying mental pain (psyache) to reduce the likelihood of aggravated suicide.

AB Suicidal ideation (SI) and thoughts of death are often experienced as fluctuating; therefore a dynamic representation of this highly important indicator of suicide risk is warranted. Theoretical accounts have suggested that affective, behavioral, and interpersonal factors may influence the experience of thoughts of death/SI. This study aimed to examine the prospective and dynamic impact of these constructs in relation to thoughts of death and SI. We assessed adolescents with a recent hospitalization for elevated suicide risk over 6 months. Using the methodology of the Longitudinal Interval Follow-Up Evaluation, weekly ratings for SI, course of depressive illness, affect sensitivity, negative affect intensity, behavioral dysregulation, peer invalidation, and family invalidation were obtained. Using multilevel modeling, results indicated that (a) same-week ratings between these constructs and SI were highly correlated at baseline and throughout follow-up; (b) baseline ratings of affect sensitivity, behavioral dysregulation, and peer invalidation were positive prospective predictors of SI at any week of follow-up; (c) weekly ratings of each of these constructs had significant associations with next-week ratings of SI; and (d) ratings of SI had positive significant associations with next-week ratings on each of the constructs. These results suggest that affective sensitivity, behavioral dysregulation, peer invalidation, and SI are highly associated with SI levels both chronically (over months) and acutely (one week to the next), whereas depression, negative affect intensity, and family invalidation were more acutely predictive of SI. Elevated SI may then aggravate all these factors in a reciprocal manner.

AB Most deaths in the United States occur in the context of chronic diseases in later life and are too often accompanied by potentially remediable emotional or physical suffering. Geriatric psychiatrists and other mental health professionals can contribute meaningfully to the provision of optimal care during the final phases of life. This review provides an overview of end-of-life care, focusing on issues most relevant to the geriatric psychiatrist. The author examined palliative care textbooks and review papers to determine the topics to be included in this article, and searched computerized literature databases on these topics. Many of the recommendations provided herein stem from experts' clinical experience; however empirical evidence is also incorporated and critiqued. Topics covered include conversations with patients and families about end-of-life care; the evaluation and treatment of suffering, including pain, depression, suicidality, anxiety, and delirium; the role of individual and family therapies in caring for dying patients; capacity determination; advance care planning; withholding life-sustaining treatments; and "last resort" (and, in some cases, quite controversial) options, such as terminal sedation, assisted suicide, and euthanasia. The author also notes the relevance of such end-of-life-care considerations to patients with dementia. Geriatric psychiatrists' skills across these multiple domains are of particular usefulness. Through such clinical skills and the application of empirical research tools to the many unanswered questions in the care of dying patients, geriatric psychiatry can make increasingly valuable and visible contributions to improving quality of life for people suffering from life-threatening illnesses.

AB Background: Bipolar disorder is characterized by debilitating episodes of depression and mood elevation (mania or hypomania). For most patients, depressive symptoms are more pervasive than mood elevation or mixed symptoms, and thus have been reported in individual studies to impose a greater burden on affected individuals, caregivers, and society. This article reviews and compiles the literature on the prevalence and burden of syndromal as well as subsyndromal presentations of depression in bipolar disorder patients.
   Methods: The PubMed database was searched for English-language articles using the search terms "bipolar disorder," "bipolar depression," "burden," "caregiver burden," "cost," "costs," "economic," "epidemiology," "prevalence," "quality of life," and "suicide." Search results were manually reviewed, and relevant studies were selected for inclusion as appropriate. Additional references were obtained manually from reviewing the reference lists of selected articles found by computerized search.
   Results: In aggregate, the findings support the predominance of depressive symptoms compared with mood elevation/mixed symptoms in the course of bipolar illness, and thus an overall greater burden in terms of economic costs, functioning, caregiver burden, and suicide.
   Limitations: This review, although comprehensive, provides a study-wise aggregate (rather than a patient-wise meta-analytic) summary of the relevant literature on this topic.
   Conclusions: In light of its pervasiveness and prevalence, more effective and aggressive treatments for bipolar depression are warranted to mitigate its profound impact upon individuals and society. Such studies could benefit by including metrics not only for mood outcomes, but also for illness burden. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The objective of our study was to assess the impact of injury intentionality on the outcomes and healthcare resource utilization of severely injured patients in the United States.
   Methods: The National Trauma Data Bank for the years 2001 through 2006 was used for our analysis. Adult patients with an injury severity score 15 were divided into three groups based on injury intentionality: unintentional, assault, and self-inflicted. Demographic and injury characteristics, unadjusted and fisk-adjusted mortality rates, and healthcare resource utilization variables were compared for these three groups using t tests, analysis of variance, and multivariable regression analyses where appropriate. Stata/SE version 9.2 was used for all statistical analyses. p values <0.05 were considered significant.
   Results: A total of 138,589 patients were included for analysis. After adjustment for potentially confounding variables, self-inflicted injury remained a significant predictor of increased mortality (mortality 42.3%, adjusted odds ratio for death = 2.31, 95% confidence interval 1.97-2.71), and injury by assault a significant predictor of decreased mortality (mortality 18.3%, adjusted odds ratio for death = 0.83, 95% confidence interval 0.74-0.92), when compared with unintentional injury (mortality 15.1%). Patients surviving self-inflicted injury required longer intensive care unit stays and overall hospital stays than survivors of unintentional injury.
   Conclusions: Patients who are treated for self-inflicted injury have higher risk-adjusted mortality and utilize comparatively higher levels of healthcare resources than victims of assault or patients sustaining unintentional injury. The findings of our study emphasize the need for trauma center participation in the development and maintenance of aggressive primary and secondary suicide prevention programs.

AB Objective The present study sought to identify inequalities in cause-specific mortality across different occupational groups in Korea.
   Methods The cohort included Korean workers enrolled in the national employment insurance programme between 1995 and 2000. Mortality was determined by matching death between 1995 and 2008 according to a nationwide registry of the Korea National Statistical Office. The cohort was divided into nine occupational groups according to the Korean Standard Occupational Classification (KSOC). Age-standardised mortality rates of each subcohort were calculated.
   Results The highest age-standardised mortality rate was identified in KSOC 6 (agricultural, forestry and fishery workers; male (M): 563.0 per 100 000, female (F): 206.0 per 100 000), followed by KSOC 9 (elementary occupations; M: 499.0, F: 163.4) and KSOC 8 (plant, machine operators and assemblers; M: 380.3, F: 157.8). The lowest rate occurred in KSOC 2 (professionals and related workers; M: 209.1, F: 93.3). Differences in mortality rates between KSOC 2 and KSOC 9 (M: 289.9, F: 70.1) and the rate ratio of KSCO9 to KSCO2 (M: 2.39, F: 1.75) were higher in men. The most prominent mortality rate difference was observed in external causes of death (M: 96.9, F: 21.6) and liver disease in men (38.3 per 100 000). Mental disease showed the highest rate ratio (M: 6.31, F: 13.00).
   Conclusions Substantial differences in mortality rates by occupation were identified. Main causes of death were injury, suicide and male liver disease. Development of policies to support occupations linked with a lower socioeconomic position should be prioritised.

AB This comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis aims to quantify the association between different types of childhood maltreatment and suicidality. We searched five bibliographic databases, including Medline, PsychINFO, Embase, Web of Science and CINAHL, until January 2018. Random-effects meta-analysis was employed followed by univariable and multivariable meta-regressions. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I-2 statistic and formal publication bias tests were undertaken. The methodological quality of the studies was critically appraised and accounted in the meta-regression analyses. Data from 68 studies based on n = 261.660 adults were pooled. All different types of childhood maltreatment including sexual abuse [odds ratio (OR) 3.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.76-3.64], physical abuse (OR 2.52, 95% CI 2.09-3.04) and emotional abuse (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.64-3.77) were associated with two- to three-fold increased risk for suicide attempts. Similar results were found for the association between childhood maltreatment and suicidal ideation. Complex childhood abuse was associated with a particularly high risk for suicide attempts in adults (OR 5.18, 95% CI 2.52-10.63). Variations across the studies in terms of demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants and other core methodological factors did not affect the findings of the main analyses. We conclude that there is solid evidence that childhood maltreatment is associated with increased odds for suicidality in adults. The main outstanding challenge is to better understand the mechanisms which underpin the development of suicidality in people exposed to childhood maltreatment because current evidence is scarce.

AB The risk of acetochlor to human health is still unclear, prompting concern over its risk, especially to pesticide suicides population, occupational population (farmers, retailers and pharmaceutical workers), and special population (young children and infants, pregnant women, older people, and those with compromised immune systems). This study was to explore the toxic effect and the possible mechanism of toxic action of acetochlor using zebrafish larvae whose toxicity profiles have been confirmed to be strikingly similar with mammalian. The result indicated that the toxic target organ of acetochlor was cardiovascular system. Thus, cardiovascular toxicity evaluation was investigated systematically. The main phenotypes of cardiovascular toxicity induced by acetochlor were bradycardia, pericardial edema, circulation defect, and thrombosis; Malformed heart was confirmed by histopathological examination. Thrombosis which maybe triggered by bradycardia was further studied using o-dianisidine for erythrocyte staining; Substantial thrombus in the caudal vein and significantly reduced heart red blood cells (RBCs) intensity which can reflect the thrombosis degree were observed in zebrafish in a concentration dependent manner. Additionally, the mRNA expression level of Nkx2.5 and Gata4 related to induction of cardiac program were down-regulated significantly by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), which could cause defects in the cardiovascular system. For the first time, our results demonstrated that acetochlor induced cardiovascular toxicity, and down-regulation of Nkx2.5 and Gata4 might be its possible molecular basis. Our data generated here might provide novel insights into cardiovascular disease risk following acetochlor exposure to human, especially to pesticide suicides population, occupational population and special population.

AB Aims To characterize sudden or unnatural deaths with very high-range blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) presenting to the Department of Forensic Medicine (DOFM) in Sydney between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2011.
   Design Case series.
   Setting Sydney, Australia.
   Cases A total of 263 cases of sudden or unnatural death with a BAC of 0.300g/100ml.
   Measurements Case characteristics, circumstances of death, quantitative toxicology, major autopsy findings and serology.
   Findings The mean age of decedents was 46.7years and 74.5% were male. Pre-existing alcohol problems were noted in 78.7%. Deaths were due to alcohol toxicity/chronic alcoholism (35.0%), combined alcohol/other drug toxicity (14.8%), accidents (18.6%), natural disease (13.3%), suicide (11.0%), homicide (6.8%) and one case was undetermined. Alcohol was a direct, or contributory, cause of death in 84.4% of cases. The overwhelming majority (81.4%) occurred in a home environment, and deaths did not vary by day or month. The mean BAC was 0.371g/100ml (range 0.300-0.820g/100ml), being highest in alcohol toxicity/chronic alcoholism cases (0.410g/100ml). The most frequently detected substances, other than alcohol, were benzodiazepines (31.9%) and opioids (12.9%). Alcohol-related disease was diagnosed in 62.9% of cases. Alcohol-related pathology was prevalent across all categories of death: severe steatosis (35.3%), cirrhosis (22.5%), chronic pancreatitis (15.3%), cardiomyopathy (9.4%) and cerebellar atrophy (9.0%).
   Conclusions Unnatural deaths with very high-range alcohol concentrations extend well beyond direct toxicity, and alcohol is causal in most cases. Those at greatest risk are middle-aged males, with long histories of alcohol problems.

AB Background: Economic disadvantage is associated with depression and suicide. We sought to determine whether economic disadvantage reduces the effectiveness of depression treatments received in primary care.
   Methods: We conducted differential-effects analyses of the Prevention of Suicide in Primary Care Elderly: Collaborative Trial, a primary-care-based randomized, controlled trial for late-life depression and suicidal ideation conducted between 1999 and 2001, which included 514 patients with major depression or clinically significant minor depression.
   Results: The intervention effect, defined as change in depressive symptoms from baseline, was stronger among persons reporting financial strain at baseline (differential effect size = -4.5 Hamilton Depression Rating Scale points across the study period [95% confidence interval = -8.6 to -0.3]). We found similar evidence for effect modification by neighborhood poverty, although the intervention effect weakened after the initial 4 months of the trial for participants residing in poor neighborhoods. There was no evidence of substantial differences in the effectiveness of the intervention on suicidal ideation and depression remission by economic disadvantage.
   Conclusions: Economic conditions moderated the effectiveness of primary-care-based treatment for late-life depression. Financially strained individuals benefited more from the intervention; we speculate this was because of the enhanced treatment management protocol, which led to a greater improvement in the care received by these persons. People living in poor neighborhoods experienced only temporary benefit from the intervention. Thus, multiple aspects of economic disadvantage affect depression treatment outcomes; additional work is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms. (Epidemiology 2013;24: 14-22)

AB Hospital-based studies suggest that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection causes frequent cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and mortality, but epidemiologic studies have shown less morbidity and mortality. The authors performed a retrospective cohort study of 10,259 recombinant immunoblot assay-confirmed, HCV antibody-positive (HCV+), allogeneic blood donors from 1991 to 2002 and 10,259 HCV antibody-negative (HCV-) donors matched for year of donation, age, gender, and Zone Improvement Plan Code (ZIP Code). Vital status through 2003 was obtained from the US National Death Index, and hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated by survival analysis. After a mean follow-up of 7.7 years, there were 601 (2.92%) deaths: 453 HCV+ and 148 HCV- (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.13, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.60, 3.76). Excess mortality in the HCV+ group was greatest in liver-related (HR = 45.99, 95% CI: 11.32, 186.74), drug- or alcohol-related (HR = 10.81, 95% CI: 4.68, 24.96), and trauma/suicide (HR = 2.99, 95% CI: 2.05, 4.36) causes. There was also an unexpected increase in cardiovascular mortality among the HCV+ donors (HR = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.41, 3.46). HCV infection is associated with a significant, threefold increase in overall mortality among former blood donors, including significantly increased mortality from liver and cardiovascular causes. High rates of mortality from drug/alcohol and trauma/suicide causes are likely due to lifestyle factors and may be at least partially preventable.

AB Background: A longitudinal cohort analysis of disease nonbattle injuries (DNBI) sustained by a large combat-deployed maneuver unit has not been performed. Methods: A descriptive analysis was undertaken to evaluate for DNBI casualty care statistics incurred by a U.S. Army Brigade Combat Team (BCT) during a counterinsurgency campaign of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Results: Of the 4,122 soldiers deployed, there were 1,324 DNBI with 5 (0.38%) deaths, 208 (15.7%) medical evacuations (MEDEVAC), and 1,111 (83.9%) returned to duty. The DNBI casualty rate for the BCT was 257.0/1,000 soldier combat-years. Females, compared with males, had a significantly increased incidence rate ratio for becoming a DNBI casualty 1.67 (95% CI 1.37, 2.04). Of 47 female soldiers receiving MEDEVAC 35 (74%) were for pregnancy-related issues. Musculoskeletal injuries (50.4%) and psychiatric disorders (23.3%) were the most common body systems involved with DNBI casualties. Among the BCT cohort the psychiatric DNBI casualty rate and suicide rate were 59.8 and 0.58 per 1,000 soldier combat-years. The BCT cohort incidence rates for common musculoskeletal injuries per 1,000 combat years were as follows: ankle sprain 15.3, anterior cruciate ligament rupture 3.3 and shoulder dislocation 1.2. Conclusions: Musculoskeletal injuries and psychiatric disorders accounted for 74% of the total DNBI casualties, and 43% of the DNBI casualties requiring subsequent MEDEVAC. The BCT cohort had a suicide rate nearly four times greater than previously reported, and selected musculoskeletal injury incidence rates were fivefold greater than the general population.

AB Research indicates that women firelighters may experience elevated rates ol suicidal thoughts and behaviois; however, little is known about how at-risk women firefighters interface with mental health services and other support sources. This study aimed to identify rates of mental health service use and help-seeking, correlates of service use, and preferred sources of support among women firefighters with a career history of suicidality. A sample of 119 United States women firefighters reporting a history of suicide ideation, plans, and/or attempts during their firefighting careers completed a web-based survey of behavioral health. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and logistic regression analyses were utilized to examine rates of help-seeking and correlates of service use. Of the sample, 73.1% reported seeking professional mental health services and 43.7% reported seeking other forms of support (e.g., support groups, hotlines) during then firefighting careers. Stigma concerns were most frequently cited as hypothetical barriers to care; however, rates of stigma concerns did not appear to be significantly higher among service users. Participants reported a preference for seeking care from a psychologist, therapist, and/or counselor. Findings indicate that the majority of women firefighters with a career history of suicidality have utilized mental health services or other sources of support during their firefighting careers. Results suggest that self-reported stigma may not serve as a significant barrier to mental health service utilization in this population. Further research is needed to examine the temporal relationship between suicidality and service use in a nationally representative sample of women firefighters.

AB Background: Patients with bipolar disorder from the US have more early-onset illness and a greater familial loading for psychiatric problems than those from the Netherlands or Germany (abbreviated here as Europe). We hypothesized that these regional differences in illness burden would extend to the patients siblings.
   Methods: Outpatients with bipolar disorder gave consent for participation in a treatment outcome network and for filling out detailed questionnaires. This included a family history of unipolar depression, bipolar disorder, suicide attempt, alcohol abuse/dependence, drug abuse/dependence, and "other" illness elicited for the patients' grandparents, parents, spouses, offspring, and siblings. Problems in the siblings were examined as a function of parental and grandparental problems and the patients' adverse illness characteristics or poor prognosis factors (PPFs).
   Results: Each problem in the siblings was significantly (p < 0.001) more prevalent in those from the US than in those from Europe. In the US, problems in the parents and grandparents were almost uniformly associated with the same problems in the siblings, and sibling problems were related to the number of PPFs observed in the patients.
   Limitations: Family history was based on patient report.
   Conclusions: Increased familial loading for psychiatric problems extends through 4 generations of patients with bipolar disorder from the US compared to Europe, and appears to "breed true" into the siblings of the patients. In addition to early onset, a variety of PPFs are associated with the burden of psychiatric problems in the patients' siblings and offspring. Greater attention to the multigenerational prevalence of illness in patients from the US is indicated.

AB A major task for military and civilian mental health practitioners is to screen United States service members/military personnel for an array of mental health problems (e.g., depression, alcohol abuse, suicidal ideation, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) before further assessment leading to diagnosis of mental disorders. During the assessment of such mental health problems, screening scales should be not only reliable and valid, but also have clinical utility in the military context. Busy clinicians may not have enough time to determine which screening scales meet minimal psychometric standards and proven clinical utility with predeployment or postdeployment soldiers on active duty. A sample of screening scales was identified during a thorough review of the peer-reviewed psychometric literature, textbooks on psychometrics, and the American Psychological Association PsycINFO database. Selection criteria (e.g., acceptable psychometric properties, previously used in the military context) resulted in the identification of 7 core (first-order description) screening scales recommended in the assessment of mental health problems within the military context. Core scales were organized across 4 clinical domains: general mental health functioning (e.g., Behavior and Symptom Identification Scale [BASIS]), self-harm and risk-taking behaviors (e.g., Suicide Intent Scale [SIS]), assessment of PTSD (e.g., PTSD Checklist [PCL]) and Anger Reactions (e.g., Dimension of Anger Reaction Scale [DAR]), and assessment of substance abuse/dependence (e.g., Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test -AUDIT). For each core scale, alternative scales were also selected using similar selection criteria. Implications of the study findings for the practice of military and civilian psychologists in the Department of Defense (DoD) are discussed.

AB STI rates are high for First Nations in Canada and the United States. Our objective was to understand the context, issues, and beliefs around high STI rates from a nehiyaw (Cree) perspective. Twenty-two in-depth interviews were conducted with 25 community participants between March 1, 2011 and May 15, 2011. Interviews were conducted by community researchers and grounded in the Cree values of relationship, sharing, personal agency and relational accountability. A diverse purposive snowball sample of community members were asked why they thought STI rates were high for the community. The remainder of the interview was unstructured, and supported by the interviewer through probes and sharing in a conversational style. Modified grounded theory was used to analyze the narratives and develop a theory. The main finding from the interviews was that abuse of power in relationships causes physical, mental, emotional and spiritual wounds that disrupt the medicine wheel. Wounded individuals seek medicine to stop suffering and find healing. Many numb suffering by accessing temporary medicines (sex, drugs and alcohol) or permanent medicines (suicide). These medicines increase the risk of STIs. Some seek healing by participating in ceremony and restoring relationships with self, others, Spirit/religion, traditional knowledge and traditional teachings. These medicines decrease the risk of STIs. Younger female participants explained how casual relationships are safer than committed monogamous relationships. Resolving abuse of power in relationships should lead to improvements in STI rates and sexual health. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: The impact of the prescription opioid public health crisis has been illustrated by the dramatic increase in opioid-related deaths in North America. We aimed to identify patterns and characteristics amongst opioid-users whose cause of death was related to opioid toxicity.
   Methods: This was a population-based study of Ontarians between the years 2006 and 2008. All drug-related deaths which occurred during this time frame were reviewed at the Office of the Chief Coroner of Ontario, and opioid-related deaths were identified. Medical, toxicology, pathology, and police reports were comprehensively reviewed. Narratives, semi-quantitative, and quantitative variables were extracted, tabulated, and analyzed.
   Results: Out of 2330 drug-related deaths in Ontario, 58% were attributed either in whole or in part, to opioids (n = 1359). Oxycodone was involved in approximately one-third of all opioid-related deaths. At least 7% of the entire cohort used opioids that were prescribed for friends and/or family, 19% inappropriately self-administered opioids (injection, inhalation, chewed patch), 3% were recently released from jail, and 5% had been switched from one opioid to another near the time of death. Accidental deaths were significantly associated with personal history of substance abuse, enrollment in methadone maintenance programs, cirrhosis, hepatitis, and cocaine use. Suicides were significantly associated with mental illness, previous suicide attempts, chronic pain, and a history of cancer.
   Significance/Conclusion: These results identify novel, susceptible groups of opioid-users whose cause of death was related to opioids in Ontario and provide the first evidence to assist in quantifying the contribution of opioid misuse and diversion amongst opioid-related mortality in Canada. Multifaceted prevention strategies need to be developed based on subpopulations of opioid users.

AB Background: College students are at increased risk for self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITB) and sexual risk behaviors (SRB). Although students with a history of SITB appear to be more prone to SRB, the mechanisms linking these risk behaviors remain largely unexplored. Previous research points to emotional control (EC), defined as one's awareness and adaptability of emotions, as a potential mechanism explaining the relationship between SITB and SRB.1
   Methods: Data included 722 college students attending two different universities in the northeast and southeast regions of the United States. Multiple group structural equation models were fit to estimate the direct and indirect effects of history of SITB (suicidal ideation, attempt, and nonsuicidal self-injury) and EC on SRB jointly across men and women.
   Results: Findings supported indirect relationships between SITB and SRB through dysregulated EC, with type of SITB and patterns of SRB differing between men and women. For women, history of suicidal ideation and nonsuicidal self-injury were indirectly related to increased SRB through dysregulated EC. For men, history of suicidal ideation showed an indirect relationship on SRB through EC.
   Limitations: Although this study employed random sampling,limitations include a cross-sectional design, which does not allow for causal inference, and reliance on self-report assessment data.
   Conclusions: College students with a history of SITB who experience dysregulated EC may be more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior. Clinicians working with college students should concomitantly consider suicide and self-injury with SRB and consider interventions to improve EC.

AB IntroductionInstead of the typical assessment of risk of illness in the offspring based on a parent with bipolar disorder, we explored the potential multigenerational conveyance across several disorders of the vulnerability to illness in the offspring of a patient with bipolar disorder.
   MethodsA total of 968 outpatients (average age 41 years) with bipolar illness gave informed consent and filled out a detailed questionnaire about a family history in their parents, grandparents, and offspring of: depression; bipolar disorder; alcohol abuse; substance abuse; suicide attempt; or other illness. Of those with children, 346 were from the USA and 132 were from Europe. Amount and type of illness in progenitors in two and three previous generations were related to offspring illness.
   ResultsThe type of illness seen in both prior generations was associated with the same type of illness in the offspring of a bipolar patient, including depression, bipolar disorder, alcohol and substance abuse and other illness, but not suicide attempts. There was an impact of multiple generations, such that depression in grandparents and/or great-grandparents increased the risk of depression in the offspring from 12.6% to 41.4%.
   ConclusionsA family history of illness burden in prior generations was previously related to an earlier age of onset of bipolar illness in our adult patients with bipolar disorder and is now also found to be related to the incidence of multiple psychiatric illnesses in their offspring. Genetic and epigenetic mechanisms deserve consideration for this multigenerational conveyance of illness vulnerability, and clinical and public health attempts to prevent or slow this transmission are indicated.

AB Objective: To determine attitudes among surgeons in Australia to assisted death, and the proportion of surgeons who have intentionally hastened death with or without an explicit request.
   Design: Anonymous, cross-sectional, mail-out survey between August and November 1999
   Participants. 683 out of 992 eligible general surgeons (68.9% response rate).
   Main outcome measures: Proportion of respondents answering affirmatively to questions about administering excessive doses of medication with an intention to hasten death.
   Results: 247 respondents (36.2%; 95% Cl, 32.6%-39.9%) reported that, for the purpose of relieving a patient's suffering, they have given drugs in doses that they perceived to be greater than those required to relieve symptoms with the intention of hastening death. More than half of these (139 respondents; 20.4% of all respondents; 95% Cl, 17.4%-23.6%) reported that they had never received an unambiguous request for a lethal dose of medication. Of all respondents, only 36 (5.3%; 95% Cl, 2.9%-6.1%) reported that they had given a bolus lethal injection, or had provided the means to commit suicide, in response to an unambiguous request.
   Conclusions. More than a third of surgeons surveyed reported giving drugs with an intention to hasten death, often in the absence of an explicit request. However, in many instances, this may involve the use of an infusion of analgesics or sedatives, and such actions may be difficult to distinguish from accepted palliative care, except on the basis of the doctor's self-reported intention. Legal and moral distinctions based solely on a doctor's intention are problematic.

AB The present study provides the first known qualitative examination of heterosexual undergraduate men's conceptualization and experiences of the bromance, outside research on cinematic representations. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 30 undergraduate men enrolled in one of four undergraduate sport-degree programs at one university in the United Kingdom, we find these heterosexual men to be less reliant on traditional homosocial boundaries, which have previously limited male same-sex friendships. Contrary to the repressive homosociality of the 1980s and 1990s, these men embrace a significantly more inclusive, tactile, and emotionally diverse approach to their homosocial relationships. All participants provided comparable definitions of what a bromance is and how it operates, all had at least one bromantic friend, and all suggested that bromances had more to offer than a standard friendship. Participants described a bromance as being more emotionally intimate, physically demonstrative, and based upon unrivalled trust and cohesion compared to their other friendships. Participants used their experiences with romances and familial relations as a reference point for considering the conditions of a bromance. Results support the view that declining homophobia and its internalization has had significantly positive implications for male expression and intimacy. Conclusions are made about the bromance's potential to improve men's mental health and social well-being because participants indicate these relationships provide a space for emotional disclosure and the discussion of potentially traumatic and sensitive issues.

AB The crude birth rate rose slightly in 2003 to 14.1 births per 1000 population, from 13.9 in 2002. The 2002 rate was the lowest ever reported for the United States. The total number of births and the fertility rate (66.1) also increased. The birth rate for teenaged mothers dropped 3% to another record low in 2003, to 41.7 per 1000 females aged 15 to 19 years. The teenage birth rate has fallen by one third since 1991. The birth rate declined for women 20 to 24 years old but rose for women aged 25 to 44 years. The number, rate, and proportion of births to unmarried women all increased in 2003.
   Smoking during pregnancy declined to 11%, down from 19.5% in 1989. Prenatal care utilization improved slightly for 2003; 84.1% of women began care in the first trimester of pregnancy. The cesarean delivery rate jumped 6% to 27.6% for another US high. The primary cesarean rate rose 6%, and the rate of vaginal birth after a previous cesarean delivery plummeted 16% from 2002 to 2003. The percent of infants delivered preterm continued to rise (12.3% in 2003). The preterm birth rate is up 16% since 1990. The percentage of children born at low birth weight rose slightly in 2003 to the highest level reported since 1970 (7.9%). The twinning rate increased, but the rate for triplet/+ births declined slightly between 2001 and 2002. Multiple births accounted for 3.3% of all births in 2002.
   The infant mortality rate rose to 7.0/1000 live births in 2002 from 6.8 in 2001, marking the first increase in this rate in >4 decades. Increases were distributed fairly widely across age, racial/ethnic groups, and geographic areas. The rise in infant mortality was attributed to increases in <750-g births in both singleton and multiple deliveries. Although the downward trend in infant mortality rates in many developed nations may have stabilized, the United States still ranked 27th among these nations in 2001.
   Expectation of life at birth reached a record high of 77.3 years for all gender and race groups combined in 2002. Death rates in the United States continue to decline. Between 2001 and 2002, death rates declined for the 3 leading causes of death: diseases of heart, malignant neoplasms, and cerebrovascular diseases. Death rates for children 1 to 19 years old decreased by 8% for suicide; the death rate for chronic lower respiratory diseases increased by 33% in 2002. Rates for unintentional injuries and homicide did not change significantly for children aged 1 to 19 years. A large proportion of childhood deaths continues to occur as a result of preventable injuries.

AB The Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 (MHCA) was a step that was essential, once the Government of India ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007. The MHCA looks to protect, promote, and fulfill the rights of persons with mental illness (PMI) as stated in the preamble of the Act. Further, there is an onus on the state to provide affordable mental health care to its citizens. In India, mental health has always been a lesser priority for lawmakers and citizens alike. The rights-based MHCA looks to overhaul the existing system by giving prominence to autonomy, protecting the rights of the mentally ill individuals, and making the State responsible for the care. The decision to make all this happen is commendable. The annual health expenditure of India is 1.15% of the gross domestic product, and the mental health budget is <1% of India's total health budget. This article systematically analyses and describes the cost estimation of the implementation of MHCA 2017, and it is not an estimation of mental health economics. The conservative annual estimated cost on the government to implement MHCA, 2017 would be 94,073 crore rupees. The present study estimation depicts that investing in the implementation of MHCA, 2017 by the government will yield 6.5 times the return on investment analysis benefit. If the State is not proactive in taking measures to implement the MHCA, the rights promised under this legislation will remain aspirational.

AB Hypothesis: Surgical residents and staff oncologists (surgical, medical, and radiation therapy) have similar opinions on participation in physician-assisted death for patients with terminal cancer.
   Design: Prospective survey.
   Setting: Tertiary care referral center.
   Participants: Residents undergoing surgical training (n=56) and faculty oncologists (n=24) of all specialties (surgical, medical, and radiation therapy).
   Main Outcome Measures: Subjects were queried regarding previous experience and willingness to participate (either directly or indirectly) in assisted death for terminal cancer patients.
   Results: Response rates were 39% (22 of 56) for the residents and 87% (21 of 24) for the oncologists. Of those who responded, 86% (19 of 22) of the residents would aid any of the hypothetical patients with assisted death, whereas only 19% (4 of 21) of the staff oncologists-expressed willingness to perform the same service. Furthermore, 32% (7 of 22) of the residents reported previous involvement in a case of assisted death from any disease, whereas only 19% (4 of 21) of the staff oncologists reported previous direct experience with assisted death in the terminal cancer patient.
   Conclusions: Surgical residents tend to have more experience with assisted death and are much more willing than staff oncologists to aid terminal cancer patients with this procedure. These opinions and practices are probably nor. the result of medical education but are developed from personal values.

ID GUN; LAWS
AB As recent cases of mass murder at Utoya Island in Norway, and in the United States (US) at Virginia Tech, Virginia; Tucson, Arizona; Aurora, Colorado; and Newtown, Connecticut all illustrate, acts of extreme violence involving high powered weapons and committed by persons with a presumed or confirmed mental illness tend to arouse intense public and political debates about the efficacy of firearm regulation and control. Following these tragedies, in the US at least, various law reform measures have been proposed and in some cases implemented designed principally to make it more difficult for mentally ill persons to gain access to firearms. In this article it is contended that measures like these are at best tinkering with the margins of gun control and also have the tendency to reinforce the stigma and discrimination experienced by persons with a mental illness, while perpetuating stereotypes of them as dangerous to themselves and others. Despite these limitations, and while firearm regulation policies and practices vary widely across the globe, most nations still seek in some way to limit access to guns by persons with a mental illness. This article explores in more detail how such policies and practices have been applied in the Australian State of New South Wales and the lessons to be learned elsewhere from this experience.

AB Objectives To investigate associations between Grade 9 and 10 cyber-bullying perpetration and victimization and Grade 11 problem behavior and mental health problems after controlling for risk factors for these outcomes in the analyses.
   Methods The sample comprised 927 students from Victoria, Australia who completed a modified version of the self-report Communities That Care Youth Survey in Grades 9-11 to report on risk factors, traditional and cyber-bullying perpetration and victimization, problem behavior, and mental health. Complete data on over 650 participants were analyzed.
   Results Five per cent of Grade 9 and 10 students reported cyber-bullying perpetration only, 6-8 % reported victimization only, and 8-9 % both cyber-bullied others and were cyber-bullied. Results showed that cyber-bullying others in Grade 10 was associated with theft in Grade 11, cyber-victimization in Grade 10 was linked with Grade 11 depressive symptoms, and Grade 10 cyber-bullying perpetration and victimization combined predicted Grade 11 school suspension and binge drinking.
   Conclusions Prevention approaches that target traditional and cyber-bullying, and established risk factors are necessary. Such multi-faceted programs may also reduce problem behavior and mental health problems.

AB Physician aid-in-dying (PAD) is now legalized in more than half a dozen states across the United States yet remains controversial among health care providers and the general public. Previous studies have described physicians' and nurses' experiences with and attitudes about PAD; however, there is no data about PAD in the context of genetic counseling. This study explores genetic counselors' experiences, understanding, training, and perspectives about PAD. Fifteen participants were recruited to complete semistructured telephone interviews. Five participants had received patient inquiries about PAD. Most participants (n=10) did not feel prepared to discuss PAD with patients and felt that they did not have adequate knowledge to answer patient questions about the practice. Participants described how the unique training, skills, and experiences of genetic counselors could be beneficial for discussing PAD with patients, in comparison to other providers. All participants supported training for genetic counselors about PAD, with many suggesting integration with education about palliative care and end-of-life planning. This is the first study to investigate PAD in the context of genetic counseling. Genetic counselors have had patients ask questions about PAD, want education and access to resources about PAD, and believe they can provide important support and guidance to patients considering PAD in some genetic counseling contexts.

AB Our paper aims to describe firearm-related behavior among American households and to quantify the influence of household characteristics on the probability of firearms possession and storage practices. Applying logistic regression techniques to data from the 2004 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS), we use separate models to estimate the effect of an array of respondent demographic characteristics factors on the likelihood that households will have a gun at home and, if so, whether they will keep it at either of two levels of risk. We find that rates of firearm ownership vary widely by household characteristics, including the state in which they reside. Simultaneously controlling for all of these factors scarcely diminishes variation in odds for ownership. Differences in the likelihood that owners will store guns unsafely are narrower and significant for fewer factors. Having children in the home scarcely affects the propensity to possess firearms but greatly reduces the chances a domestic firearm will be stored loaded and unsecured. Our findings support a consensus on the demographics of ownership but show more and stronger predictors of storage behavior than previous work. Differing dynamics of ownership and storage reveal the existence of two regional gun cultures. From these findings, we conclude that to mitigate mortality risks associated with guns in the home, encouraging safer storage by owners may be as effective as controlling sales. States and localities should test a range of promising but largely unproven interventions.

AB Objective: In 2006, the nonprofit organization Choose Responsibility called for repealing the 1984 National Minimum Drinking Age Act, which had led all 50 states to establish a minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) of 21 years, and allowing the states to lower their MLDA to 18 years. Two years later, the organization assembled a small group of college and university presidents (the Amethyst Initiative) to call publicly for a critical reexamination of the law. Public health and traffic safety experts responded to these efforts by generating new research on the age 21 MLDA, thus warranting an updated review of the literature. Method: This review focuses primarily on research published since 2006, when Choose Responsibility began its public relations campaign to lower the MLDA. Results: Recent research on the age 21 MLDA has reinforced the position that the current law has served the nation well by reducing alcohol-related traffic crashes and alcohol consumption among youths, while also protecting drinkers from long-term negative outcomes they might experience in adulthood, including alcohol and other drug dependence, adverse birth outcomes, and suicide and homicide. Conclusions: The age 21 law saves lives and is unlikely to be overturned. College and university leaders need to put into effect workable policies, stricter enforcement, and other evidence-based prevention efforts that have been demonstrated to reduce underage drinking and alcohol-related problems on campus and are being applied successfully at prominent academic institutions

AB Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning (LGBTQ) adolescents face well-documented health disparities in suicide risk, substance use, and sexual health. These disparities are known to stem, in part, from stigma directed toward LGBTQ youth in the form of minority stressors such as violence, discrimination, and harassment. Given the proportion of time that LGBTQ students spend in school, schools provide a critical context within which protective factors may be developed and leveraged to improve the health and well-being of these populations. This article provides a summary of key findings from a discussion among researchers, practitioners, and community members who participated in "The State of LGBTQ Youth Health and Wellbeing: Strengthening Schools and Families to Build Resilience," a public symposium held in June 2017. We detail emerging science on and future priorities for school-based research with LGBTQ youth which were identified by attendees at this meeting, with a particular focus on intersectionality, supportive adults in schools, and in-school programs. We call for more school-based research on priority gaps such as how LGBTQ students' intersecting identities affect their in-school experiences, how to design professional development programs that cultivate supportive educators, and how to leverage gay-straight alliances/gender and sexuality alliances as sites of health programming for LGBTQ students.

AB Intersectionality is a term used to describe the intersecting effects of race, class, gender, and other marginalizing characteristics that contribute to social identity and affect health. Adverse health effects are thought to occur via social processes including discrimination and structural inequalities (i.e., reduced opportunities for education and income). Although intersectionality has been well-described conceptually, approaches to modeling it in quantitative studies of health outcomes are still emerging. Strategies to date have focused on modeling demographic characteristics as proxies for structural inequality. Our objective was to extend these methodological efforts by modeling intersectionality across three levels: structural, contextual, and interpersonal, consistent with a social ecological framework. We conducted a secondary analysis of a database that included two components of a widely used survey instrument, the Everyday Discrimination Scale. We operationalized a meso- or interpersonal-level of intersectionality using two variables, the frequency score of discrimination experiences and the sum of characteristics listed as reasons for these (i.e., the person's race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, disability or pregnancy status, or physical appearance). We controlled for two structural inequality factors (low education, poverty) and three contextual factors (high crime neighborhood, racial minority status, and trauma exposures). The outcome variables we modeled were posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and a quality of life index score. We used data from 619 women who completed the Everyday Discrimination Scale for a perinatal study in the U.S. state of Michigan. Statistical results indicated that the two interpersonal-level variables (i.e., number of marginalized identities, frequency of discrimination) explained 15% of variance in posttraumatic stress symptoms and 13% of variance in quality of life scores, improving the predictive value of the models over those using structural inequality and contextual factors alone. This study's results point to instrument development ideas to improve the statistical modeling of intersectionality in health and social science research. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Context: Temporal trends in disparities in the leading causes of death within and between US demographic subgroups indicate the need for and success of interventions to prevent premature death in vulnerable populations. Studies that report recent trends are limited and outdated. Objective: To describe temporal trends in disparities in death rates by sex and race/ethnicity for the 10 leading causes of death in the United States during 1999-2010. Design: We used underlying cause of death data and population estimates from the National Vital Statistics System to calculate age-adjusted death rates for the 10 leading causes of death during 1999-2010. We measured absolute and relative disparities by sex and race/ethnicity for each cause and year of death; we used weighted linear regression to test for significance of trends over time. Results: Of the 10 leading causes of death, age-adjusted death rates by sex and race/ethnicity declined during 1999-2010 for 6 causes and increased for 4 causes. But sex and racial/ethnic disparities between groups persisted for each year and cause of death. In the US population, the decreasing trend during 1999-2010 was greatest for cerebrovascular disease (-36.5%) and the increasing trend was greatest for Alzheimer disease (52.4%). For each sex and year, the disparity in death rates between Asian/Pacific Islanders (API) and other groups varied significantly by cause of death. In 2010, the API-non-Hispanic black disparity was largest for heart disease, malignant neoplasms, cerebrovascular diseases, and nephritis; the API-American Indian/Alaska Native disparity was largest for unintentional injury, diabetes mellitus, influenza and pneumonia, and suicide; and the API-non-Hispanic white disparity was largest for chronic lower respiratory diseases and Alzheimer disease. Conclusions: Public health practitioners can use these findings to improve policies and practices and to evaluate progress in eliminating disparities and their social determinants in vulnerable populations.

AB Objectives: In this 6-month open-label extension (OLE) of NCT01491035 (a 14-day, open-label, pharmacokinetic/safety lead-in study), the long-term safety and tolerability of vortioxetine (5-20mg/day) were investigated in children and adolescents with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of depressive or anxiety disorder in the United States or Germany. The study also was designed to provide data to inform dose selection and titration in future pediatric studies with vortioxetine. Methods: Safety evaluations included spontaneously reported adverse events (AEs), the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), and the Pediatric Adverse Events Rating Scale (PAERS; clinician administered). Clinical effectiveness was determined by Clinical Global Impressions. Comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was permitted, including concomitant use of stimulant medication (US sites only). Results: Of the 47 patients who completed the lead-in period, 41 continued into the OLE. Most patients (n=39 [95%]) continued their previous dose regimen. Twenty-one patients (51%) withdrew during the OLE; the most common primary reasons were administrative [n=8], AEs [n=4], and lack of efficacy [n=3]. Thirty-five patients (85%) had 1 AE, 86% of which were mild or moderate in severity. Five patients (12%) reported a severe AE, none of which was considered related to study medication. The most common AEs (10%) were headache (27%), nausea (20%), dysmenorrhea (females; 19%), and vomiting (15%), with no relationship between AE intensity and age or dose. Five patients reported instances of suicidal ideation during the OLE, one of whom also reported this during the lead-in period. Two patients had nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior; one had a nonfatal suicide attempt. Throughout the study, there was a decrease over time in the incidence and intensity of AEs collected using the PAERS. Effectiveness assessment indicated a trend toward improvement based on numeric results. Conclusion: This OLE confirms the findings from the lead-in study, which concluded that a dosing strategy of 5-20mg/day is safe, well tolerated, and suitable for future clinical studies of vortioxetine in pediatric patients.

AB Objective: To describe prevalence and correlates of suicidal behaviour in the New Zealand population aged 16 years and over.
   Method: Data are from Te Rau Hinengaro: The New Zealand Mental Health Survey, a nationally representative household survey conducted from October 2003 to December 2004 in a sample of 12 992 participants aged 16 years and over to study prevalences and correlates of mental disorders assessed using the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Lifetime and 12 month prevalences and onset distributions for suicidal ideation, plans and attempts, and sociodemographic and mental disorder correlates of these behaviours were examined.
   Results: Lifetime prevalences were 15.7% for suicidal ideation, 5.5% for suicide plan and 4.5% for suicide attempt, and were consistently significantly higher in females than in males. Twelve-month prevalences were 3.2% for ideation, 1.0% for plan and 0.4% for attempt. Risk of ideation in the past 12 months was higher in females, younger people, people with lower educational qualifications, and people with low household income. Risk of making a plan or attempt was higher in younger people and in people with low household income. After adjustment for sociodemographic factors, there were no ethnic differences in ideation, although Maori and Pacific people had elevated risks of plans and attempts compared with non-Maori non-Pacific people. Individuals with a mental disorder had elevated risks of ideation (11.8%), plan (4.1%) and attempt (1.6%) compared with those without mental disorder. Risks of suicidal ideation, plan and attempt were associated with mood disorder, substance use disorder and anxiety disorder. Major depression was the specific disorder most strongly associated with suicidal ideation, plan and attempt. Less than half of those who reported suicidal behaviours within the past 12 months had made visits to health professionals within that period. Less than one-third of those who had made attempts had received treatment from a psychiatrist.
   Conclusions: Risks of making a suicide plan or attempt were associated with mental disorder and sociodemographic disadvantage. Most people with suicidal behaviours had not seen a health professional for mental health problems during the time that they were suicidal.

AB IMPORTANCE Previous studies have shown an inverse association between offspring religiosity and suicidal ideation/attempts, but the association of parent religiosity on offspring suicidal ideation/attempts has not been examined.
   OBJECTIVE To examine associations of parent and offspring religiosity with suicide ideation and attempts in offspring.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The study is based on offspring (generation 3) from a 3-generation family study at New York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia University, in which generations 2 and 3 were defined as being at high risk or low risk for major depressive disorder because of the presence or absence of major depressive disorder in generation 1. The association between suicidal behaviors (ideation/attempts) and parent and offspring religiosity in generation 3 offspring aged 6 to 18 years (214 offspring from 112 nuclear families) was examined.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Parents' psychiatric diagnoses and suicidal behaviors were assessed with the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, and offspring were independently assessed using the child version. Two measures of religiosity were assessed: religious importance and religious attendance. Logistic regressions in the framework of generalized estimation equations were performed to analyze offspring suicidal behaviors while adjusting for sibling correlation and offspring age, sex, and familial depression risk status.
   RESULTS Of 214 offspring, 112 (52.3%) were girls. Offspring religious importance was associated with a lower risk for suicidal behavior in girls (odds ratio [OR], 0.48; 95% CI, 0.33-0.70) but not in boys (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.74-1.80) (religiosity by sex interaction, P = .05). Religious attendance was associated with a lower risk for suicidal behavior in girls (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49-0.84) but not boys (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.69-1.27) (religiosity by sex interaction, P = .17). Parent religious importance was associated with a lower risk for offspring suicidal behavior (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.41-0.91) but not parent religious attendance. When parent and offspring religious importance were considered simultaneously, we found a lower risk associated with parental religious importance (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.39-0.96) independent of offspring importance. These associations were independent of parental depression, marital status, and parental suicide ideation.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, parental belief in religious importance was associated with lower risk for suicidal behavior in offspring independent of an offspring's own belief about religious importance and other known parental factors, such as parental depression, suicidal behavior, and divorce.

AB Objective: Existing studies report contradictory findings regarding characteristics and outcomes of patients admitted with self-inflicted burn injuries. The objective of this study was to report demographic and medical characteristics of patients admitted to burn centers with self-inflicted burn injuries and to assess mortality risk and length of stay compared with patients whose injuries were not self-inflicted.
   Design: Retrospective, cohort study.
   Setting. A total of 70 burn centers from the United States that contributed data to the American Burn Association National Burn Repository.
   Patients. A total of 30,382 adult patients (593 with self-inflicted injuries) who were admitted with a thermal injury from 1995 through 2005.
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and Main Results: Demographics, comorbidities, burn injury severity variables (total body surface area burned [TBSA], TBSA burned third degree, inhalation injury), hospital mortality, intensive care length of stay, and total hospital length of stay were ascertained. Patients with self-inflicted injuries had larger TBSA burned (32.0% vs. 12.8%, p < .01) and larger third-degree TBSA burned (20.6% vs. 4.9%, p < .01) and were more likely to incur an inhalation injury (37.3% vs. 12.8%, p < .01). Before matching, patients with self-inflicted injuries were at greater risk of mortality (23.6% vs. 6.8%, p < .01) and required longer intensive care (median of 4 days vs. 0 days, p < .01) and total hospital stays (median of 23 days vs. 8 days, p < .01). After propensity score matching on demographic, medical, and burn injury variables, they were not more likely to die of their injuries (23.6% vs. 23.1%, p = .84), did not require longer intensive care stays (4 days vs. 3 days, p = .75), and did not require longer total hospital stays (23 days vs. 18 days, p = .50).
   Conclusions., Compared with patients with similar demographic, health, and injury characteristics whose injuries are not self-inflicted, patients with self-inflicted burn injuries are not at greater risk of mortality and do not require longer durations of intensive care or total hospitalization.

AB IMPORTANCE Longer-term mortality in individuals who have survived a traumatic brain injury (TBI) is not known.
   OBJECTIVES To examine the relationship between TBI and premature mortality, particularly by external causes, and determine the role of psychiatric comorbidity.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS We studied all persons born in 1954 or later in Sweden who received inpatient and outpatient International Classification of Diseases-based diagnoses of TBI from 1969 to 2009 (n = 218 300). We compared mortality rates 6 months or more after TBI to general population controls matched on age and sex (n = 2 163 190) and to unaffected siblings of patients with TBI (n = 150 513). Furthermore, we specifically examined external causes of death (suicide, injury, or assault). We conducted sensitivity analyses to investigate whether mortality rates differed by sex, age at death, severity (including concussion), and different follow-up times after diagnosis.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of premature death by external causes in patients with TBI compared with general population controls.
   RESULTS Among those who survived 6 months after TBI, we found a 3-fold increased odds of mortality (AOR, 3.2; 95% CI, 3.0-3.4) compared with general population controls and an adjusted increased odds of mortality of 2.6 (95% CI, 2.3-2.8) compared with unaffected siblings. Risks of mortality from external causes were elevated, including for suicide (AOR, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.9-3.7), injuries (AOR, 4.3; 95% CI, 3.8-4.8), and assault (AOR, 3.9; 95% CI, 2.7-5.7). Among those with TBI, absolute rates of death were high in those with any psychiatric or substance abuse comorbidity (3.8% died prematurely) and those with solely substance abuse (6.2%) compared with those without comorbidity (0.5%).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Traumatic brain injury is associated with substantially elevated risks of premature mortality, particularly for suicide, injuries, and assaults, even after adjustment for sociodemographic and familial factors. Current clinical guidelines may need revision to reduce mortality risks beyond the first few months after injury and address high rates of psychiatric comorbidity and substance abuse.

AB The suicide rate for females in China is the second highest worldwide, and China is the only country in the world in which the rate of suicides is higher for women than men. Affective instability has been shown to be a strong predictor of suicidal ideation, particularly among women. However, prior research has mainly focused on the impact of women's negative affect on suicidal ideation, ignoring the influence of positive affect on suicidal ideation. Studies have revealed that hopelessness, which is 1.3 times more important than depression for explaining suicidal ideation, is driven more by low levels of positive affect than by high levels of negative affect. Although positive affect has also been found to be related to suicidal ideation, and it demonstrates independent, beneficial effects on mental health, much remains to be learned about the association between positive affective instability and suicidal ideation. Therefore, we investigated the prevalence of suicidal ideation among Chinese working women and explored the differences between working women with and without suicidal ideation in the intensity and daily variability of positive affect. A total of 222 young working women of ages 22-36 years (M = 27.64, SD = 3.73) were recruited from a free weekend psychology lecture. The women subsequently completed a daily diary Day Reconstruction Method (DRM) as well as a suicidal ideation questionnaire. We used hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to analyze the data, and the results showed that: (1) 10.81% of participates reported suicidal ideation, the intensity of positive affect (happiness, warmth/friendliness, interest and relaxation/calmness) was significantly lower for women with suicidal ideation compared to women without suicidal ideation; (2) differing diurnal patterns of positive emotions were observed between women with and without suicidal ideation; women with suicidal ideation demonstrated a significantly lower trend of growth and a higher volatility in happiness, warmth/friendliness, relaxation/calmness. Given that lower intensity of positive affect and greater affective instability significantly predicted suicidal ideation in Chinese women, researchers should pay more attention to the role of positive affect in female suicide prevention research and intervention efforts in the future.

AB Background: Previous studies have found that suicide rates are likely to increase after the occurrence of earthquakes. Most existing studies that examined the relationship between PTSD and suicidally focus on risk factors. It remains unclear whether protective factors, such as post-traumatic growth (PTG) and social support, play a role in this relationship.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of PTG and social support in the association between PTSD and suicidally, using data from a cross-sectional study conducted in China.
   Methods: 1,369 participants were recruited from two study sites that were severely affected by the Wenchuan earthquake. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between PTSD, PTG, social support, and suicidally.
   Results: The results indicate that the prevalence of suicidal ideation, suicide plans, and suicide attempts among adult survivors were 9.06%, 2.97% and 3.31%, respectively, even after 8 years following the Wenchuan earthquake. Furthermore, the findings show that PTSD was significantly associated with suicidally (OR = 1.96; 95% CI = 1.53, 2.52). Additionally, individuals reporting lower levels of social support and the acquisition of PTSD (OR = 5.99; 95% CI = 1.66, 21.56) were significantly related to suicidally. Moreover, compared to individuals who reported no presence of PTSD and high PTG, those who lived with PTSD and lower levels of PTG (OR = 2.33; 95%CI = 1.00, 5.42) were more likely to report suicidally.
   Limitations: The cross-sectional design of this study limits our ability to determine causal relationships. Effects of other related factors, such as cultural and life events, were not examined in this study.
   Conclusions: Suicidally is a long-term health issue among survivors of the Wenchuan earthquake. PTG and social support play important roles on the association between PTSD and suicidally and are important contributing factors to understanding this relationship. These results contribute new knowledge of suicidal risk for a number of years after an earthquake and have implications for further mental health promotion following earthquakes.

AB Background: Latent class analysis (LCA) offers a parsimonious way of classifying common typologies of psychiatric comorbidity. We used LCA to identify the nature and correlates of predominant typologies of Axis I and II disorders in a large and comprehensive population-based sample of U.S. adults.
   Methods: We analyzed data from Wave 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (2004-2005; n = 34,653), a population-based sample of U.S. adults. We derived latent classes based on all assessed Axis land II disorders and examined the relationship between the identified Axis I classes and lifetime psychiatric disorders and suicide attempts, and physical and mental health-related quality of life.
   Results: A four-class solution was optimal in characterizing predominant typologies of both Axis I and II disorders. For Axis I disorders, these included low psychopathology (n = 28,935, 84.0%), internalizing (n = 3693, 9.9%), externalizing (n = 1426, 4.5%), and high psychopathology (n = 599, 1.6%) classes. For Axis II disorders, these included no/low personality disorders (n = 31,265, 90.9%), obsessive/paranoid (n = 1635, 4.6%), borderline/dysregulated (n = 1319, 3.4%), and highly comorbid (n = 434, 1.1%) classes. Compared to the low psychopathology class, all other Axis I classes had significantly increased odds of mental disorders, elevated Axis II classes, suicide attempts and poorer quality of life, with the high psychopathology class having the overall highest rates of these correlates, with the exception of substance use disorders. Compared to the low psychopathology class, the internalizing and externalizing classes had increased rates of mood and anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders, respectively.
   Conclusion: Axis I and II psychopathology among U.S. adults may be best represented by four predominant typologies. Characterizing co-occurring patterns of psychopathology using person-based typologies represents a higher-order classification system that may be useful in clinical and research settings.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the frequency and nature of mental health problems and symptoms among a group of 51 inner-city male adolescents attending a teen health clinic at a large county hospital in the southwestern part of the United States. They were administered a problem area checklist and a problem symptom checklist. The problem area checklist covered a range of mental health issues, including peer/friendship, relationship, and family problems; problems with money, time, and the law; substance use; and eating disorders. The problem symptom checklist queried participants about anger, nervousness, depression, fear, loneliness, suicide, aggression, and self-esteem. The results indicated that these young males experienced significant mental health problems and symptoms, such as relationship problems, problems with time and money, and symptoms of anger, depression, and aggression. Further, scared/afraid feelings correlated with five of the eight problem areas. The authors recommend investigating ways to target young males who present at such clinics in order to address their mental health problems and symptoms, as well as studying how their environment affects their overall health.

TI Pregnancy-associated deaths - A 15-year retrospective study and overall
   review of maternal pathophysiology
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FORENSIC MEDICINE AND PATHOLOGY
LA English
DT Review
DE autopsy; maternal; mortality; pregnancy; death
ID MORTALITY; DELIVERY
AB Pregnancy-related death is defined by the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) as the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the cause of death. In the year 2000, a collaborative effort involving World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, and UNFPA estimated 660 maternal deaths in the United States. This averages I I maternal deaths per 100,000 live births reported. Many pregnancy-associated deaths are not easily identified as such since the presence of a recent or current pregnancy may not be listed on the death certificate. Thus, the WHO estimates that in the United States, the maternal mortality is approximately 17/100,000 pregnancies. This is significantly higher than the goal set by the US Department of Health and Human Services in Healthy People 2010, which sets the target for maternal mortality at less than 3.3/100,000 live births. The most common causes of maternal death vary somewhat from region to region in the United States. They include pulmonary thromboembolism, amniotic fluid embolism, primary postpartum uterine hemorrhage, infection, and complications of hypertension including preeclampsia and eclampsia. Pulmonary disease, complications of anesthesia, and cardiomyopathy also are significant contributors to maternal mortality in some populations.
   The death of a pregnant or recently pregnant individual poses a wide scope of challenges to the forensic pathologist and investigator. The pathologist must have a broad knowledge of the physiologic and biochemical changes that occur during pregnancy, as well as the clinical and pathological manifestation of these changes. Conditions that may be "benign" in the nonpregnant individual may be lethal in the puerperal period. In addition, it should be kept in mind that deaths during pregnancy may be due to unnatural causes. Accident, homicide, and suicide must be ruled out in each case.
   The authors reviewed all forensic cases referred for autopsy to the Forensic Section of the Medical University of South Carolina from January 1989 through December 2003. All decedents listed as pregnant or postpartum were analyzed as to maternal age, race, past medical history, previous pregnancies and outcome, prenatal care, gestational age, fetal or neonatal outcome, location of delivery, placental findings, maternal autopsy findings, toxicology, cause of death, manner of death, and fetal or neonatal autopsy findings. The authors present this retrospective study to better determine the factors leading to maternal demise and discuss the autopsy/ancillary techniques useful in determining the cause of death in this challenging area.

AB Objective: The surgical margin status after breast-conserving surgery is considered the strongest predictor for local failure. The purpose of this study is to survey how radiation oncologists in North America (NA) and Europe define negative or close surgical margins after lumpectomy and to determine the factors that govern the decision to recommend reexcision based on the margins status.
   Methods: A questionnaire was sent to active members of the European Society of Therapeutic Radiation Oncology and the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology who had completed training in radiation oncology. Respondents were asked whether they would characterize margins to be negative or close for a variety of scenarios. A second survey was sent to 500 randomly selected radiation oncologists in the United States to assess when a reexcision would be recommended based on surgical margins.
   Results: A total of 702 responses were obtained from NA and 431 from Europe to the initial survey. An additional 130 responses were obtained from the United States to the second survey regarding reexcision recommendations. Nearly 46% of the North American respondents required only that there be "no tumor cells on the ink" to deem a margin negative (National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project definition). A total of 7.4% and 21.8% required no tumor cells seen at < 1 mm and < 2 mm, respectively. The corresponding numbers from European respondents were 27.6%, 11.2%, and 8.8%, respectively (P < 0.001). Europeans more frequently required a larger distance (> 5 mm) between tumor cells and the inked edges before considering a margin to be negative.
   Conclusion: This study revealed significant variation in the perception of negative and close margins among radiation oncologists in NA and Europe. Given these findings, a universal definition of negative margins and consistent recommendations for reexcision are needed.

AB BackgroundWe describe the background, rationale, intervention components, and formative results of a demonstration project aimed to ameliorate five socio-structural barriers to HIV services for young Black men aged 18-29 living with and at risk for HIV in Louisiana.MethodsThe interventions and activities consisted of (1) five person-centered approaches to enhance linkage to HIV services and improve socio-economic outcomes; (2) the implementation of systematic mystery shopping tests to document instances of housing discrimination; (3) the development and implementation of a multi-prong communications campaign to increase knowledge about the signs of housing discrimination and community resources among young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM); (4) the integration of HIV/STI services and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans (LGBT)-inclusive events on Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs); and (5) the development of a safe spacefor YBMSM. A multi-method approach was used to evaluate the outcomes of the different interventions.ResultsThe majority (62%) of participants living with HIV were linked to HIV care and 49% had achieved viral suppression. More than 40% of participants were employed during the project. Thirty-seven percent(37%) of the mystery shopping tests showed definite or possible signs of housing discrimination. The housing campaign's duration was limited with unknown long-term impact among YBMSM. Fifteen cases of syphilis were identified during two HBCU events. A safe space was specifically created for YBMSM at a community-based organization.ConclusionMulti-component holistic health interventions are needed to improve HIV outcomes and curb the high HIV rates among young Black men, particularly YBMSM in the United States and the Deep South.

TI Causes of Death among Commercially Insured Multiple Sclerosis Patients
   in the United States
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SURVIVAL; MORTALITY
AB Background: Information on causes of death (CODs) for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States is sparse and limited by standard categorizations of underlying and immediate CODs on death certificates. Prior research indicated that excess mortality among MS patients was largely due to greater mortality from infectious, cardiovascular, or pulmonary causes.
   Objective: To analyze disease categories in order to gain insight to pathways, which lead directly to death in MS patients.
   Methods: Commercially insured MS patients enrolled in the OptumInsight Research database between 1996 and 2009 were matched to non-MS comparators on age/residence at index year and sex. The cause most-directly leading to death from the death certificate, referred to as the "principal'' COD, was determined using an algorithm to minimize the selection of either MS or cardiac/pulmonary arrest as the COD. Principal CODs were categorized into MS, cancer, cardiovascular, infectious, suicide, accidental, pulmonary, other, or unknown. Infectious, cardiovascular, and pulmonary CODs were further subcategorized.
   Results: 30,402 MS patients were matched to 89,818 controls, with mortality rates of 899 and 446 deaths/100,000 person-years, respectively. Excluding MS, differences in mortality rate between MS patients and non-MS comparators were largely attributable to infections, cardiovascular causes, and pulmonary problems. Of the 95 excessive deaths (per 100,000 person-years) related to infectious causes, 41 (43.2%) were due to pulmonary infections and 45 (47.4%) were attributed to sepsis. Of the 46 excessive deaths (per 100,000 person-years) related to pulmonary causes, 27 (58.7%) were due to aspiration. No single diagnostic entity predominated for the 60 excessive deaths (per 100,000 person-years) attributable to cardiac CODs.
   Conclusions: The principal COD algorithm improved on other methods of determining COD in MS patients from death certificates. A greater awareness of the common CODs in MS patients will allow physicians to anticipate potential problems and, thereby, improve the care that they provide.

AB Objective: To compare occurrence of clinically diagnosed psychiatric disorders and suicidal behavior (mental health disorders) across dementia subtypes in the largest healthcare system in the United States. Methods: We aggregated two national databases (Department of Veterans Affairs [VA] National Patient Care Database, National Suicide Prevention Applications Network [SPAN]) and estimated 2-year prevalence of mental health disorders across five dementia subtypes during fiscal years 2012 2013. Using VA healthcare systems throughout the United States, the sample included 56,296 older patients ( 50 years) with Alzheimer's disease (AD; n = 30,578), vascular dementia (VD; n = 17,924), frontotemporal dementia (FTD; n = 1,181), Lewy body dementia (LBD; n = 3,194), and mixed dementia (MD; n = 3,419). Mental health disorders were determined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes and the National SPAN. Results: Roughly 25% of patients had at least one mental health disorder, with 2-year prevalence reaching 30%-45% in FTD, VD, LBD, and MD. Compared with other subtypes, patients with FTD had the highest prevalence of mood (19%), anxiety (20%), and substance use (19%) disorders, as well as suicidal behavior (4%), with nearly 0.5% with a suicidal plan/attempt. Those with VD also showed a high prevalence of these disorders (14%-17%). Although patients with LBD and MD had a slightly lower prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders (12%-15%), they had a much lower prevalence of substance use disorders (9%) and suicidal behavior (2%). Patients with AD had the lowest 2-year prevalence of all mental health disorders (<7%). Conclusion: Occurrence of mental health disorders is high and differs across dementia subtypes, highlighting the importance of reducing the burden of mental health disorders in dementia subtypes.

TI Specialty and sex as predictors of depression in dentists

   CARE
AB Background. Stress, burnout, substance abuse and suicide among dentists have been studied, yet no study in the United States has specifically addressed depression in dentists. The objective of the authors' study was to determine if sex and dental specialty were correlated with depression in dentists.
   Methods. The authors conducted a survey of a sample of dentists chosen randomly from the American Dental Associations mailing list of member dentists. The survey, stratified by sex and specialty, resulted in 560 responses, for a 53 percent response rate. The authors used the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale to measure depression. The authors examined, the respondents' sex, age, number of children, marital status, specialty, practice type, location of practice, years in practice and hours worked per week
   Results. The rate of depression in the overall sample was 9 percent. Sex was associated with depression (P < .001), but specialty was not. However, multiple regression analysis found that sex was significantly related to depression in only two specialties: periodontics and pediatric dentistry. Overall, the regression model explained an unimpressive 6 percent of the variance in depression scores. The most important finding of the study was that only 15 percent of depressed dentists were receiving treatment.
   Conclusions. The survey results showed that only fen ale pediatric dentists and periodontists were more depressed than their male counterparts. None of the other variables studied contributed significantly to the understanding of depression in dentists. Depressed dentists, like other depressed people, tend not to seek treatment.
   Clinical Implications. Depression and i serious depression occur among dentists, and much of it is untreated. Because depression is harmful to dentists and raises quality-of-care issues, they should be educated to help them recognize depression and encouraged to seek treatment.

   ANALYSIS; HANGING INJURIES; COMATOSE SURVIVORS; DEATHS; OUTCOMES;
   STRANGULATION; MULTICENTER; COMORBIDITY
AB Introduction: Asphyxiation or suffocation injuries can result in multi-organ damage and are a major cause of morbidity and mortality among different age groups. This study aims to describe characteristics of patients presenting with suffocation injuries to emergency departments (EDs) in the United States (U.S.) and to identify factors associated with mortality in this population.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study using the 2013 U.S National Emergency Department Sample database. ED visits with primary diagnoses of intentional or accidental suffocation injury, and injury by inhalation and aspiration of foreign bodies or food (ICD-9-CM codes) were included. We performed descriptive statistics to describe the study population. This was followed by multivariate analyses to identify factors associated with mortality.
   Results: We included a total of 27,381 ED visits for suffocation injuries. Most suffered from either inhalation and ingestion of food causing obstruction of respiratory tract or suffocation (51.6%), or suicide and self-inflicted injury by hanging, strangulation, and suffocation (39.4%). Overall mortality was 10.9%. Over half (54.7%) of the patients were between 19 and 65 years old. Males were more common than females (59.1% vs. 40.9%). Over half of the patients (54.9%) were treated and released from the ED. Factors associated with increased mortality included male gender, young age (4-18 years), diseases of the cardiac, respiratory, genitourinary and neurologic systems, intentional self-harm, and self-payer status.
   Conclusion: Mortality from suffocation injuries remains high with significant burden on children and adolescents and on patients with intentional injuries. Tailored initiatives targeting identified modifiable factors through implementation of behavioral and environmental change can reduce the risk of suffocation injury and improve clinical outcomes of affected victims.

TI Characteristics associated with negative attitudes toward mental illness
   among US veterinarians
SO JAVMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES VETERINARIANS; RISK-FACTORS; SUICIDE; HEALTH; PREVALENCE;
   CANCER; DEATH
AB OBJECTIVE
   To explore associations between demographic, occupational, and mental health characteristics and negative attitudes toward mental illness among veterinarians.
   DESIGN
   Cross-sectional survey.
   SAMPLE
   9,522 veterinarians employed in the United States.
   PROCEDURES
   Data from a previously conducted voluntary, anonymous, web-based survey were used. Negative attitude was defined as slight or strong disagreement with 2 statements: "Treatment can help people with mental illness lead normal lives" (treatment effectiveness) and "People are generally caring and sympathetic to people with mental illness" (social support). Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify variables associated with negative attitudes.
   RESULTS
   Of the 9,522 respondents, 6,585 (69.2%) were female, 4,523 (47.5%) were 40 to 59 years old, 291 (3.1%) had a negative attitude toward treatment effectiveness, and 4,504 (47.3%) had a negative attitude toward social support. After adjusting for other variables, negative attitude toward treatment effectiveness was significantly more likely in males, those with 10 to 19 (vs 1 to 9) years of practice experience, solo practitioners, those in government (vs "other") practice, those with evidence of serious psychological distress, and those reporting suicidal ideation after veterinary school and significantly less likely in those receiving mental health treatment. A negative attitude toward social support was significantly less likely in males and significantly more likely in 40 to 59 (vs 20 to 39) year olds, childless respondents, solo practitioners, those without membership in a veterinary association, those with evidence of serious psychological distress, those reporting depression during or after veterinary school, and those reporting suicidal ideation after veterinary school.
   CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE
   Characteristics such as age, sex, practice setting, and mental illness history might be useful to consider when targeting interventions to support and educate veterinarians about mental illness.

AB IMPORTANCE Examining causes of death and making comparisons across countries may increase understanding of the income-related differences in life expectancy.
   OBJECTIVES To describe income-related differences in life expectancy and causes of death in Norway and to compare those differences with US estimates.
   DESIGN AND SETTING A registry-based study including all Norwegian residents aged at least 40 years from 2005 to 2015.
   EXPOSURES Household income adjusted for household size.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Life expectancy at 40 years of age and cause-specific mortality.
   RESULTS In total, 3 041 828 persons contributed 25 805 277 person-years and 441 768 deaths during the study period (mean [SD] age, 59.3 years [13.6]; mean [SD] number of household members per person, 2.5 [1.3]). Life expectancy was highest for women with income in the top 1% (86.4 years [95% CI, 85.7-87.1]) which was 8.4 years (95% CI, 7.2-9.6) longer than women with income in the lowest 1%. Men with the lowest 1% income had the lowest life expectancy (70.6 years [95% CI, 69.6-71.6]), which was 13.8 years (95% CI, 12.3-15.2) less than men with the top 1% income. From 2005 to 2015, the differences in life expectancy by income increased, largely attributable to deaths from cardiovascular disease, cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and dementia in older age groups and substance use deaths and suicides in younger age groups. Over the same period, life expectancy for women in the highest income quartile increased 3.2 years (95% CI, 2.7-3.7), while life expectancy for women in the lowest income quartile decreased 0.4 years (95% CI, -1.0 to 0.2). For men, life expectancy increased 3.1 years (95% CI, 2.5-3.7) in the highest income quartile and 0.9 years (95% CI, 0.2-1.6) in the lowest income quartile. Differences in life expectancy by income levels in Norway were similar to differences observed in the United States, except that life expectancy was higher in Norway in the lower to middle part of the income distribution in both men and women.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In Norway, there were substantial and increasing gaps in life expectancy by income level from 2005 to 2015. The largest differences in life expectancy between Norway and United States were for individuals in the lower to middle part of the income distribution.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the mortality risks, over 20 years of follow-up in a nationally representative sample, associated with illegal drug use and to describe risk factors for mortality.
   Methods: We analyzed data from the 1991 National Health Interview Survey, which is a nationally representative household survey in the United States, linked to the National Death Index through 2011. This study included 20,498 adults, aged 18-44 years in 1991, with 1047 subsequent deaths. A composite variable of self-reported lifetime illegal drug use was created (hierarchical categories of heroin, cocaine, hallucinogens/inhalants, and marijuana use).
   Results: Mortality risk was significantly elevated among individuals who reported lifetime use of heroin (HR = 2.40, 95% CI: 1.65-3.48) and cocaine (HR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.04-1.55), but not for those who used hallucinogens/inhalants or marijuana, when adjusting for demographic characteristics. Baseline health risk factors (smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, and BMI) explained the greatest amount of this mortality risk. After adjusting for all baseline covariates, the association between heroin or cocaine use and mortality approached significance. In models adjusted for demographics, people who reported lifetime use of heroin or cocaine had an elevated mortality risk due to external causes (poisoning, suicide, homicide, and unintentional injury). People who had used heroin, cocaine, or hallucinogens/inhalants had an elevated mortality risk due to infectious diseases.
   Conclusions: Heroin and cocaine are associated with considerable excess mortality, particularly due to external causes and infectious diseases. This association can be explained mainly by health risk behaviors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: No representative population-based studies of youth in the United States exist on gender identity-related disparities in suicidal ideation or on factors that underlie this disparity. To address this, this study examined gender identity-related disparities in the prevalence of suicidal ideation; evaluated whether established psychosocial factors explained these disparities; and identified correlates of suicidal ideation among all youth and stratified by gender identity.
   Method: Data were derived from the 2013 to 2015 California Healthy Kids Survey (CHKS; N = 621,189) and a weighted subsample representative of the Californian student population (Biennial Statewide California Student Survey [CSS], N = 28,856).
   Results: Prevalence of past 12-month self-reported suicidal ideation was nearly twice as high for transgender compared with non-transgender youth (33.73% versus 18.85%; chi(2) = 35.48, p < .001). In fully adjusted models within the representative sample, transgender youth had 2.99 higher odds (95% CI 2.25-3.98) of reporting past-year suicidal ideation compared with non-transgender youth. Among transgender youth, only depressive symptoms (adjusted odds ratio 5.44, 95% CI 1.81-16.38) and victimization (adjusted odds ratio 2.66, 95% CI 1.26-5.65) remained significantly associated with higher odds of suicidal ideation in fully adjusted models. In multiple mediation analyses, depression attenuated the association between gender identity and suicidal ideation by 17.95% and victimization by 14.71%.
   Conclusion: This study uses the first representative population-based sample of youth in the United States that includes a measurement of gender identity to report on gender identity-related disparities in suicidal ideation and to identify potential mechanisms underlying this disparity in a representative sample.

TI Connection, meaning, and distraction: A qualitative study of video game
   play and mental health recovery in veterans treated for mental and/or

AB Rationale: Mental and behavioral health recovery includes concepts related not just to symptom improvement, but also to participating in activities that contribute to wellness and a meaningful life. Video game play can relieve stress and provide a way to connect, which may be especially important for military veterans.
   Objective: We examined how military veterans used video game play to further their mental and behavioral health recovery by conducting an exploratory thematic analysis of the gaming habits of 20 United States military veterans who were in treatment for mental or behavioral health problems.
   Method: We conducted semi-structured interviews in 2016 and used a framework analytic approach to determine salient themes linking video gaming to mental and behavioral health recovery.
   Results: Veteran participants reported that video games helped not only with managing moods and stress, but also with three areas related to other aspects of recovery: adaptive coping (e.g. distraction, control, symptom substitution); eudaimonic well-being (confidence, insight, role functioning); and socializing (participation, support, brotherhood). Meaning derived from game narratives and characters, exciting or calming gameplay, and opportunities to connect, talk, and lead others were credited as benefits of gaming. Responses often related closely to military or veteran experiences. At times, excessive use of games led to life problems or feeling addicted, but some veterans with disabilities felt the advantages of extreme play outweighed these problems.
   Conclusion: Video games seem to provide some veterans with a potent form of "personal medicine" that can promote recovery. Although reasons and results of gaming may vary within and among individuals, clinicians may wish to discuss video game play with their patients to help patients optimize their use of games to support recovery.

SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACY AND THERAPEUTICS
LA English
DT Article
DE adverse effects; anticonvulsants; Levetiracetam; poisoning; toxicity
ID CHILDREN; SAFETY
AB What is known and Objective: Levetiracetam is an anticonvulsant agent that was first approved for use in the United States in 1999 and has a maximum recommended adult dose of 3000 mg daily. It has been noted to have a relatively mild adverse effect profile, with the most common side effects being somnolence, asthenia, infection, and dizziness. Although it has been widely prescribed, there have been few reports on the safety of this agent in overdose. Case summary: We present the case of a 49-year-old man who ingested over 22 500 mg of levetiracetam in a suicide attempt. The patient arrived at the Emergency Department 6.5 h after the ingestion and was noted to have no significant sequelae from the ingestion. Based on the patients weight, he ingested 358 mg/kg of levetiracetam. What is new and Conclusion: The few cases of levetiracetam overdose reported in the literature were associated with relatively mild, if any, symptoms. However, one patient who overdosed on levetiracetam became obtunded and developed significant respiratory distress that required intubation and ventilatory support. Therefore, clinical vigilance is still required in the cases of levetiracetam overdose.

AB Despite their neglect by researchers relative to other causes of death, motor vehicle and other accidents contribute substantially to sex differences in mortality and address theoretical debates over the consequences of gender equality. A reduction-in-protection hypothesis argues that gender equality reduces the female advantage in accident mortality, a reduction-in-inequality hypothesis argues that gender equality increases the advantage, and an institutional adjustment hypothesis argues that gender equality initially reduces and then increases the advantage. The analysis tests these hypotheses using data on age-specific male and female accident mortality rates and indicators of work and family status for 18 high income nations from 1955-1994. In support of the institutional adjustment hypothesis, declining differentials in male and female motor vehicle and other accident mortality rates level off and sometimes increase in recent years, and measures of work and family change generally have similar curvilinear influences on the differential. Across nations, gender equality speeds the reversal in the differential for motor vehicle accidents, but not for other accidents.

AB Gambling disorder is characterized by a persistent, recurrent pattern of gambling that is associated with substantial distress or impairment. The prevalence of gambling disorder has been estimated at 0.5% of the adult population in the United States, with comparable or slightly higher estimates in other countries. The aetiology of gambling disorder is complex, with implicated genetic and environmental factors. Neurobiological studies have implicated cortico-striato-limbic structures and circuits in the pathophysiology of this disorder. Individuals with gambling disorder often go unrecognized and untreated, including within clinical settings. Gambling disorder frequently co-occurs with other conditions, particularly other psychiatric disorders. Behavioural interventions, particularly cognitive-behavioural therapy but also motivational interviewing and Gamblers Anonymous, are supported in the treatment of gambling disorder. No pharmacological therapy has a formal indication for the treatment of gambling disorder, although placebo-controlled trials suggest that some medications, such as opioid-receptor antagonists, may be helpful. Given the associations with poor quality of life and suicide, improved identification, prevention, policy and treatment efforts are needed to help people with gambling disorder.

AB The aim of the study was to determine the longevity of jazz musicians (JM) and their mortality patterns. The obituaries of subjects involved in jazz music were reviewed in a specialized periodical from 1990 to 1999. Age at death, sex, activity (JM or non-musicians[NM]), and estimation of life expectancy (LE) at birth were recorded. Causes of death were compared with a distribution based on the general U.S. population, and proportionate mortality ratios (PMRs) were calculated. The study population consisted of 346 decedents. The age at death was lower in JM than in NM (70.4 +/- 12.4 vs. 74.7 +/- 10.4 years, p = 0.01), and 83.2% of JM exceeded their LE vs. 93.3% of NM ( = 0.046). Information on the causes of death was available for 212 decedents. Malignant neoplasms were the leading cause of death in JM. The PMRs were elevated for malignant neoplasms and suicide. The longevity of JM is lower than that of nonmusical decedents involved in jazz music; however, death before predicted LE is uncommon. Based on this review, malignant neoplasms are the main cause of death in that socioprofessional category.

AB African American youths have the highest risk for firearm and other weapon related homicides. This study utilized the national Youth Risk Behavior Surveys from 2001 to 2015 to assess trends in violence related behaviors and weapon carrying of African American adolescents. Our analyses found statistically significant reductions in physical fighting and weapon carrying among African American male adolescents from 2007 to 2015. Planning suicide increased in both male and female African American adolescents since 2007. In addition, the number offirearm homicides increased in African American males. African American females and males had groups of items highly predictive of weapon carrying behaviors: alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use and violent risk behaviors. Both female and male students who made mostly A's or B's in school were significantly less likely to carry weapons in and out of school. Our findings indicate that firearm homicides have increased in African American adolescents, but weapon carrying in school going adolescents has significantlydeclined. School engagement and satisfactory school performance seems to have a significantprotective effect on firearm homicides and violent behavior risks in African American adolescents.

AB Tim Nguyen is a 25-year-old, heterosexual Vietnamese American man who lives in a large Midwestern city. Tim and his 20-year-old sister, Terri, were born and raised in the United States; their parents were immigrants from Vietnam. Tim's father passed away soon after Terri's birth; both Tim and Terri were raised by their mother. Terri is a college student who lives on campus in the same city as Tim does. Tim lives with his mother and grandmother and works as a cashier in a supermarket.
   Recently, Tim discovered that Molly, his girlfriend of 5 years, had been cheating on him. When he confronted Molly, she promptly broke up with him, which left him devastated. When his mother found out about the breakup, she berated him for "losing Molly to another man." That evening, Tim locked himself in his room and attempted to kill himself by overdosing on prescription drugs. Tim's was discovered by Terri, who rushed him to the hospital for treatment. Fortunately, his suicide attempt was not life threatening. After being discharged, Tim was referred to a mental health agency for counseling. He was accompanied by Terri for his first session.

AB Background: Little is known about the prevalence of suicidal ideation among U.S. medical students or how it relates to burnout.
   Objective: To assess the frequency of suicidal ideation among medical students and explore its relationship with burnout.
   Design: Cross-sectional 2007 and longitudinal 2006 to 2007 cohort study.
   Setting: 7 medical schools in the United States.
   Participants: 4287 medical students at 7 medical schools, with students at 5 institutions studied longitudinally.
   Measurements: Prevalence of suicidal ideation in the past year and its relationship to burnout, demographic characteristics, and quality of life.
   Results: Burnout was reported by 49.6% (95% CI, 47.5% to 51.8%) of students, and 11.2% (CI, 9.9% to 12.6%) reported suicidal ideation within the past year. In a sensitivity analysis that assumed all nonresponders did not have suicidal ideation, the prevalence of suicidal ideation in the past 12 months would be 5.8%. In the longitudinal cohort, burnout (P < 0.001 for all domains), quality of life (P < 0.002 for each domain), and depressive symptoms (P < 0.001) at baseline predicted suicidal ideation over the following year. In multivariable analysis, burnout and low mental quality of life at baseline were independent predictors of suicidal ideation over the following year. Of the 370 students who met criteria for burnout in 2006, 99 (26.8%) recovered. Recovery from burnout was associated with markedly less suicidal ideation, which suggests that recovery from burnout decreased suicide risk.
   Limitation: Although response rates (52% for the cross-sectional study and 65% for the longitudinal cohort study) are typical of physician surveys, nonresponse by some students reduces the precision of the estimated frequency of suicidal ideation and burnout.
   Conclusion: Approximately 50% of students experience burnout and 10% experience suicidal ideation during medical school. Burnout seems to be associated with increased likelihood of subsequent suicidal ideation, whereas recovery from burnout is associated with less suicidal ideation.

AB Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training for Bhutanese refugee community leaders in the U.S. We hypothesized that training refugee leaders would improve knowledge of mental health problems and treatment process and decrease negative attitudes towards people with mental illness.
   Methods: One hundred and twenty community leaders participated in MHFA training, of whom 58 had sufficient English proficiency to complete pre- and post-tests. The questionnaires assessed each participant's ability to recognize signs of depression, knowledge about professional help and treatment, and attitudes towards people with mental illness.
   Results: Between the pre- and post-test, participants showed significant improvement in the recognition of symptoms of depression and expressed beliefs about treatment that became more concordant with those of mental health professionals. However, there was no reduction in negative attitudes towards people with mental illness.
   Conclusions: MHFA training course is a promising program for Bhutanese refugee communities in the U.S. However, some adaptations may be necessary to ensure that MHFA training is optimized for this community.

AB Backgroun: There are limited data on depressive symptoms and antidepressant use in ethnically diverse, urban elderly.
   Methods: Analysis of depressive symptom and antidepressant use data from an epidemiological survey of dementia in an ethnically diverse, urban, elderly community.
   Results: 21.5% (N=566) reported clinically significant depressive symptoms. Severity was inversely associated with socioeconomic status. 7.5% (N= 194) reported antidepressant medication use. Multiple logistic regression analysis adjusting for severity and other covariates showed that men and African Americans had nearly half the odds of using antidepressants. Antidepressant use was more frequent among Hispanics, those with more severe depression and more medical illness. Limitations: Combined sample; CES-D not validated in Hispanics and inner-city African Americans; depressive symptoms assessed at one time-point; lack of complete income data; geographically restricted.
   Conclusions: In this elder sample, taking into account depressive symptom severity and other confounds, antidepressant use is nearly half as likely among men and African Americans. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB AD increasing death rate as a result of violence constitutes a large group in medicolegal autopsies. Specially, deaths due to asphyxia are one of the most important causes in violence deaths.
   During the 21-year period from January 1984 to October 2004, there were 134 asphyxial deaths autopsied by the Department of Forensic Medicine, Trakya University, Edirne, Turkey. Asphyxial deaths comprise 15.7% of all forensic autopsies; 20.8% of the cases are aged between 30 and 39 years, and the average age was 41.9 years. Males constitute 79.8% of all the cases.
   The most frequent method of asphyxiation death is hanging (56 cases, 41.8%), followed by drowning (30.5%) and carbon monoxide poisoning (8.2%). More violent methods, such as ligature or manual strangulations, constitute 2.9% and 2.3% of all asphyxial deaths, respectively. Although it was varying according to the methods of asphyxiation, suicide was found to be the manner of death in the majority of the cases.

AB Objective. The current study sought to examine the psychiatric characteristics and rate of subsequent violence among those who uttered explicit threats to kill. Method. Data were drawn from 144 referrals of adults to a community-based forensic mental health consultation and treatment service. Each had explicitly threatened to kill a person other than themselves. Results. Assaults were made by over 20%, including one homicide, within 12 months of assessment. Two participants committed suicide in the follow-up period. Factors found to contribute to violence risk were substance abuse, prior violence, limited education and untreated mental disorders. Threateners were often habitual in their threatening behaviour and typically targeted those they interacted with on a daily basis. Clinical characteristics showed a psychiatrically complex group who shared many features of other offender groups. Conclusions. The type of threat that led to referral for a mental health assessment was not uncommonly followed by violence. Factors enhancing risk resemble findings from other groups of offenders. Those referred for clinical evaluation typically have complex clinical presentations and marked deficits in effectively managing interpersonal conflict. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) seropositivity may be associated with decreased memory in older adults. To further investigate the association between T. gondii seropositivity and memory in nondemented older adults, we obtained serum samples from 114 nondemented older adults evaluated by the Alzheimer's Disease and Research Center at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, USA. We determined T. gondii seropositivity and anti-T. gondii IgG antibody titer and examined associations with memory function while controlling for socioeconomic status, education level, age, and apolipoprotein E4 status. There were few associations between T. gondii seropositivity or anti-T. gondii IgG antibodies and memory, although there was some support suggesting an interaction between anti-T. gondii and sex. In the seropositive-only sample, there was an inverse relationship between anti-T. gondii titer and performance on the selective reminding test. Overall, we found little evidence of an association between impaired memory function and T. gondii seropositivity and anti-T. gondii IgG antibodies in this sample of nondemented older adults.

AB The current study investigated a methodological question of whether traditional, additive, quantitative data can be used to address intersectional issues, and illustrated such an approach with a sample of 301 HIV-positive, Latino gay men in the United States. Participants were surveyed using A-CASI. Hierarchical logistic set regression investigated the role of sets of variables reflecting demographic characteristics, gender nonconformity, and gay and ethnic discrimination in relation to depression and gay collective identity. Results showed the discrimination set was related to depression and to gay collective identity, as was gender nonconformity. Follow-up logistic regression showed that both types of discrimination were associated with greater depression, but gender nonconformity was not. Gay discrimination and gender nonconformity were positively associated with gay collective identity, whereas ethnic discrimination was negatively associated. Results are discussed in terms of the use of traditional quantitative data as a potential means of understanding intersectional issues, as well as of contributing to knowledge about individuals facing multiple structural inequalities.

AB We examined the role of impulsivity in the development of peptic ulcer disease (PUD). The subjects were initially healthy 4636 hospital employees aged 19-62 who responded to a questionnaire on personality, health habits, mental health, and PUD in 1998 and 2000. We used multivariate logistic analyses to determine the relationship between impulsivity and newly-diagnosed PUD among those employees who did not have PUD at baseline. Impulsivity was assessed with the Karolinska Scale of Personality. High level of impulsivity was associated with increased 2-year incidence of doctor-diagnosed PUD after adjustment of age, gender, education and shift work (odds ratio = 2.42, 95% confidence interval = 1.21-4.82). Additional adjustment for the effects of smoking, alcohol consumption, BMI, physical activity, minor psychiatric morbidity and diagnosed depression and other psychiatric disease had little effect on this relationship. The present study suggests that impulsivity may be a risk factor for the development of PUD. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Approximately one in three preadolescents (34%) is obese/overweight and one in four (25%) experience a mental health issue. Urban youth suffer from higher rates of these problems, and at earlier ages than their peers. This study's purpose was to determine feasibility/acceptability and preliminary effects of the COPE (Creating Opportunities for Personal Empowerment) Healthy Lifestyles TEEN (Thinking, Emotion, Exercise, and Nutrition) intervention on physical activity (PA) and mental health outcomes of 11- to 13-year-olds. A one group pre- and posttest design was used in a Midwest urban middle school. Preadolescents (n = 31) who received COPE reported significant decreases in anxiety and increases in healthy lifestyle beliefs and PA. Further, preadolescents at baseline with elevated anxiety, depression, suicide risk, and below average self-concept who received COPE reported significant increases in self-concept and decreases in anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation. The COPE program is a promising intervention that can improve physical and mental health outcomes.

AB The influence of legal offences on the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is a common discussion. A population of imprisoned delinquents diagnosed with ASPD was compared to delinquents without ASPD concerning sociodemographic, criminological and clinical characteristics to determine if ASPD can differentiate delinquents apart from committing legal offences.
   A total of 36 violent offenders with diagnosed ASPD and 29 violent offenders without ASPD were recruited in the prison of Straubing (Germany); 28 control subjects without previous convictions were recruited in the German population. All subjects were examined with the SKID-I and SKID-II, GAF, BIS-11, EPI and K-FAF.
   Violent offenders with ASPD differ from violent offenders without ASPD concerning the following parameters: high values of impulsivity, aggression, irritability, neuroticism and extraversion; low levels of psychosocial functioning, cumulative aEurobroken home" indicators and antisocial behaviour before the age of 11 (aEuroearly starters").
   Some features are suitable for the discrimination between offenders with or without ADPD, but our results indicate that samples are better distinguished by a dimensional approach, oriented toward their degree of characteristics.

AB The field of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is dominated by research conducted with Caucasian-majority samples in Western countries such as United States, Canada, Australia and European countries. This article critically reviewed the empirical research on NSSI in non-Western countries and among ethnic/racial minority individuals who live in the West to give voice to and understand the patterns of NSSI among individuals who do not fall within the dominant Caucasian majority. The study found both similarities and differences between Western and non-Western data in terms of characteristics and functions of NSSI. Differences in gender patterns in regards to prevalence of NSSI and methods used as well as presence of a more relational functionality of NSSI rather than emotion regulation functionality were two points of divergence in the findings of these studies. In addition, the findings seem to indicate that the role of ethnicity/race is mediated by important factors such as socioeconomic status (SES) and gender. Existing gaps in the literature and suggestions for further research are discussed.

AB Objectives. We examined the prevalence and associations between behavioral and identity dimensions of sexual orientation among adolescents in the United States, with consideration of differences associated with race/ethnicity, sex, and age.
   Methods. We used pooled data from 2005 and 2007 Youth Risk Behavior Surveys to estimate prevalence of sexual orientation variables within demographic sub-groups. We used multilevel logistic regression models to test differences in the association between sexual orientation identity and sexual behavior across groups.
   Results. There was substantial incongruence between behavioral and identity dimensions of sexual orientation, which varied across sex and race/ethnicity. Whereas girls were more likely to identify as bisexual, boys showed a stronger association between same-sex behavior and a bisexual identity. The pattern of association of age with sexual orientation differed between boys and girls.
   Conclusions. Our results highlight demographic differences between 2 sexual orientation dimensions, and their congruence, among 13- to18-year-old adolescents. Future research is needed to better understand the implications of such differences, particularly in the realm of health and health disparities.

AB This study examined differences in structures and processes of mental health care at Veterans Administration (VA) primary care clinics, comparing VA medical center (VAMC) clinics to community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs). A survey was conducted of nurse managers at 46 of 49 primary care clinics (23 VAMC clinics and 23 CBOCs) within a VA health care network in the south central United States. Integration of care and services overall was comparable between VAMC clinics and CBOCs. The service mix differed. Integrated CBOCs more often offered group therapy, medication management, and smoking cessation. Integrated VAMC clinics more frequently used written suicide protocols and depression screening. Distance to offsite specialty care and wait times for referrals were shorter for patients at VAMCs than at CBOCs. The provision of mental health care at CBOCs is comparable to that at VAMC clinics, although differences in patient access to offsite care indicate that full equity was not achieved at the time of the survey. Since 2000, the VA has initiated several programs to address this need.

   NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES; INTRACRANIAL INJURY
AB Aggression is a common neuropsychiatric sequela of traumatic brain injury (TBI), one which interferes with rehabilitation efforts, disrupts social support networks, and compromises optimal recovery. Aggressive behavior raises critical safety concerns, potentially placing patients and care providers in harm's way. Such aggression may be directed outwardly, manifesting as assaultive behavior, or directed inwardly, resulting in suicidal behavior. Given the frequency of TBI and posttraumatic aggression and the potential medicolegal questions surrounding the purported causal relationships between the two, forensic psychiatrists need to understand and recognize posttraumatic aggression. They also must be able to offer cogent formulations about the relative contributions of neurotrauma versus other relevant neuropsychiatric factors versus combinations of both to any specific act of violence. This article reviews the relationships between TBI and aggression and discusses neurobiological and cognitive factors that influence the occurrence and presentation of posttraumatic aggression. Thereafter, a heuristic is offered that may assist forensic psychiatrists attempting to characterize the relationships between TBI and externally or internally directed violent acts.

DE Tariq Ramadan; Yusuf al-Qaradawi; Paul Berman; Ian Buruma; Salafism;
   Muslims; Europe
AB Tariq Ramadan calls himself a bridge builder between Muslims and European culture, but contradictions in his theology prevent him from fulfilling this role. He is an Islamic intellectual who espouses democracy and pluralism, yet he believes that shari'a law is universal. He exhorts his European followers to refrain from anti-Semitic violence, yet he cites as an authority Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, who is an apologist for Palestinian suicide bombers. He calls for Muslims to be full participants in Western civic societies, yet he calls on Muslims to "resist" the neo-liberal economic order that forms the basis of Western society. Ramadan has made alliances with left wing politicians and academics in France, Britain, the Netherlands, and the United States, but he has a pattern of disappointing and frustrating his leftist allies. In the wake of terrorist attacks in Britain and the Netherlands, the British and Dutch governments called upon Ramadan to support peaceable brands of Islam in these traumatized countries. These efforts failed because Ramadan's most important constituency has always been "the Muslim street," and this makes it difficult for him to embrace liberal principles.

ID DEATH-PENALTY; INVOLVEMENT; ETHICS
AB Background: It has been found that physicians condone colleague involvement in capital punishment. Physicians' own willingness to participate has not been explored.
   Objective: To examine physicians' willingness to be involved in cases of capital punishment.
   Design: Survey exploring physicians' willingness to participate in 10 aspects of capital punishment by lethal injection, 8 of which are disallowed by the American Medical Association.
   Setting: United States.
   Participants: 1000 randomly selected practicing physicians.
   Measurements: Questions assessing willingness to be involved in and attitudes toward capital punishment
   Results: 41% of respondents indicated that they would perform at least one action disallowed by the American Medical Association; 25% would perform five or more disallowed actions. Perceived duty to society (P < 0.001), approval of the death penalty (P < 0.001), and approval of assisted suicide (P = 0.015) correlated with increased willingness to perform disallowed actions. Only 3% of respondents knew of any guidelines on this issue.
   Conclusions: Despite medical society policies, many physicians would be willing to be involved in the execution of adults. The medical profession needs to be better informed about the ethical issues involved in physician participation in capital punishment.

AB This article systematically reviews 75 studies that examine the prevalence of sexual assault victimization among gay or bisexual (GB) men, and lesbian or bisexual (LB) women, in the United States. All studies were published between 1989 and 2009 and report the results of quantitative research. The authors reviewed the reported prevalence of lifetime sexual assault victimization (LSA), and where available, childhood sexual assault (CSA), adult sexual assault (ASA), intimate partner sexual assault (IPSA), and hate crime-related sexual assault (HC). The studies were grouped into those that used a probability or census sampling technique (n = 25) and those that used a non-probability or ''community-based'' sampling technique (n = 50). A total of 139,635 gay, lesbian, and bisexual (GLB) respondents participated in the underlying studies reviewed. Prevalence estimates of LSA ranged from 15.6-85.0% for LB women and 11.8-54.0% for GB men. Considering the median estimates derived from the collective set of studies reviewed, LB women were more likely to report CSA, ASA, LSA, and IPSA than GB men, whereas GB men were more likely to report HC than LB women. Across all studies, the highest estimates reported were for LSA of LB women (85.0%), CSA of LB women (76.0%), and CSA of GB men (59.2%). With some exceptions, studies using non-probability samples reported higher sexual assault prevalence rates than did population-based or census sample studies. The challenges of assessing sexual assault victimization with GLB populations are discussed, as well as the implications for practice, policy, and future research.

AB This study aimed to merge existing methodologies of identifying high-risk soldiers to create a comprehensive testable model to assist leaders in the identification, mitigation, and prevention of negative behavioral health (BH) issues. In 2011, a total of 2,664 active duty U.S. Army soldiers completed a survey of demographic and military characteristics, combat exposures, and BH diagnoses and symptoms. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were fit to examine the relationship between demographic and military characteristics, subthreshold behavioral and social health issues, and positive screening for BH symptoms. The "recent loss of someone close" and self-reporting a history of BH issues were the strongest and most consistent predictors of subthreshold behavioral and social health issues. This study found that individual and occupational factors were associated with subthreshold behavioral and social health issues, which were in turn, associated with screening positive for BH symptoms. The recent loss of. someone close (an indicator of grief and loss) was not the study's primary research question, but warrants further investigation to determine its impact on the mental well-being of soldiers.

AB Objectives. We sought to determine whether sexual orientation is related to mental and physical health and health behaviors in the general population.
   Methods. Data was derived from a health interview survey that was part of the second Dutch National Survey of General Practice, carried out in 2001 among an all-age random sample of the population. Of the 19685 persons invited to participate, 65% took part in the survey. Sexual orientation was assessed in persons aged 18 years and older and reported by 98.2% of 9684 participants. The respondents' characteristics are comparable with those of the Dutch general population.
   Results. Gay/lesbian participants reported more acute mental health symptoms than heterosexual people and their general mental health also was poorer. Gay/lesbian people more frequently reported acute physical symptoms and chronic conditions than heterosexual people. Differences in smoking, alcohol use, and drug use were less prominent.
   Conclusions. We found that sexual orientation was associated with mental as well as physical health. The causal processes responsible for these differences by sexual orientation need further exploration.

ID UNITED-STATES; PREVENTION; VIOLENCE; SUICIDE; FIREARMS; INJURY
AB Recent debate on whether physicians should discuss gun ownership with their patients has centered on determining whether gun injuries are an issue of health or safety, and on protecting patient privacy. Yet, physicians' duties span personal health, public health, and safety spheres, and they often must address private patient matters. To prioritize gun safety and reduce gun injuries, the primary policy-driving question should be: will physician counseling on gun ownership effectively reduce gun-related injuries without interfering with the physician's other treatment obligations or compromising the physician-patient relationship? Existing data on physician-initiated conversations with patients about guns support a positive prevention effect. However, it is critical that physician-initiated discussions of safe gun practices are not motivated by, nor convey, disapproval of gun ownership. To be ethical, respectful, and efficient, the conversation should be standard between primary care providers and all of their patients (not limited to patient subsets); questions and education should be limited to topics of gun-ownership risks and storage practices; and the conversation must be framed without bias against gun ownership.

ID PERSONALITY-DISORDER; PREDICTION; COMORBIDITY; TIME
AB To date, only few reports are available regarding the long-term outcome of borderline personality disorder (BPD) in Japan. We conducted a retrospective follow-up study on the long-term outcome and predictive factors of BPD in Japan. Of 72 patients who received treatment at Fukuoka University Hospital between 1973 and 1989 and met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria for BPD retrospectively, 19 patients (26.4%) were followed up. We evaluated global outcome at follow-up using the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale scored from a completed self-reported questionnaire. The mean Global Assessment of Functioning score was 60.7, which meant fair to good functioning. The suicide rate was 6.9% (5/72). Using a logistic regression model, overinvolvement in family relationships and the number of medical facilities where patient was previously treated predicted poor outcome. These results are similar to those reported in the United States and Canada, except for the result that Japanese patients with BPD are more likely to live with their original family at follow-up than American patients.

AB Objective: Concurrent and prospective predictors of suicidal ideation were examined in a sample of 318 United States Air Force Security Forces across a 1-year deployment in Iraq and 6- to 9-month follow-up. Method: Participants included 294 male and 24 female Airmen ranging in age from 18 to 46 years, predominantly (67%) Caucasian. Measures included self-reports of postdeployment suicidal ideation, posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms, alcohol use, combat experiences, relationship distress, social support, and postdeployment readjustment. Results: Problem drinking before deployment prospectively predicted postdeployment suicidal ideation in univariate analyses. Depressive symptoms and problem drinking were significant independent predictors of postdeployment suicidal ideation. Findings demonstrated a ninefold increase in suicidal ideation among service members with even mild depressive symptoms if moderate problem drinking was also present. Conclusions: Pre-deployment problem drinking may serve as a modifiable target for early intervention of suicidal ideation. Findings illuminate the compound risk of comorbid depressive symptoms and moderate problem drinking in predicting suicidal ideation. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Sexual minority girls (SMGs) report large substance use disparities and victimization experiences, yet there is a dearth of research that focuses exclusively on SMGs. OBJECTIVE: To examine substance use and mental health disparities among SMGs and to determine whether disparities were larger for African American compared with European American girls. METHOD: Data were used from Wave 11 of the Pittsburgh Girls Study, a multiple-cohort, prospective study of urban girls. Girls for the current analysis were aged 16 to 19 years. Fifty-five percent were African American. One hundred and seventy-three (8.3%) identified as SMGs, and 1,891 identified as heterosexual. Multiple regression analyses controlling for age, race, and parent education were conducted. RESULTS: SMGs reported a robust pattern of large disparities in externalizing, internalizing, and borderline personality disorder symptoms. There was little evidence to suggest disparities were moderated by race. CONCLUSION: SMGs and their families would benefit from intervention and prevention programs to reduce disparities among this highly vulnerable population.

AB Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youths are over-represented in the homeless population. To examine why some LGB youths become homeless, this report compares homeless and non-homeless LGB youths. Of the 156 LGB youths, 48% reported ever being homeless (i.e., running away or being evicted from home). Results indicate that sexual orientation awareness and the initiation of sexual behavior occurred earlier in homeless than in non-homeless LGB youths and predated the first homeless episode. Substance use was more frequent and first occurred at an earlier age in homeless as compared to non-homeless LGB youths; however, substance use occurred subsequent to first homelessness. Childhood sexual abuse was associated with homelessness; and, early sexual orientation development was related to homelessness among youths without a history of sexual abuse. Findings suggest that interventions should help youths cope with their unfolding sexual orientation and work to prevent or address the consequences of sexual abuse. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recent research has shown that after long-term declining trends are excluded, mortality rates in industrial countries tend to rise in economic expansions and fall in economic recessions. In the present work, co-movements between economic fluctuations and mortality changes in postwar Japan are investigated by analyzing time series of mortality rates and eight economic indicators. To eliminate spurious associations attributable to trends, series are detrended either via Hodrick-Prescott filtering or through differencing. As previously found in other industrial economies, general mortality and age-specific death rates in Japan tend to increase in expansions and drop in recessions, for both males and females. The effect, which is slightly stronger for males, is particularly noticeable in those aged 45-64. Deaths attributed to heart disease, pneumonia, accidents, liver disease, and senility-making up about 41% of total mortality-tend to fluctuate procyclically, increasing in expansions. Suicides, as well as deaths attributable to diabetes and hypertensive disease, make up about 4% of total mortality and fluctuate countercyclically, increasing in recessions. Deaths attributed to other causes, making up about half of total deaths, don't show a clearly defined relationship with the fluctuations of the economy.

AB The U.S. Navy deploys Special Psychiatric Rapid Intervention Teams (SPRINT) to sites of military disasters to assist survivors and the command. SPRINT functions primarily as a consultant to help commands effectively respond to the mental health needs of their service members following a traumatic event. Utilizing the principles of psychological first aid, the overall goal of SPRINT is to mitigate long-term mental health dysfunction and facilitate recovery at both the individual and unit level. We present a case study of a SPRINT mission to a deployed U.S. Navy ship in response to a cluster of suicides and subsequent concerns about the well-being of the remaining crew. Throughout this mission, important themes emerged, such as the impact of accumulated operational stressors and the subsequent development of mental health stigma. Also, this case study demonstrates the potential effectiveness of introducing resiliency self-care meditation training to remote environments that lack ready access to mental health resources. From here, SPRINT can provide a model for immediate disaster mental health response that has potential relevancy beyond the military.

AB Examined prevalence of gun ownership and the links among gun ownership, reasons for gun ownership, and antisocial behavior in a sample of nonmetropolitan and rural middle school students. Participants completed the Questionnaire for Students (Olweus, 1995) and included 6,263 students from 36 elementary and middle schools, of whom most were African American (range = 46%-95% per school). Reasons for gun ownership were strongly associated with rates of antisocial behavior. Youths who owned guns for sporting reasons reported rates of antisocial behavior that were only slightly higher than those reported by youths who did not own guns. Youths who owned guns to gain respect or to frighten others reported extremely high rates of antisocial behavior. These high-risk adolescent gun owners were likely to come from families of high-risk gun owners, associate with friends who were high-risk gun owners, and engage in high rates of bullying behavior. Findings suggest that effective violence prevention programs must target high-risk youths, address risk factors that go beyond individual settings, and address a comprehensive away of risk factors.

AB Objective To describe current trends in nonopioid substance exposures and associated outcomes among teenagers nationwide.
   Study design In this cross-sectional study, we used 2010-2015 data from the American Association of Poison Control Centers' National Poison Data System and Poisson tests to document trends in the rate of calls to poison control centers involving adolescents stratified by sex, exposures by substance category, proportion of intentional exposures, and severity of exposures.
   Results The number of calls per 1000 persons increased from 5.7 to 6.8 for teenage girls and decreased from 4.7 to 4.3 for boys. Reported exposures to prescription and over-the-counter medications and illicit street drugs increased between 24% and 73%, and reported opioid exposures decreased by 16%. Among teenage girls, intentional exposures increased from 57% to 68%, with cases increasingly managed in health care facilities and more likely to result in worse health outcomes.
   Conclusions The increase in intentional nonopioid substance exposures among teenage girls, with serious and potentially life-threatening consequences, is a matter of serious concern. Similar trends were not observed among teenage boys.

AB Discussion of growing inequity in U.S. life expectancy increasingly focuses on the popularized narrative that it is driven by a surge of "deaths of despair." Does this narrative fit the empirical evidence? Using census and Vital Statistics data, we apply life-table methods to calculate cause-specific years of life lost between ages 25 and 84 by sex and educational rank for non-Hispanic blacks and whites in 1990 and 2015. Drug overdoses do contribute importantly to widening inequity for whites, especially men, but trivially for blacks. The contribution of suicide to growing inequity is unremarkable. Cardiovascular disease, non-lung cancers, and other internal causes are key to explaining growing life expectancy inequity. Results underline the speculative nature of attempts to attribute trends in life-expectancy inequity to an epidemic of despair. They call for continued investigation of the possible weathering effects of tenacious high-effort coping with chronic stressors on the health of marginalized populations.

AB Background: Mental health literacy refers to the knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders which aid their recognition, management and prevention. This study examined the mental health literacy and experience of depression in a random and representative community population. Method: The experience of depression and mental health literacy of 3010 subjects from a random and representative population were determined on the basis of responses to the mood module of the PRIME-MD and questions about a vignette of a person with features of major depression. Results: Those with major depression had significantly mure personal experience of depression than those with other depressions and those who were not depressed, but there were few significant differences between the groups in terms of mental health literacy. Of those with major depression. 40% considered anti-depressants helpful, but 40% also considered they were harmful. Conclusions: There is a considerable impediment to the recognition and management of major depression and a need for further community education programs. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI Textbook Content and Religious Fundamentalism
SO TEXTBOOK AS DISCOURSE: SOCIOCULTURAL DIMENSIONS OF AMERICAN SCHOOLBOOKS
LA English
DT Article; Book Chapter
AB Overview: This chapter explores the objection of Mel and Norma Gabler to the content of textbooks used in Texas during the 1970s, and their subsequent work with other fundamentalists in opposition to humanistic curriculum. Their objections were based on fundamentalist, Protestant beliefs. The chapter documents their objections, the influence they eventually had over textbook selection in Texas, one of the four largest textbook purchasers in the US, and their overarching objection to the inclusion in textbooks of issues such as abortion, euthanasia, contraception, and suicide. This analysis of the influence of concerned parents raises the ultimate question: Where does selection begin and censorship end?
   Key Concepts: Religious beliefs play a role in determining what is acceptable and unacceptable for the content of textbooks. For some people and in some areas of the United States, as well as other parts of the world, textbook content that contradicts what is morally acceptable and religious doctrine will not be tolerated.
   Questions for Reflection: Where might there be the most discord over textbook content, an area where many different religions are represented or an area where there is a large mix of religiously devout citizens and citizens who do not practice religion?

AB Corrosive chemical substance ingestions are a major problem, especially in developing countries, but also in developed countries such as the United States, France, and Belgium. Ingestions may be deliberate as suicide attempts (mostly in adolescents and adults) or accidental (mostly in children). The results can be devastating in terms of individual suffering and disability, but also in terms of resource utilization and costs. In developing countries, outcomes may be worse because of limited medical/surgical resources. Common sequelae include gastrointestinal (GI) tract (esophagus, stomach, pylorus, and duodenum) stricture formation, GI tract perforation, and hemorrhage. Systemic effects may also occur, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), multi-organ system failure, and sepsis. Various interventions in the acute phase to reduce the severity of injury have been attempted, but there are no large controlled clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy. Dilation therapy in various forms is commonly used for the treatment of strictures and a variety of surgical procedures including esophagectomy and delayed replacement may be required in severe corrosive injury cases.

AB Young women ages 18 to 25 make up approximately 30 percent of women arrested in the United States. Although health disparities have been found for incarcerated adults, health concerns for this subpopulation of women have not been as closely examined. Aiming to fill this gap in the literature, this study examined national data for young women ages 18 to 25 who participated in the National Survey of Drug Use and Health. Physical and mental health concerns were compared for young women with and without arrest histories. Young women with arrest histories had significantly higher odds ratios of multiple physical health concerns and all forms of mental health concerns, including recent suicide attempts. This study indicates that history of arrest is significantly associated with health disparities for young women and thus expands and builds gender-specific knowledge for the field of criminal justice epidemiology. Given the intersecting needs of physical health, mental health, and criminal justice involvement, the fields of public health and social work may contribute to gender-responsive interventions that incorporate health promotion specifically for this population of women.

SO HASTINGS CENTER REPORT

DT Editorial Material
AB As in the United States, the Dutch conversation about assisted suicide emerged primarily in the context of cancer. At least in that context, before acceding to a request for assistance in dying, caregivers must be sure that the person has made a voluntary and carefully considered request, and that her suffering is unbearable and without prospect of improvement. The Dutch have recently been trying to use those criteria in the context of Alzheimer's disease. Given the wave of Alzheimer's cases poised to crash onto wealthy countries, along with emerging technology to detect the disease process before symptoms appear, we should be grateful to the Dutch for that attempt. As a newcomer to this discussion, however, I was struck that those criteria may have a somewhat odd result. A patient with Alzheimer's disease can easily meet the conditions in the early stage of the disease, when one usually has the mental capacity to request assistance in dying and to make the case that one's existential suffering is unbearable. If one is in the late stage, though, it can be much harder to get such assistance because one does not have that capacity.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate how different types of child maltreatment, independently and collectively, impact a wide range of risk behaviors that fall into three domains: sexual risk behaviors, delinquency, and suicidality. Cumulative classification and Expanded Hierarchical Type (EHT) classification approaches were used to categorize various types of maltreatment. Data were derived from Wave III of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Our sample consisted of White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian females ages 18 to 27 (n = 7,576). Experiencing different kinds of maltreatment during childhood led to an extensive range of risk behaviors within the three identified domains. Women experiencing sexual abuse plus other maltreatment types had the poorest outcomes in all three domains. These findings illustrate that it may no longer be appropriate to assume that all types of maltreatment are equivalent in their potential contribution to negative developmental sequelae.

AB A diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) often signals the quintessential "difficult patient" status to clinicians, with at least one scholar arguing the condition itself was created to name and group difficult patients. While patients who are deemed difficult are often dispreferred for care, does this have an impact on their overall status as medicalized patients who have successfully achieved a sick role? This study relies on (n = 22) in-depth interviews with mental health clinicians in the United States from 2012 to evaluate how they describe patients with BPD, how the diagnosis of BPD affects the treatment clinicians are willing to provide, and the implications for patients. My findings suggest patients with BPD are routinely labeled "difficult," and subsequently routed out of care through a variety of direct and indirect means. This process creates a functional form of demedicalization where the actual diagnosis of BPD remains de jure medicalized, but the de facto or treatment component of medicalization is harder to secure for patients.

AB Background: Participating in civic activities has been found to be related to positive health outcomes. Objective: This study examines associations between injection drug use health variables (sharing paraphernalia, using shooting galleries) and political/civic engagement (identifying with any political party, attention paid to politics and being registered to vote). Methods: Participants (N = 162) were recruited at 6 New York City (NYC) methadone programs as part of an HIV intervention (86% male). Results: In the bivariate analysis, being registered to vote and political party identification were related to lower paraphernalia sharing; higher levels of attention paid to politics were associated with lower shooting gallery use. In the multivariate analysis, political party identification was associated with lower paraphernalia sharing and higher levels of attention paid to politics was related to lower shooting gallery use. Conclusions: Findings suggest that maintaining connections with mainstream civic activities can be related to reduced health risks, including HIV risk behaviors. Scientific Significance: This study contributes to understanding the relationships between involvement in civic/political participation and health, an area in which few studies have been conducted.

AB The objective of this study was to examine a sample (n = 55) of filicidal mothers to compare those with and without psychotic symptoms at the time of the filicide. Clinical data were gathered through retrospective chart review of filicidal women referred for criminal responsibility/competence to stand trial evaluations from 1974 to 1996 at Michigan's Center for Forensic Psychiatry. Most (52.7%) women had psychotic symptoms at the time of filicide. Women with psychosis were more likely than those without to have a history of substance abuse; to have past and ongoing psychiatric treatment; and to be older, unemployed, more educated, and divorced or separated. They were less likely to be first time mothers or to have had prior contact with Children's Protective Services. The psychotic mothers more often confessed, attempted suicide at the time of the filicide, used weapons, killed multiple children, and expressed homicidal thoughts and/or concerns about their children to psychiatrists and family before the filicide. Psychotic women were as likely as nonpsychotic women to have used alcohol or illegal drugs at the time of the filicide.

AB Sound mental health-a critical facet of human wellbeing-has the potential to be undermined by climate change. Few largescale studies have empirically examined this hypothesis. Here, we show that short-term exposure to more extreme weather, multiyear warming, and tropical cyclone exposure each associate with worsened mental health. To do so, we couple meteorological and climatic data with reported mental health difficulties drawn from nearly 2 million randomly sampled US residents between 2002 and 2012. We find that shifting from monthly temperatures between 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C to >30 degrees C increases the probability of mental health difficulties by 0.5% points, that 1 degrees C of 5-year warming associates with a 2% point increase in the prevalence of mental health issues, and that exposure to Hurricane Katrina associates with a 4% point increase in this metric. Our analyses provide added quantitative support for the conclusion that environmental stressors produced by climate change pose threats to human mental health.

AB Objective: There is a well-established link between migraine headaches and depression. However, it is unclear whether individuals with migraine experience a unique profile of depressive symptoms in comparison to individuals without migraine. Methods: This question was addressed using data from the Baltimore cohort of the Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study. The cross-sectional association between migraine headaches and each depressive symptom was calculated using logistic regression, and symptom profiles among those with migraine headaches (n=249) and those without (n=1480) were compared using generalized estimating equations. Results: Migraine headaches were associated with increased odds of reporting seven of nine depressive symptom groups by a factor of roughly 2. However, when the symptom profiles were compared, individuals with migraine headaches did not differ in their profile of symptoms. Conclusion: These results suggest that individuals with migraine headaches are more likely to report depressive symptoms but do not display a unique profile of symptoms. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB Kansas City is a microcosm for USA. Although Kansas City shows a relatively diverse population, it is one that is segregated along the lines of race and income. This is an inequity that is common to all cities across the country. With this inequity comes unequal opportunity to survive and to thrive. Firearm violence is a core component of this societal inequity. In this article, we present the proceedings of the 2019 Kansas City Firearm Violence Symposium, where distinguished experts in trauma convened to share their experience, evidence and voices of gun violence-directly and indirectly. There were discussions on topics such as the human toll of gun violence, the role of structural violence in its perpetuation, the intersectional nature of race with both violence and medical care, and guidance on measures that could be taken to advocate for the reduction and elimination of gun violence. This was a symposium that started a country-wide conversation between academia, healthcare, survivors and the community on the most pressing public health crisis facing USA today.

ID DEPRESSION; REMINISCENCE; ADULTS
AB Adults aged 65 and over are a growing population in the United States today. This population is underrepresented in the mental health literature despite the high rates of depression and suicide. Additionally, the newest generation of older individuals is more likely to seek therapy than past generations, furthering the need for mental health professionals to be prepared for treating older individuals. Erikson in Childhood and society, Norton, New York, (1950) describes this time period as being critical in terms of the final identity crisis, integrity versus despair. Integrity is marked by a positive evaluation of the individual's entire life, less anxiety about death, and a feeling of gaining wisdom. Individuals who do not resolve this crisis can manifest despair in a number of ways, including depression, anger, and regret. This model proposes utilizing Narrative therapy (White in Maps of narrative practice, Norton, New York, 2007) to understand how elderly individuals evaluate their lives in reference to their environment. The model utilizes externalization, unique outcomes, and re-membering conversations to unlock subjugated stories and promote integrity.

AB Transgender youth are at risk of stigma and marginalization which can negatively impact their mental and physical health. Transgender youth in small towns may face increased stigma and a lack of supportive resources. It is essential to find ways to enhance support and resources and mitigate the effects of stigma. This exploratory study utilized qualitative interviews and an online survey to examine how transgender and gender questioning youth in nonmetropolitan and small metropolitan counties perceive their communities in terms of size, community climate, and transgender-specific resources. Results revealed variations in community climate by county size. Interviews revealed more complexity in descriptions of climate including the presence of support and hostility and a lack of visibility of transgender identities, rather than based solely on community size. Community size was not associated with the provision of supportive resources; rather community climate was associated with the availability, utilization, and unmet needs for community resources, above and beyond the impact of community size. The findings from this study contribute to minority stress theory and have direct practical implications.

AB Theodore Millon was one of the most influential personality theorists of the 20th century. His theory was originally rooted in biosocial learning models and later reconceptualized as an evolutionary model. This foundation of Millon's work encompasses the entire life span. He had a genuine concern for humankind, especially children. His theory encompasses a comprehensive understanding of the relationship among childhood experiences, parenting styles, and recurring events throughout the life span in shaping the personality. Notable contributions to child and adolescent assessment are the Millon Adolescent Personality Inventory (Millon, Green, & Meagher, 1982), the Millon Adolescent Clinical Inventory (Millon, Millon, & Davis, 1993), and the Millon Pre-Adolescent Clinical Inventory (M-PACI; Millon, Tringone, Millon, & Grossman, 2005). Given Millon's influence on the personality disorders section of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the aforementioned instruments have personality constructs tied to familiar DSM categories, and among them, cover the age range of 9 to 18years old. His development of the Millon Inventories revolutionized personality assessment in the United States and abroad. Millon's legacies will live on through his works and through the respect and compassion he demonstrated toward others.

AB Big Data Analytics have become an integral part of Health Informatics over the past years, with the analysis of Internet data being all the more popular in health assessment in various topics. In this study, we first examine the geographical distribution of the online behavioral variations towards Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Syphilis, Tuberculosis, and Hepatitis in the United States by year from 2004 to 2017. Next, we examine the correlations between Google Trends data and official health data from the 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention' (CDC) on said diseases, followed by estimating linear regressions for the respective relationships. The results show that Infoveillance can assist with exploring public awareness and accurately measure the behavioral changes towards said diseases. The correlations between Google Trends data and CDC data on Chlamydia cases are statistically significant at a national level and in most of the states, while the forecasting exhibits good performing results in many states. For Hepatitis, significant correlations are observed for several US States, while forecasting also exhibits promising results. On the contrary, several factors can affect the applicability of this forecasting method, as in the cases of Gonorrhea, Syphilis, and Tuberculosis, where the correlations are statistically significant in fewer states. Thus this study highlights that the analysis of Google Trends data should be done with caution in order for the results to be robust. In addition, we suggest that the applicability of this method is not that trivial or universal, and that several factors need to be taken into account when using online data in this line of research. However, this study also supports previous findings suggesting that the analysis of real-time online data is important in health assessment, as it tackles the long procedure of data collection and analysis in traditional survey methods, and provides us with information that could not be accessible otherwise.

AB Objectives,To quantify We proportion of current. US gun owners who are new to owning Firearms and compare new versus long-standing gun owners with respect to their firearms and firearm-related behaviors.
   Methods. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of a nationally representative probability-based online survey conducted in 2015 in the United States. We defined new gun owners as current firearm owners who acquired all of their firearms within the past 5 years, but who lived in a home without a gun at some time over the past 5 years. We defined long-standing Firearm owners as all other current gun owners.
   Results. New gun owners represented 10% of all current US adult gun owners. In addition to being younger than long-standing gun owners, new gun owners were more likely to be liberal, own Fewer guns, own handguns, own guns only For protection, and store guns in a safe manner.
   Conclusions. Gun ownership is dynamic, with approximately 1 million Americans becoming new gun owners each year.
   Public Health Implications. Clinical guidelines should be updated to explicitly endorse re-evaluating household firearm status at regular intervals.

TI Providing Solutions to LGBT Homeless Youth: Lessons From Baltimore's

DE anti-oppression; Baltimore; homelessness; LGBT; youth
ID HEALTH
AB In the United States, nearly 1.7 million youth under the age of 18 run away from home and often end up homeless each year. Reports estimate that between 20% and 40% of the runaway and homeless youth population identifies as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) (Durso & Gates, 2012; Kaiser Family Foundation, 2014). This suggests that as many as 80,000 LGBT youth are homeless for over a week each year (National Alliance to End Homelessness, 2012). In addition, LGBT youth are more likely to suffer from poverty, substance abuse, violence, mental illness, and attempted suicide as a result of harassment and discrimination (Cray, Miller, & Durso, 2013; Kaiser Family Foundation, 2014; Swan, 2014). Grounded in social equity theory (Frederickson, 2010) and intersectionality (Crenshaw, 1991), this article argues that additional legal protections are necessary in order to ensure the constitutional rights of LGBT youth. A case study of the Youth Empowered Society (YES) in Baltimore City is provided as an example of a service-delivery model for this vulnerable population. Best practices are identified and anti-discrimination policies are recommended.

AB Introduction. Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is one of the Personality Disorder most frequently associated with Substance Use Disorder (SUD). According to different models, the Behavioral dysregulation-BPD subgroup has a higher prevalence of SUD and certain impulsivity behaviors than the other two subgroups.
   Methods. Out of 156 BPD patients, 47 were in the Behavioral dysregulation-BPD subgroup, 55 in Affective dysregulation, and 54 in Disturbed relatedness. All patients completed the SCID-II for DSM-IV Axis II Disorders, SCID-I for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) and Revised Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines (DIB-R).
   Results. In the comparison of the BPD subgroups, Behavioral dysregulation showed significantly more prevalence of SUD (alcohol and cocaine), and tendency for anxiolytics, higher impulsivity (DIB-R, but none in BIS-11), and higher number of suicide attempts and psychiatric admissions, although these was not significant in comparison with the other subgroups.
   Conclusions. This should be especially useful in the discrimination of BPD patients for different therapeutic approaches and prognoses.

   FOLLOW-UP; HEALTH; FAMILY; DIFFERENTIALS; DEATH; AGE
AB The theory that marriage has protective effects for survival has itself lived for more than 100 years since Durkheim's groundbreaking study of suicide (Durkheim 1951 [1897]). Investigations of differences in this protective effect by gender, by age, and in contrast to different unmarried statuses, however, have yielded inconsistent conclusions. These investigations typically either use data in which marital status and other covariates are observed in cross-sectional surveys up to 10 years before mortality exposure, or use data from panel surveys with much smaller sample sizes. Their conclusions are usually not based on formal statistical tests of contrasts between men and women or between never-married, divorced/separated, and widowed statuses. Using large-scale pooled panel survey data linked to death registrations and earnings histories for U.S. men and women aged 25 and older, and with appropriate contrast tests, we find a consistent survival advantage for married over unmarried men and women, and an additional survival "premium" for married men. We find little evidence of mortality differences between never-married, divorced/separated, and widowed statuses.

AB Mental health literacy is the knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders that aid their recognition, management, or prevention, and is an important determinant of help seeking. This has relevance in suicide prevention, particularly for those with major depression, the clinical condition most frequently associated-with suicidal behavior. In this study of a random and representative community sample, a vignette depicting classical features of major depression was presented to subjects along with questions related to mental health literacy. The responses of those with major depression, as delineated by the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders instrument, both with and without suicidal ideation, were compared to those of a third group of respondents. The results demonstrated that despite increased professional contact by those with major depression and suicidal ideation, there were few differences among the three groups on either open-ended or direct questions related to mental health literacy. This indicates that increased professional contact in itself was not related to increased mental health literacy, and suggests that more specific psychoeducational programs are required.

AB The past several years have been a landmark moment for violence prevention, with renewed attention on the part of many international agencies, but especially the United Nations, with its adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The latter invites the world community to collaborate in an inclusive, long-ranging vision for the future, highlighting our interdependence and collective responsibility for humanity's future. A growing awareness that preventing violence does not just reduce death and disability but promotes creativity, economic growth, and general well-being is at the heart of this "movement". An integration not only of the major disciplines but of various practical approaches is timely, and for this to occur, we require a broader overview of our existing societal structures. In this context, the remainder of this fifteen article series after a Global Health Studies course entitled, "Violence: Causes and Cures," will review the mechanisms that society has used in an attempt to stem violence. This article, the tenth of the series, will briefly cover the criminal justice system in the United States and around the world. While the criminal justice system has played a major role in the effort to reduce violence, we learn that systemic failures and perceived injustices can diminish deterrent effect, while community-based intervention, individualized programs, and alternative justice approaches show greater promise. Similarly, punitive measures such as solitary confinement and the death penalty require reconsideration for reversing trends of self-defeating, irrational practices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI 'Blowback' for Britain? Blair, Bush, and the war in Iraq
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID INTELLIGENCE
AB As debate continues over the conduct, the legality and the morality of the war in Iraq, this article addresses how and why Prime Minister Blair decided on the British road to war in Iraq. The article argues that Tony Blair was working within a mindset at both the domestic and international levels that meant he was predisposed to use military force against Iraq and indeed against other perceived threats to the West. His rnindset arose, we will argue, through fear rather than arrogance, through the experiences of the past two decades as much as contemporary events, and this meant that he systematically over-estimated the threat posed by Saddam Hussein. We postulate that Blair was not pressured into invading Iraq by President Bush. Rather, he believed that it was the right path for Britain to take, and that the overthrow of Saddam Hussein was actually the logical outcome of the 'Doctrine of the International Community' outlined in his Chicago speech in 1999. We go on to make the claim that by concentrating on Supporting the United States in its grand strategy, Tony Blair misunderstood the pattern of politics at home and perhaps more seriously of the 'threat' to the domestic security of the United Kingdom. This was not a danger from Iraqi WMD or even from 'foreign' terrorists as had happened on 9/11 but from home-grown suicide bombers, some of whom claimed to be inspired by opposition to Blair's wars. This was the blowback that mattered - and will continue to do so - for the UK.

AB Objectives There are little data regarding the practice of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in correctional settings in the United States. A survey was conducted to study the current practice of ECT in US prisons. We hypothesize that ECT is underutilized in the correctional setting. We also review the ethical aspects of using ECT for the treatment of mental illness in the prison population.
   Methods A 12-question survey via a Survey Monkey link was emailed to chiefs of psychiatry, or the equivalent, of each state's department of corrections. We examined the frequency of Likert-type responses, tabulated individual comments for qualitative review, and grouped for comparison.
   Results Email contacts for chiefs of psychiatry, or the equivalent, for the department of corrections in 45 states (90%) were obtained and a survey link was sent. Thirty-one (68.9%) of 45 responded to the survey. Respondent estimates of the number of inmates with mental illness in 31 prison systems varied from less than 500 to more than 4500. Of these 31, 12 (38.7%) had more than 4500 inmates with mental illness. Four systems reported the use of ECT within the last 5 years. Of those, one reported use in the last 1 to 6 months, and 3 reported use in the last 2 to 5 years. Of these 4 prison systems, all felt that they had up to 10 patients who would benefit if ECT continued to be offered or became available in the future. None of these systems provided ECT within the prison. The inmates were referred to a local state psychiatric facility, a university hospital, or other institutions. The reasons for not using ECT as reported by the respondents are grouped under subheadings of stigma, ethical concerns, logistical concerns, and others.
   Conclusions Considering the high prevalence of mental illness in prisons, one might expect a high prevalence of ECT responsive mental illness and, hence, provision of ECT to some prisoners with mental illness. However, our survey suggests that the use of ECT in prisons in the United States is low. Stigma, ethical concerns, and logistical concerns were the main hindrances for providing ECT to prisoners with mental illness. Given that ECT is the standard of care in certain clinical scenarios, physicians are obligated to offer such treatment to inmates when necessary. It can be argued that failure of the prison to offer the standard of care is unethical and unconstitutional.

AB With the presentation of nonsuicidal self-injury disorder (NSSID) criteria in the fifth version of the Statistical and Diagnostic Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), empirical studies have emerged where the criteria have been operationalized on samples of children, adolescents and young adults. Since NSSID is a condition in need of further study, empirical data are crucial at this stage in order to gather information on the suggested criteria concerning prevalence rates, characteristics, clinical correlates and potential independence of the disorder. A review was conducted based on published peer-reviewed empirical studies of the DSM-5 NSSID criteria up to May 16, 2015. When the DSM-5 criteria were operationalized on both clinical and community samples, a sample of individuals was identified that had more general psychopathology and impairment than clinical controls as well as those with NSSI not meeting criteria for NSSID. Across all studies interpersonal difficulties or negative state preceding NSSI was highly endorsed by participants, while the distress or impairment criterion tended to have a lower endorsement. Results showed preliminary support for a distinct and independent NSSID diagnosis, but additional empirical data are needed with direct and structured assessment of the final DSM-5 criteria in order to reliably assess and validate a potential diagnosis of NSSID.

AB Emergency department (ED) health care professionals often care for patients with previously diagnosed psychiatric illnesses who are ill, injured, or having a behavioral crisis. In addition, ED personnel encounter children with psychiatric illnesses who may not present to the ED with overt mental health symptoms. Staff education and training regarding identification and management of pediatric mental health illness can help EDs overcome the perceived limitations of the setting that influence timely and comprehensive evaluation. In addition, ED physicians can inform and advocate for policy changes at local, state, and national levels that are needed to ensure comprehensive care of children with mental health illnesses. This report addresses the roles that the ED and ED health care professionals play in emergency mental health care of children and adolescents in the United States, which includes the stabilization and management of patients in mental health crisis, the discovery of mental illnesses and suicidal ideation in ED patients, and approaches to advocating for improved recognition and treatment of mental illnesses in children. The report also addresses special issues related to mental illness in the ED, such as minority populations, children with special health care needs, and children's mental health during and after disasters and trauma.

AB Over the past decade and with the increasing use of the Internet, the assessment of health issues using online search traffic data has become an integral part of Health Informatics. Internet data in general and from Google Trends in particular have been shown to be valid and valuable in predictions, forecastings, and nowcastings; and in detecting, tracking, and monitoring diseases' outbreaks and epidemics. Empirical relationships have been shown to exist between Google Trends' data and official data in several health topics, with the science of infodemiology using the vast amount of information available online for the assessment of public health and policy matters. The aim of this study is to provide a method of forecasting AIDS prevalence in the US using online search traffic data from Google Trends on AIDS related terms. The results at first show that significant correlations between Google Trends' data and official health data on AIDS prevalence (2004-2015) exist in several States, while the estimated forecasting models for AIDS prevalence show that official health data and Google Trends data on AIDS follow a logarithmic relationship. Overall, the results of this study support previous work on the subject suggesting that Google data are valid and valuable for the analysis and forecasting of human behavior towards health topics, and could further assist with Health Assessment in the US and in other countries and regions with valid available official health data.

AB Objectives. To describe the health status of the transgender population in the United States.
   Methods. We used 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data that comprised a probability sample from 19 US states and Guam (n = 151 456).
   Results. Bivariate analyses showed that, in comparison with cisgender individuals, transgender individuals had a higher prevalence of poor general health (odds ratio [OR] = 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2, 2.4), more days per month of poor physical (b = 2.43; 95% CI = 0.61, 4.24; P <.01) and mental (b = 1.74; 95% CI = 0.28, 3.19; P =.02) health, and a higher prevalence of myocardial infarction (OR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.1, 2.5). In addition, more transgender than cisgender people lacked health care coverage (OR = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.2, 2.7) and a health care provider (OR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.0, 2.1), and they were less likely to have visited a dentist in the preceding year (OR = 0.7; 95% CI = 0.5, 1.0). However, transgender individuals did not differ from cisgender individuals with respect to prevalence of chronic diseases, cancers, or depressive disorders or in terms of health behaviors such as smoking, binge drinking, and always wearing a seatbelt.
   Conclusions. Our findings highlight areas of unmet needs in the transgender population.

AB The crude birth rate in 2002 was 13.9 births per 1000 population, the lowest ever reported for the United States. The number of births, the crude birth rate, and the fertility rate (64.8) all declined slightly ( by 1% or less) from 2001 to 2002. Fertility rates were highest for Hispanic women (94.0), followed by black (65.4), Asian or Pacific Islander (63.9), Native American (58.0), and non-Hispanic white women (57.5). Fertility rates declined slightly for all race/ethnic groups from 2001 to 2002.
   The birth rate for teen mothers continued to fall, dropping 5% from 2001 to 2002 to 42.9 births per 1000 women aged 15 to 19 years, another record low. The teen birth rate has fallen 31% since 1991; declines were more rapid for younger teens aged 15 to 17 (40%) than for older teens aged 18 to 19 (23%). The proportion of all births to unmarried women remained approximately the same at one third. Smoking during pregnancy continued to decline; smoking rates were highest among teen mothers.
   In 2002, 26.1% of births were delivered by cesarean section, up 7% since 2001 and 26% since 1996. The primary cesarean rate has risen 23% since 1996, whereas the rate of vaginal birth after a previous cesarean delivery has fallen 55%. The use of timely prenatal care increased slightly to 83.8% in 2002. From 1990 to 2002, the use of timely prenatal care increased by 6% ( to 88.7%) for non-Hispanic white women, by 24% ( to 75.2%) for black women, and by 28% ( to 76.8%) for Hispanic women, thus narrowing racial disparities.
   The percentage of preterm births rose to 12.0% in 2002, from 10.6% in 1990 and 9.4% in 1981. Increases were largest for non-Hispanic white women. The percentage of low birth weight ( LBW) births also increased to 7.8% in 2002, up from 6.7% in 1984. Twin and triplet/+ birth rates both increased by 3% from 2000 to 2001. Multiple births accounted for 3.2% of all births in 2001.
   The infant mortality rate (IMR) was 6.9 per 1000 live births ( provisional data) in 2002 compared with 6.8 in 2001 ( final data). The ratio of the IMR among black infants to that for white infants was 2.5 in 2001, the same as in 2000. Racial differences in infant mortality remain a major public health concern. The role of LBW in infant mortality remains a major issue. New Hampshire, Utah, and Massachusetts had the lowest IMRs. State-by-state differences in IMR reflect racial composition, the percentage of LBW, and birth weight - specific neonatal mortality rates for each state. The United States continues to rank poorly in international comparisons of infant mortality.
   Expectation of life at birth reached a record high of 77.2 years for all sex and race groups combined in 2001. Death rates in the United States continue to decline. Between 2000 and 2001, death rates declined for the 3 leading causes of death: diseases of the heart, malignant neoplasms, and cerebrovascular diseases. Death rates for children ages 1 to 19 years decreased for unintentional injuries by 3.3% in 2001; the death rate for chronic lower respiratory diseases decreased by 25% in 2001. Cancer and suicide levels did not change for children ages 1 to 19. A large proportion of childhood deaths continue to occur as a result of preventable injuries.

AB The current state of college student mental health is frequently labeled a "crisis," as the demand for services and severity of symptomatology have appeared to increase in recent decades. Nationally representative findings are presented from the Center for Collegiate Mental Health, a practice research network based in the United States, composed of more than 340 university and college counseling centers, in an effort to illuminate trends in symptom severity and patterns in treatment utilization for the campus treatment seeking population. Clinical data collected over 5 academic years (2010 - 2015) showed small but significantly increasing trends for self-reported distress in generalized anxiety, depression, social anxiety, family distress, and academic distress, with the largest effect sizes observed for generalized anxiety, depression, and social anxiety. On the other hand, a significantly decreasing trend was observed for substance use. No significant changes were observed for eating concerns and hostility. Utilization data over 6 years indicated a gradual yet steady increase in the number of students seeking services (beyond the rate expected with increasing institutional enrollment), as well as increases in the number of appointments scheduled and attended, with great variation between centers. Within the context of changing national trends, we conclude that it is advisable to consider the specific needs of local centers to best accommodate distinct student bodies.

AB Content/Objectives: No recent national studies have been published on age at death and causes of death for U.S. physicians, and previous studies have had sampling limitations. Physician morbidity and mortality are of interest for several reasons, including the fact that physicians' personal health habits may affect their patient counseling practices.
   Methods: Data in this report are from the National Occupational Mortality Surveillance database and are derived from deaths occurring in 28 states between 1984 and 1995. Occupation is coded according to the U.S. Bureau of the Census classification system, and cause of death is coded according to the ninth revision of the International Classification of Diseases.
   Results: Among both U.S. white and black men, physicians were, on average, older when they died, (73.0 years for white and 68.7 for black) than were lawyers (72.3 and 62.0), all examined professionals (70.9 and 65.3), and all men (70.3 and 63.6). The top ten causes of death for white male physicians were essentially the same as those of the general population, although they were more likely to die from cerebrovascular disease, accidents, and suicide, and less likely to die from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia/influenza, or liver disease than were other professional white men.
   Conclusions: These findings should help to erase the myth of the unhealthy doctor. At least for men, mortality outcomes suggest that physicians make healthy personal choices.

AB Purpose of ReviewTo summarise empirical research on the adverse and beneficial public health impacts of cannabis legalisation in states in the USA.Recent FindingsThe most consistent finding from surveys of drug use is that the legalisation of medical cannabis has so far not had an effect on rates of use or cannabis use disorders among youth, but it has increased the frequency of use among adult cannabis users. There are conflicting findings on the impact of legalisation of medical and recreational cannabis use on the following: cannabis use disorders in adults, rates of motor vehicle accidents in which the driver was impaired by cannabis, rates of suicide, and opioid-related harms. The legalisation of recreational cannabis use has increased emergency room attendances for cannabis-related medical conditions (acute adverse psychological effects, hyperemesis, and accidental poisoning of children). There is no evidence to date on the impact of medical or recreational legalisation on the prevalence of mental disorders such as psychoses, depression, and anxiety.SummaryThere is suggestive evidence that cannabis legalisation is associated with a range of public health consequences. However, current evidence is limited in the capacity to confidently conclude that these changes are the result of cannabis legalisation. The impacts on public health may take some years to become apparent.

AB Objective To determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of comorbid obsessive compulsive disorders and syndromes (OCD/OCS), compared with pure OCD/OCS among adults in the community.
   Method Data were drawn from the Zurich Study, a longitudinal cohort study of 591 adults in the canton of Zurich. Comorbid OCD/OCS was compared with pure OCD/OCS groups in terms of distress, impairment, family history, suicide behavior and treatment using multivariable logistic regression analyses.
   Results OCD was significantly comorbid with bipolar I/II and minor bipolar disorders, anxiety states (GAD, repeated panic attacks) and social phobia, whereas there was no clear association between OCD and major depressive disorder or phobias other than social phobia.
   Results suggest that comorbid OCD/OCS is common among adults in the community, with the majority of those with OCD/OCS having at least one comorbid mood or anxiety disorder with a prevalence of 7.4% compared to 4.8% of remaining OCD/OCS. Comorbidity of OCD/OCS and anxiety states was more common among women (85.6%) and comorbidity with bipolar spectrum was more common among men (69.6%).Comorbid OCD/OCS was associated with significantly higher levels of treatment seeking, impairment, distress and suicidality compared with pure OCD/OCS. Comorbidity with bipolar disorders significantly increased the risk for alcohol abuse/dependence.
   Conclusions Comorbidity of OCD/OCS with bipolar disorder and bipolar spectrum disorders is common and very probably explains the association between OCD and depression found other studies. The early recognition of bipolar/cyclothymic OCD/OCS may help to prevent the abuse of/dependence on alcohol.

AB Introduction: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common condition worldwide, and leads to degradation in quality of life and large socioeconomic costs. There has been increasing demand for new therapies with fewer side effects. SOCG (SOCG tablet) is a modified prescription of So-ochim-tang, which is widely used in Traditional Korean Medicine to treat MDD. We aim to evaluate the efficacy of SOCG in treating MDD, and identify the optimum dose.
   Design: The protocol we are following is that of a Phase II clinical trial with a randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled, and parallel design. One hundred forty-eight participants will be randomly divided into 4 groups and treated for 8 weeks.
   Outcome measures: The primary outcome will be the score in the Korean Version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Scores in the Korean version of the Beck Depression Inventory-II Korean Symptom Check List-95 (KSCL-95), State Trait Anxiety Inventory-Korean version, State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-Korean version (STAXI-K), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and the EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) will be considered as secondary outcomes.
   Discussion and Conclusions: Demonstration of human safety and efficacy of SOCG in the present trial and identification of the appropriate dose will justify a New Drug Application and a phase III clinical trial. Further, we expect that this new antidepressant will be able to increase cure rates, and alleviate the burden of medical expenses.

   BRAIN; MANAGEMENT; VIETNAM
AB The principles of management of civilian gunshot wounds (GSWs) to the head and spine have evolved directly from the experience gained in war by military neurosurgeons. The type of craniocerebral wounds being produced in urban gang warfare and suicide attempts using handguns or rifles at close range vary considerably from the lower velocity fragment injuries which are common in modern warfare. Civilian craniocerebral GSWs are often devastating. The in-hospital mortality for civilians with penetrating craniocerebral injury is 52-95% depending on the proportion of suicide victims in the series. The most important predictive factor is the post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Score (GCS). Many civilian victims (47%) present with GCS 3-5 and only approximately 8.1% survive. Of these survivors, 1.4% will have nil, mild or moderate disability without surgery and 4.8% with surgery. Higher post-resuscitation GCS is associated with a significantly improved survival: GCS 6-8, 35.6% and GCS 9-15, 90.5%. A selective treatment policy is recommended for the patients with GCS 3-5. There are many clinical and radiological correlates with poor outcome that help the neurosurgeon decide on operative versus supportive treatment. Early aggressive resuscitation, surgery and vigorous control of intracranial pressure offers the best chance of achieving a satisfactory outcome. Spinal GSWs are uncommon and the neurosurgeon should be aware of the principles of management and prognosis. The indication for acute spinal cord decompression is deteriorating neurological status. Steroids are not indicated for these injuries. Neurosurgeons should take an active role in formulating and supporting public policy which aims to reduce possession and usage of firearms and therefore the prevalence of gunshot injuries.

AB Background/Objectives Bariatric surgery is helpful in enabling sustained weight loss, but effects on depression are unclear. Reductions in depression-related symptoms and increases in suicide rate have both been observed after bariatric surgery, but these observations are confounded by the presence of pre-existing depression. The goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of bariatric surgery on subsequent depression diagnosis.
   Subjects/Methods In this observational study, a prospective cohort study was simulated by evaluating depression risk based on diagnostic codes. An administrative database was utilized for this study, containing records and observations between 1 January 2008 through 29 February 2016 of enrolled patients in the United States. Individuals considered in this analysis were enrolled in a commercial health insurance program, observed for at least 6 months prior to surgery, and met the eligibility criteria for bariatric surgery. In all, 777,140 individuals were considered in total.
   Results Bariatric surgery was found to be significantly associated with subsequent depression relative to both non-surgery controls (HR = 1.31, 95% CI, 1.27-1.34, P < 2e-32) and non-bariatric abdominal surgery controls (HR = 2.15, 95% CI, 2.09-2.22, P < 2e-32). Patients with pre-surgical psychiatric screening had a reduced depression hazard ratio with respect to patients without (HR = 0.85, 95% CI, 0.81-0.89, P = 3.208e-12). Men were found to be more susceptible to post-bariatric surgery depression compared with women. Pre-surgical psychiatric evaluations reduced the magnitude of this effect. Relative to bariatric surgeries as a whole, vertical sleeve gastrectomy had a lower incidence of depression, while Roux-en Y Gastric Bypass and revision/removal surgeries had higher rates.
   Conclusions In individuals without a history of depression, bariatric surgery is associated with subsequent diagnosis of depression. This study provides guidance for patients considering bariatric surgery and their clinicians in terms of evaluating potential risks and benefits of surgery.

AB Purpose: Few studies have examined the early development of a broad range of health issues of importance in adolescence in Latina (female) youth, despite their being potentially a vulnerable group. This study compared suicide and depressive symptoms, substance use, violence exposure, injury prevention, obesity, and health-related quality of life among Latina, African-American, and white females as well as Latino (male) youth in fifth grade, as well as differences related to immigrant generational status for Latinas.& para;& para;Methods: Data were from the Healthy Passages study, including 3,349 African-American, Latina, and white females as well as Latino male fifth graders in three U.S. metropolitan areas. Self-report items and scales were used to compare status on health-related issues. Generational status was classified based on the parent report of birth location. Logistic and linear regression analyses were conducted, including adjustment for sociodemographic differences.& para;& para;Results: Latinas showed higher vulnerability than white females for several health issues, whereas few remained after adjustments for sociodemographic differences (higher obesity, lower bike helmet use, and lower physical health-related quality of life). Latina's lower vulnerability compared with African-American females generally persisted after adjustments. Third generation Latinas, after adjustments, reported lower prevalence of alcohol use and fewer friends using alcohol, yet higher future intentions of alcohol use, than first and second generation Latinas. There were few differences between Latina and Latino youth.& para;& para;Conclusions: Latina youth generally report low vulnerability across health issues in preadolescence. To the extent they appear at higher vulnerability than white females, this may be related to their disadvantaged sociodemographic status. (C) 2017 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

   Method: Data were drawn from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Participants included 4176 depressed adolescents with suicidal ideation and behavior in the previous year. Weighted logistic regressions were estimated to examine whether adolescent racial/ethnic minorities had lower rates of past-year treatment for suicidal ideation and behavior in inpatient or outpatient settings, while adjusting for age, depressive symptom severity, family income, and health insurance status.
   Results: Among adolescents with any suicidal ideation and behavior, and suicide attempts specifically, non-Hispanic blacks and Native Americans were less likely than whites to receive outpatient treatment, and multiracial adolescents were less likely to be admitted to inpatient facilities. Apart from Hispanics, racial/ethnic minorities were generally less likely to receive mental health care for suicidal ideation, particularly within psychiatric outpatient settings. A pattern emerged with racial/ethnic differences in treatment receipt being greatest for adolescents with the least severe suicidal ideation and behavior. Limitations: The cross-sectional data limits our ability to form causal inferences.
   Conclusion: Strikingly low rates of treatment utilization for suicidal ideation and behavior were observed across all racial/ethnic groups. Certain racial/ethnic minorities may be less likely to seek treatment for suicidal ideation and behavior when symptoms are less severe, with this gap in treatment use narrowing as symptom severity increases. Native Americans were among the racial/ethnic groups with lowest treatment utilization, but also among the highest for rates of suicide attempts, highlighting the pressing need for strategies to increase mental health service use in this particularly vulnerable population.

AB Objective: This study aims to evaluate the trends and risk factors of severe buprenorphine outcomes (SBO) reported to the U.S. Poison Centers (PCs).
   Methods: We queried the National Poison Data System for exposures to buprenorphine from 2011 to 2016. SBO cases were defined as exposures that resulted in either a death or major clinical outcomes. Trends were tested using Poisson regression. Characteristics of the exposures were descriptively assessed. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the risk factors of SBO.
   Results: SBO cases (967) reported to the PCs increased by 66.6% during this period (114-190, p < 0.001). While adults between 20 and 39 years were more frequent in the SBO group (50.4%) compared to the non-SBO group (38.7%), cases under 6 years (29.6% vs 13.8%) were more common among the non-SBO group. Intentional abuse (20.1% vs 24.9%) and suspected suicides (13.7% vs 37.5%) were significantly higher among the SBO group. Multisubstance exposures were more frequent among the SBO cases (36.4% vs 71.4%). SBO risk increased with age, with cases above 60 years (AOR: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.14-2.42) demonstrating significantly increased odds. Suspected suicide (AOR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.53-2.28) and abuse (AOR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.13-1.73) cases were more likely to result in a SBO. Multisubstance exposures significantly increased the risk of a SBO.
   Conclusions: This study reflected an increase in the cases of SBO paralleling the rise in the buprenorphine prescriptions. Age, reasons for exposure and multi-substance exposures significantly increased the risk of SBO.

AB Background/Objectives: The number of Americans with opioid use disorders (OUDs: prescription painkillers or heroin) has increased dramatically, yet little is known about OUD among people with severe mental illness (SMI). Methods: Using the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (N=502,467), logistic regression was used to: (1) identify factors associated with past-year OUD among people with SMI; and (2) examine associations between OUD and adverse outcomes (e.g., suicide attempt). Results: After controlling for a number of factors, correlates of OUD among people with SMI included male gender, younger age, marital status (never been married), use of certain drugs before age 18 (especially marijuana), and ease of obtaining certain drugs. People with prescription painkiller use disorder (only) were 7.43 times more likely (CI=4.55-12.14, p<.001) than people without substance use disorder to have criminal justice system involvement, while those with: (1) heroin use disorder (only) were 18.78 times more likely (CI=9.22-38.24, p<.001); (2) both prescription painkiller and heroin use disorder (only) were 25.83 times more likely (CI=14.06-47.47, p<.001); and (3) all other substance use disorders were 5.15 times more likely (CI=3.95-6.72, p<.001). People with prescription painkiller use disorder (only) were 2.40 times more likely (CI=1.72-3.35, p<.001) to attempt suicide than those without substance use disorder, and those with all other substance use disorders (i.e., apart from OUD) were 79% more likely (OR=1.79, CI=1.45-220, p<.001). Conclusions/Importance: My findings on OUD and OUD outcomes can help identify and understand individuals with SMI who could benefit from OUD prevention and intervention efforts.

AB Objectives: Relatively little is known about whether mental disorders other than depression remit versus persist in later life, especially within nationally representative samples. Our objectives were to examine the prevalence of persistent mood, anxiety, and substance disorders in older adults and to explore a range of physical and mental health predictors of disorder chronicity. Methods: This study involved a 3-year follow-up design using Wave 1 (2001-2002) and Wave 2 (2004-2005) of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. Participants included 1,994 adults aged 55 years and older who had a past-year mental disorder at Wave 1 and who completed Wave 2. The primary outcome was the prevalence of persistent mood, anxiety, and substance disorders at Wave 2. Potential predictors of persistence included sociodemographic variables, physical health (chronic health conditions and physical health-related quality of life), and mental health (childhood adversity, suicide attempts, mental health-related quality of life, comorbid mental disorders, personality disorders, and lifetime treatment-seeking). Results: With the exception of nicotine dependence, the prevalence of persistent mood, anxiety, and substance disorders ranged from 13% to 33%. Only younger age predicted substance disorder chronicity. Significant predictors of persistent mood and anxiety disorders included physical and mental health comorbidity, physical health-and mental health-related quality of life, suicide attempts, comorbid personality disorders, and treatment-seeking. Conclusions: At least two-thirds of mental disorders in these older adults were not persistent. Sociodemographic variables had little influence on chronicity, whereas a number of markers of mental disorder severity and complexity predicted persistent mood and anxiety disorders. The findings have important treatment and prevention implications.

AB Children with disabilities are at a higher risk for various forms of violence including sexual violence, bullying, and physical violence compared to those without disabilities. However there are no studies documenting the prevalence of dating violence amongst a population-based sample of adolescents with disabilities. The purpose of this study is to assess the prevalence of dating violence victimization against high schools students with and without disabilities and to examine associations of dating violence with health risks by disability status among high school girls. Data from the 2009 Massachusetts Youth Health Survey were analyzed in 2011 using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression. Among high school students who had ever been on a date, girls (25.9 %, 95 % CI 19.9-31.5) and boys (9.1 %, 95 % CI 5.8-12.4) with disabilities were more likely than girls (8.8 %, 95 % CI 6.8-10.8) and boys (4.5 %, 95 % CI 3.1-5.8) without disabilities to report dating violence. Multivariate analyses indicated that high school girls with disabilities who experienced dating violence were more likely to report feeling sad or hopeless for 2 weeks or more in the past year, suicide ideation in the past 12 months, and drug use in the past 30 days compared to those with disabilities who did not report dating violence and those without disabilities who reported and did not report dating violence. High school students with disabilities are at a greater risk for dating violence victimization compared to those without disabilities and high school girls with disabilities who experience dating violence are at increased risk for experiencing poor mental health outcomes and substance abuse.

AB Aim: This study analyzed the trend of gender gaps in life expectancy (GGLE) in Japan between 1947 and 2010, and explored the correlations of GGLE with gender mortality ratio and social development indices.
   Methods: Using GGLE and social indices data collected from the official websites, we carried out trends analysis of GGLE by calculating segmented average growth rates for different periods. We explored the association between GGLE and all-cause mortality; and between GGLE and Human Development Index (HDI) while controlling for time trend, by computing the generalized additive models based on the software R (version 2.15).
   Results: Japan's GGLE increased in a fluctuating fashion. Across 53 years, the average growth rates varied widely: 0.14% (1947-1956), 1.43% (1956-1974), 1.06% (1974-2004) and -0.60% (2004-2010) (overall average 0.87%). The value of GGLE peaked to 7.00 years in 2004, and then has slowly declined (6.75 years in 2010). Age-adjusted all-cause gender mortality ratio had a statistically positive association with GGLE (P < 0.01), whereas HDI was found to have no such association.
   Conclusion: The increased trend of GGLE in Japan could be partly explained by increased disease-specific mortality ratios (male/female), especially those involving chronic bronchitis and emphysema, diseases of the liver, suicide and cancer. The recent decline of GGLE might imply that Japanese women have been catching up with the lifestyle of men, resulting in similar mortality patterns. This calls for gender-sensitive approaches to developing policies and programs that will help sustain healthy lifestyles to combat smoking and alcohol intake, and social support to prevent suicide.

AB Background: Despite the high rates of comorbidity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol dependence (AD) in clinical and epidemiological samples, little is known about the prevalence, clinical presentation, course, risk factors and patterns of treatment-seeking of co-occurring PTSD-AD among the general population.
   Methods:The sample included respondents of the Wave 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). Weighted means, frequencies and odds ratios (ORs) of sociodemographic correlates, prevalence of psychiatric disorders and rates of treatment-seeking were computed.
   Results: In the general population, the lifetime prevalence of PTSD only, AD only and PTSD-AD was 4.83%, 13.66% and 1.59%, respectively. Individuals with comorbid PTSD-AD were more likely than those with PTSD or AD only to have suffered childhood adversities and had higher rates of Axis I and II disorders and suicide attempts. They also met more PTSD diagnostic criteria, had earlier onset of PTSD and were more likely to use drugs and alcohol to relieve their PTSD symptoms than those with PTSD only; they also met more AD diagnostic criteria than those with AD only and had greater disability. Individuals with PTSD-AD had higher rates of treatment seeking for AD than those with AD only, but similar rates than those with PTSD only.
   Conclusion: PTSD-AD is associated with high levels of severity across a broad range of domains even compared with individuals with PTSD or AD only, yet treatment-seeking rates are very low. There is a need to improve treatment access and outcomes for individuals with PTSD-AD. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Major depressive disorder (MDD) is among the most prevalent neuropsychiatric disorders associated with HIV infection; however, its risks and neurobiologic correlates in diverse cultures are poorly understood. This study aimed to examine the frequency of MDD among HIV+ participants in southern Brazil. We hypothesized that the frequency and severity of MDD would be higher among individuals with HIV+ compared with HIV- and higher in HIV subtype B compared with C. Individuals with HIV (n = 39) as well as seronegative controls (n = 22) were enrolled in a cross-sectional, prospective, observational study. Current and lifetime history of MDD was diagnosed by MINI-Plus; symptom severity was assessed by Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Current and past episodes of MDD were significantly more frequent in the HIV+ versus HIV- group: current MDD, 15 (38.5 %) vs. 0 (0 %), p = 0.0004; past MDD, 24 (61.5 %) vs. 3 (13.6 %), p = 0.0004. The median BDI-II score in the HIV+ group was significantly higher than that in the HIV- (13 (8-27.5) vs. 2.5 (1-5.5); p < 0.0001). Current suicide risk, defined as during the last month, was found in 18 % of participants in the HIV-positive and none in the HIV-negative group. Neither current MDD frequency (8 (57.1 %) vs. 6 (40 %), p = 0.47) nor BDI-II score differed across subtypes B and C. HIV+ group may be more likely to experience current MDD than HIV-. This was the first study to compare the frequency and severity of MDD in HIV subtypes B and C; we found no difference between HIV subtypes B and C.

AB Background: Opioid therapy alone or in combination with benzodiazepines poses safety concerns among patients with substance use disorders (SUD). Guidelines for opioid therapy recommend SUD treatment and enhanced monitoring, especially in patients with additional risk factors, but information on monitoring practices is sparse. This study estimated high-risk conditions - psychiatric comorbidity, suicide risk, and age <35 and >= 65 - and described clinical monitoring among patients with SUD who were newly prescribed opioids alone and concurrent with benzodiazepines long-term.
   Methods: This study included VA Northwest Veterans Network patients with SUD who started opioids only (n = 980) or benzodiazepines and opioids concurrently (n = 353) long-term (>= 90 days) in 2009-2010. Clinical characteristics, outpatient visits and urine drug screens (UDS) documented within 7-months after starting medications were extracted from VA data.
   Results: Approximately 67% (95% CI: 64-70) of opioids only and 94% (92-97) of concurrent medications groups had >= 1 psychiatric diagnoses. Prevalences of suicide risk and age <35 and >= 65 were 7% (5-8), 6% (5-8) and 18% (15-20) among the opioids only group, and 20% (16-24), 8% (5-11) and 13% (9-16) among the concurrent medications group. Among patients prescribed opioids only and medications concurrently, 87% and 91% attended primary care, whereas 28% and 26% attended SUD specialty-care. Overall, 30% and 48% of opioids only and concurrent medications groups engaged in mental health or SUD care, and 35% and 39% completed UDS.
   Conclusions: Improvements in clinical monitoring are needed as many VA patients with SUD and comorbid risks who initiate opioid therapy do not receive sufficient mental health/SUD care or UDS monitoring. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Background: Emergency department (ED)-based screening for substance use, suicide, and safety is commonly conducted in the United States. We sought to adopt this ED-based strategy in South Africa to determine the potential unmet needs of this population. Materials and Methods: This prospective, observational study was conducted at two sites in the Eastern Cape from June to September 2017. Adult patients presenting to the ED with noncritical conditions were approached to collect demographic data, respond to screening questions, and receive point-of-care human immunodeficiency virus testing. Screening questions assessed primary care access, substance use, suicidal thoughts, and home safety. The data analysis was performed using STATA v. 15 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA). Descriptive statistics and cross-tabulations were performed to assess the proportion of patients with access to primary care, substance use, suicidal thoughts, and home safety. Relative risks were calculated using a generalized linear model for the appropriate exposures and outcomes. Results: Among the 2,074 patients approached, 1,880 consented to data collection. Half of the participants were male, and the median age was 34 years (interquartile range: 25-54 years). Screening questions revealed that 384 (20%) used alcohol in excess, 372 (20%) used tobacco, 174 (9%) lacked access to primary care, 69 (4%) had suicidal thoughts, and 55 (3%) felt unsafe at home. Most of those reporting substance use were male and between 25 and 34 years. Conclusions: One in five patients reported substance use, of which one in five did not have routine interaction with the health-care system. Routine ED-based screening could reach this missed population for timely intervention. The following core competencies are addressed in this article: Patient care, Practice-based learning and improvement, and Systems-based practice.

AB This study aimed to examine the association of lifetime abstention of sexual intercourse with lifetime Axis I and II psychiatric disorders, attempted suicide, past-year Axis I psychiatric disorder, past-year medical condition, past-year obesity, health-related quality of life, and health service use in middle-aged and older adults in the United States. Face-to-face interviews were conducted in the 2004-2005 Wave 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. Analyses were performed for the subsample aged 40 years and older (males = 14,427; female = 19,860). Lifetime abstinence from sexual intercourse, sociodemographic variables, prevalence of lifetime Axis I and II DSM-IV psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, and attempted suicide, past-year Axis I psychiatric disorders, 14 medical conditions, obesity, health-related quality of life, and health service use were obtained. The prevalence of lifetime abstinence from sexual intercourse was 0.90 % (0.88 % for males; 1.00 % for females). The adjusted risks of any lifetime and past-year Axis I disorder, any lifetime and past-year substance-use disorders, lifetime alcohol-use disorder, lifetime and past-year alcohol-abuse disorder, lifetime nicotine dependence, lifetime drug-use disorder, and lifetime drug-abuse disorder were significantly lower for who abstained from sexual intercourse than for those who did not. However, those who abstained from sexual intercourse were more likely to have a diagnosis of obesity and lifetime avoidant and dependent personality disorders. The unadjusted risk of dysthymic disorder was also significantly greater for those who abstained from sexual intercourse. Results indicate that the effect of lifetime absence of sexual intercourse on psychiatric disorders is mixed.

AB Objective: Despite substantial evidence on the prevalence and correlates of overweight and obesity (OW/OB) in adults with bipolar disorder (BD), little is known about this topic in adolescents with BD.
   Method: The method consisted of the National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement, a face-to-face survey of mental disorders from 2001 through 2004, using a modified version of the fully structured World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Participants were adolescents 13 to 17 years of age, with bipolar disorder I or II (n = 295), major depressive disorder (n = 1,112), or controls with neither mood disorder (n = 8,716). Analyses examined for group differences in the prevalence of OW/OB and for correlates of OW/OB in the group with BD.
   Results: There were no significant differences in weight categories across groups. OW and OB in adolescents with BD were associated with significantly higher lifetime rates of suicide attempt (odds ratio 3.02, 95% CI 1.11-8.24), physical or sexual abuse (2.82, 1.20-6.60), binge eating or bulimia (2.66, 1.13-6.26), and conduct disorder (2.60, 1.10-6.13) in covariate-adjusted analyses. OW and 0)3 also were significantly associated with seeing a professional for depression, being hospitalized overnight for depression, and receiving general medical treatment.
   Conclusion: The similar prevalence of OW/OB in adolescents with and without BD suggests that this potent association in adults likely comprises a consequence of BD or its correlates. In contrast, the strong association of OW/OB with proxies for depression severity, including suicide attempts and hospitalization, is already evident even in this young, nonclinical sample. Studies are warranted to determine whether early intervention of OW/OB in BD might optimize physical and mental health.

AB Background: Changes in per capita alcohol consumption are temporally linked to changes in rates of alcohol-related harm. Methodological approaches for analysing this relationship have been suggested, however, the problem of time lags is not well-addressed. This study provides a review of time lag specifications, looking at (a) time to first effect on harm, (b) time to full effect and (c) the functional form of the effect accumulation from first to full effect to inform modelling of the relationship between changes in aggregate alcohol consumption and changes in rates of harm.
   Methods: Bibliographic databases were searched and citation and reference checking was used to identify studies. Included studies were time series analyses of the relationship between aggregated population alcohol consumption and rates of alcohol-related harms where time lag specifications had been derived or tested.
   Results: 36 studies were included with liver cirrhosis, heart disease and suicide dominating the evidence base. For a large number of alcohol-related harms, no literature was identified. There was strong evidence of an immediate first effect following a change in consumption for most harms. Recommended lag specifications are proposed for a set of alcohol-attributable harms.
   Conclusions: Research on time lag specifications is under-developed for most harms although we provide suggested specifications based on the findings of the review. Greater methodological attention needs to be given to the rationale for choosing or applying lag specifications and the inherent complexity of the time lag process. More consistent and transparent reporting of methodological decisions would aide progress in the field. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: This study compares prevalence and types of medical end-of-life decisions between the Dutch-speaking and French-speaking communities of Belgium. This is the first nationwide study that can make these comparisons and the first measurement after implementation of the euthanasia law (2002).
   Methods: We performed a mortality follow-back study in 2005-2006. Data were collected via the nationwide Sentinel Network of General Practitioners, an epidemiological surveillance system representative of all Belgian GPs. Weekly, all GPs reported the medical end-of-life decisions among all non-sudden deaths of patients in their practice. We compared the northern Dutch-speaking (60%) and southern French-speaking communities (40%) controlling for population differences.
   Results: We analysed 1690 non-sudden deaths. An end-of-life decision with possible life-shortening effect was made in 50% of patients in the Dutch-speaking community and 41% of patients in the French-speaking community (OR 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.8). Continuous deep sedation until death occurred in 8% and 15% respectively (OR 0.5; 95% CI, 0.4 to 0.7). Community differences regarding the prevalence of euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide were not significant.
   Community differences were more present among home/care home than among hospital deaths: non-treatment decisions with explicit life-shortening intention were made more often in the Dutch-speaking than in the French-speaking community settings (OR 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.9); while continuous deep sedation occurred less often in the Dutch-speaking community settings (OR 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3 to 0.9).
   Conclusion: Even though legal and general healthcare systems are the same for the whole country, there are considerable variations between the communities in type and prevalence of certain end-of-life decisions, even after controlling for population differences.

AB Background: The transition from adolescence to adulthood is associated with stressful adaptation experiences that may increase symptoms of depression. We explored the prevalence and sex differences of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation in freshmen Latino college students in Puerto Rico, and identified stressful life events that could contribute to symptoms of depression.
   Methods: Two thousand one hundred sixty-three freshmen college students from the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) public education system were assessed for depression symptoms using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and stressful life events using open questions.
   Results: Nine percent of the sample reported depression symptoms at a moderate or severe level (BDI > 20). Chi square analyses revealed a significantly higher prevalence for three of the stressful life events in females than males: relocation (10.2% females vs. 7.3% males; X-2 (1)=4.13, p=.042), break-up of a significant relationship (25.3% females vs. 17.8% males; X-2 (1)=13.76, p < .001), and illness (11.2% females vs. 7.3% males; X-2 (1)=7.23, p=.007). The model that best explained the variance of BDI scores among females was the presence of suicide risk, relationship break-up, illness, and relocation for college, whereas for males a similar model without the relationship break-up variable resulted in a better fit.
   Conclusions: Freshmen college students present a broad range of depression symptoms and certain stressful life events are associated with an increased prevalence of depression symptoms. Early detection of depression and tailored prevention programs should be developed to improve both mental health and academic performance among the college population. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Depressive disorders impose significant costs not only on sufferers but also on their families and caregivers, their employers, and insurers who often pay the resulting medical costs. This chapter summarizes medical and health economics literature that documents the societal economic burden associated with depression, as well as the incremental economic burden of depression patients in comparison with their non-depressed counterparts. Since the first depression cost-of-illness studies in the mid-1980s, several articles have updated these societal estimates, most recently to 2000. The economic burden of depression in the US was estimated to be just over $83 billion at that time, of which $26 billion (31%) accounted for direct treatment costs, $5 billion (7%) suicide-related costs, and $52 billion (62%) workplace costs. Taken together, this research highlights two important dynamics: (1) managed care has a substantial effect on the economic burden of depression, both in its overall level and its mix of cost components; and, (2) changing general economic conditions have an important influence on the employment rate and treatment rate of depression sufferers. At the patient level, numerous studies have used administrative claims data to assess the excess health care costs associated with treating psychiatric and medical conditions that often co-exist with depression. Such research has found that treatment for depression itself accounts for only 40% of the overall health care and workplace disability costs of depressed patients. Another 40% involves treatment of comorbid physical conditions, and the remaining 20% involves treatment of comorbid psychiatric disorders (other than depression). Claims data research has also provided insight into such economic issues as the workplace burden of depression, the time profile of costs of depression patients relative to the onset of their first episode, the family burden of depression, and the economic role of comorbid painful physical conditions.

AB Introduction: Patients with self-inflicted burns (SIB) are thought to have a longer length of stay compared to patients with accidental burns. However, other predictors for a longer length of stay are often not taken into account, e.g. percentage of the body surface area burned, age or comorbidities. Therefore, we wanted to study the outcome of patients with SIB at our burn center.
   Methods: A retrospective, observational study was conducted. All adult patients with acute burns admitted to the burn center of the Martini Hospital Groningen, between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2013 were included. Data on characteristics of the patient, injury, and outcome (LOS, mortality, discharge destination) were collected. In patients with SIB, suicide attempts (SA) were distinguished from self-harm without the intention to die (non-suicidal self-injury, NSSI). To evaluate differences in outcome, each patient with SIB was matched on variables and total score of the Abbreviated Burn Severity Index (ABSI) to a patient with accidental burns (AB).
   Results: In total 29 admissions (21 SA and 8 NSSI), were due to SIB and 528 due to accidents. Overall, when compared to AB, there were significant differences with respect to mortality and LOS for SA and/or NSSI. Mortality was higher in the SA group, while the LOS was higher in both the SA and NSSI groups compared to the AB group. However, after matching on ABSI, no statistical significant differences between the SA and SA-match or the NSSI and NSSI-match group were found.
   Conclusion: With the right and timely treatment, differences in mortality rate or length of stay in hospital could all be explained by the severity of the burn and the intention of the patient. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To depict the epidemiology of deaths due to carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning in Tehran, distinguishing those at greatest risk for acute poisoning resulting in death.
   Methods: A retrospective survey was carried out with regularly collected information set in Tehran's Legal Medicine Organization, with a population of 11.1 million. The data included 666 deaths due to CO poisoning from January 2002 through December 2006. The principal consequence measures were age and sex standardized incidence rates for unintentional, suicidal, and undetermined poisonings for legal authorities.
   Results: The overall rate of unintentional poisonings over the 5-year period was 7.5 per 100,000, with an annual rate of 1.5 per 100,000. The 5-year rates were highest in people aged 25 to 34 years: men, 16.4 per 100,000; women, 7.8 per 100,000. For suicides, the 5-year rate was 0.1 per 100,000; annual rate, 0.02 per 100,000. The suicidal 5-year rates were highest in men aged 35 to 44 years, that is, 0.9 per 100,000; there was no case for women. Unintentional poisonings displayed a powerfully seasonal variation with the highest rates being documented in the months October to March. Over the 5-year period, increasing rates of death from CO poisoning were found annually to be approximately 20%.
   Conclusions: In this study, middle-age people, young adults, and elderly people were at the greatest risk for unintentional CO poisoning, and rates were highest in the winter months. Death from suicidal CO poisoning was very rare in this study; on the other hand, unintentional CO poisoning deaths are increasing in Tehran. Health authorities require to consider all populations in any prevention plan.

AB Background Immigrants are a growing segment of the US population. In 2003, there were 33.5 million immigrants, accounting for 12% of the total US population. Despite a rapid increase in their numbers, little information exists as to how immigrants' health and mortality profile has changed over time. In this study, we analysed trends in social and behavioural characteristics, life expectancy, and mortality patterns of immigrants and the US-born from 1979 to 2003.
   Methods We used national mortality and census data (1979-2003) and 1993 and 2003 National Health Interview Surveys to examine nativity differentials over time in health and social characteristics. Life tables, age-adjusted death rates, and logistic regression were used to examine nativity differentials.
   Results During 1979-81, immigrants had 2.3 years longer life expectancy than the US-born (76.2 vs 73.9 years). The difference increased to 3.4 years in 1999-2001 (80.0 vs 76.6 years). Nativity differentials in mortality increased over time for major cancers, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, respiratory diseases, unintentional injuries, and suicide, with immigrants experiencing generally lower mortality than the US-born in each period. Specifically, in 1999-2001, immigrants had at least 30% lower mortality from lung and oesophageal cancer, COPD, suicide, and HIV/AIDS, but at least 50% higher mortality from stomach and liver cancer than the US-born. Nativity differentials in mortality, health, and behavioural characteristics varied substantially by ethnicity.
   Conclusions Growing ethnic heterogeneity of the immigrant population, and its migration selectivity and continuing advantages in behavioural characteristics may partly explain the overall widening health gaps between immigrants and the US-born.

AB Background: The educational attainment of Koreans has greatly increased, which was expected to reduce the magnitude of the population attributable fraction (PAF) of mortality associated with low education levels. However, increase in the relative risk (RR) of mortality among those with lower educational levels actually increased the PAF. The purpose of this study was to examine the change in the PAF of lower educational levels for mortality in Korea, where educational attainment has improved and is associated with the exacerbation of inequalities in mortality levels.
   Methods: National census data were used to derive educational levels. The mortality-associated RR of lower educational levels was calculated by reference to national census and death certificate data from 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010. PAFs were calculated for all-cause mortality, malignant neoplasms, cerebrovascular disease, heart disease, and suicide by gender and age group (30-44 and 45-59 years).
   Results: The PAF of low educational level in terms of total mortality has decreased since 1995 in both genders. This trend was more prominent among those aged 30-44 years. However, the PAFs of suicide in younger females (30-44 years) and of cerebrovascular disease in older males (45-59 years) have increased. The RRs of all-cause mortality and those of the four leading causes of death in those with the lowest educational levels have increased, especially in females aged 30-44 years.
   Conclusions: The consistent and sharp increase in the attainment of education has contributed to the reduction in the PAFs of lower education for mortality, despite the fact that mortality inequalities have not improved. Efforts to reduce health inequalities must promote healthy public policy and address public health policies.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the evidence for the use of topiramate for alcohol dependence.
   DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (1966-June 2008) and Cochrane Database (2008, Issue 1) searches were conducted using the search terms alcohol dependence and topiramate. Bibliographies of selected articles were examined for additional BACKGROUND data sources.
   STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: English-language, randomized, controlled trials evaluating topiramate for treatment of alcohol dependence in humans were selected for review. Three randomized controlled trials and 2 re-analyses were identified. Findings pertaining to efficacy and safety were extracted.
   DATA SYNTHESIS: Evidence suggests that topiramate antagonizes excitatory glutamate receptors, inhibits dopamine release, and enhances inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid function. These mechanisms may be significant in the treatment of alcohol dependence. Controlled trials have described the use of topiramate, titrated up to 300 mg daily, for alcohol dependence, and have reported decreases in drinking behavior and improvements in quality of life. Adverse effects associated with topiramate included abnormal skin sensation, dizziness, taste perversion, anorexia, pruritus, and difficulty with memory and concentration. In one of the reviewed trials, adverse effects did not account for an increased withdrawal rate. However, in another, when topiramate was titrated over a shortened time period, an increased withdrawal rate was seen. Recently, topiramate has been reported to increase suicide risk, primarily in patients with epilepsy. No cases of suicide were recorded in the alcohol dependence trials.
   CONCLUSIONS: Results of published trials are promising, showing efficacy for drinking outcomes and quality of life as well as general safety. However, additional larger, longer-term trials are needed to establish the optimal patient type that would benefit most from topiramate treatment in addition to dosing, duration of treatment, and tolerability of topiramate for alcohol dependence. At this time, data are insufficient to support using topiramate in conjunction with brief weekly compliance counseling as a first-line agent for alcohol dependence.

AB Major depression and alcohol problems are common in primary care, yet little is known about the prevalence of alcohol problems in patients with depression or alcohol's effect on depression outcomes. We strove to answer the following questions: How common are alcohol problems in patients with depression? Does alcohol affect the course of depression, response to antidepressant therapy, risk of suicide/death, social functioning and health care utilization? In which alcohol categories and treatment settings have patients with depression and alcohol problems been evaluated? English language studies from MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and Cochrane Controlled Trial Registry were reviewed. Studies were selected using predefined criteria if they reported on the prevalence or effects of alcohol problems in depression. Thirty-five studies met criteria and revealed a median prevalence of current or lifetime alcohol problems in depression of 16% (range 5-67%) and 30% (range 10-60%), respectively. This compares with 7% for current and 16-24% for lifetime alcohol problems in the general population. There is evidence that antidepressants improve depression outcomes in persons with alcohol dependence. Alcohol problems are associated with worse outcomes with respect to depression course, suicide/death risk, social functioning, and health care utilization. The majority of the studies, 34 of 35 (97%), evaluated alcohol abuse and dependence, and 25 of 35 (71%) were conducted in psychiatric inpatients. We conclude that alcohol problems are more common in depression than in the general population, are associated with adverse clinical and health care utilization outcomes, and that antidepressants can be effective in the presence of alcohol dependence. In addition, the literature focuses almost exclusively on patients with alcohol abuse or dependence in psychiatric inpatient settings, and excludes patients with less severe alcohol problems and primary care outpatient settings.

AB Background Occupational injury deaths remain high for Law Enforcement Officers (LEOs). This study describes and compares intentional and transportation-related fatality rates in US LEOs between 1992 and 2002.
   Methods Workplace injury deaths among LEOs from 1992 to 2002 were categorized into "Intentional," "Transportation-related," and "Other," using the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries. Occupations included in this analysis were sheriffs and bailiffs, police and detectives, non-public service guards, and correctional officers. Fatality rates were compared among law enforcement occupations, cause of death, and demographics with rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals.
   Results During the 11-year period, 2,280 workers died from an occupational injury, for a fatality rate of 11.8 per 100,000 across all LEO occupations. Forty-seven percent were homicides (n = 1,072, rate 5.6 per 100,000), 36% transportation-related (n = 815, rate 4.2 per 100,000), 11% were due to other causes (n = 249, rate 1.3 per 100,000), and 5% were workplace suicides (n = 122, rate 0.6 per 100,000). The proportion of fatalities by cause of death differed significantly between occupations (P < 0.0001). Sheriffs and bailiff experience a high risk for occupational injury death compared to other law enforcement occupations. Of the transportation-related fatalities, LEOs were operating a motor-vehicle in 58% of the incidents and 22% of the fatalities were struck by incidents.
   Conclusions Transportation-related deaths were nearly as common as homicides as a cause of occupational injury death among US LEOs. Struck by vehicle incidents remain an important and overlooked cause of death. This research points to opportunities for the prevention of transportation-related deaths in law enforcement. Am. J.

AB Background & Aims: Acetaminophen overdose is the most common cause of acute liver failure in the U.S. and other Western countries. Unintentional overdoses, alcohol abuse, and underlying liver disease might increase the risk of hepatotoxicity. In this population-based study, we examined outcomes of acetaminophen overdose, with particular attention to these risk factors. Methods: Patients hospitalized for acetaminophen overdose between 1995 and 2004 were identified retrospectively by using administrative data. Comorbid conditions, suicidal intent, and hepatotoxicity were identified by using International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision-Clinical Modification and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Health-Related Problems, 10th revision diagnostic codes. Results: During the 10-year interval, 1543 patients were hospitalized for acetaminophen overdose; 34% were alcohol abusers, 3% had liver disease, and 13% overdosed unintentionally. Seventy patients (4.5%) developed hepatotoxicity. Unintentional overdoses (odds ratio [OR], 5.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.00 - 8.95), alcohol abuse (OR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.30-3.76), underlying liver disease (OR, 3.50; 95% CI, 1.57-7.77), and N-acetylcysteine treatment (OR, 6.75; 95% CI, 2.78-16.39) were independently associated with hepatotoxicity. Fifteen patients (1.0%) died in-hospital; risk factors included older age, unintentional overdoses, alcohol abuse, comorbidities including liver disease, and hepatotoxicity (14% vs 0.3%; P <.0005). During a median follow-up of 5.2 years (range, 1 day-11.0 years), 79 patients (5.1%) died. Approximately half of these deaths were due to preventable conditions including suicide, substance abuse, and trauma. Conclusions: In this population-based study, acetaminophen overdose had a relatively benign short-term course but was associated with substantial long-term mortality caused by preventable conditions. Acetaminophen-related hepatotoxicity is more common in patients with unintentional overdoses, alcohol abuse, and underlying liver disease.

AB Background: Immigration stress appears to augment the risk for suicide behaviors for Latinos. Yet, specific risk factors that contribute to suicidal ideation (SI) among diverse Latino immigrant populations are not well established.
   Methods: Data were collected in Boston, Madrid and Barcelona using a screening battery assessing mental health, substance abuse risk, trauma exposure, demographics, and sociocultural factors. Prevalence rates of lifetime and 30-day SI were compared across sites. Logistic regression modeling was used to identify sociodemographic, clinical, and sociocultural-contextual factors associated with 30-day SI.
   Results: Five hundred and sixty-seven Latino patients from primary care, behavioral health and HIV clinics and community agencies participated. Rates of lifetime SI ranged from 29-35%; rates for 30-day SI were 21-23%. Rates of SI were not statistically different between sites. Factors associated with SI included exposure to discrimination, lower ethnic identity, elevated family conflict, and low sense of belonging (P < 0.01). In the adjusted model, higher scores on depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and trauma exposure were significantly associated with 30-day SI (OR = 1.14, 1.04, and 7.76, respectively). Greater number of years living in the host country was significantly associated with increased odds of having SI (OR = 2.22) while having citizenship status was associated with lower odds (OR = 0.45).
   Conclusion: Latinos suffering depression, trauma exposure, and immigration stressors are more likely to experience SI. Despite differences in country of origin, education, and other demographic factors between countries, rates of SI did not differ. Recommendations for prevention and clinical practice for addressing suicidal ideation risk among Latino immigrants are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Existing research and media reports convey conflicting impressions of trends in the prevalence of mental illness. We sought to investigate trends in the prevalence of symptoms of mental illness in a large population-based cohort of Canadian children and adolescents.
   Methods: We obtained population-based data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth. Every 2 years, participants completed self-reported measures of mental illness indicators, including conduct disorder, hyperactivity, indirect aggression, suicidal behaviour, and depression and anxiety. We analyzed trends in mean scores over time using linear regression.
   Results: We evaluated 11 725 participants aged 10-11 years from cycles 1 (1994/95) through 6 (2004/05), 10 574 aged 12-13 years from cycles 2 (1996/97) through 7 (2006/07), and 9835 aged 14-15 years from cycles 3 (1998/99) through 8 (2008/09). The distribution of scores on depression and anxiety, conduct and indirect aggression scales remained stable or showed small decreases over time for participants of all ages. The mean hyperactivity score increased over time in participants aged 10-11 years (change per 2-year cycle: 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.12) and those aged 12-13 years (0.13, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.18). Over time, fewer participants aged 12-13 years (0.40% per cycle, 95% CI -0.78 to -0.07) and aged 14-15 years (0.56% per cycle, 95% CI -0.91 to -0.23) reported attempting suicide in the previous 12 months.
   Interpretation: With the exception of hyperactivity, the prevalence of symptoms of mental illness in Canadian children and adolescents has remained relatively stable from 1994/95 to 2008/09. Conflicting reports of escalating rates of mental illness in Canada may be explained by differing methodologies between studies, an increase in treatment-seeking behaviour, or changes in diagnostic criteria or practices.

AB Study objective: To determine the association of regional income inequality within New Zealand with mortality among 25-64 year olds.
   Design: Individual census and mortality records were linked over the 1991-94 period. Income inequality (Gini coefficients) and average household income variables were calculated for 35 regions. "Individual level" variables were sex, age, ethnicity, household income, rurality, and small area socioeconomic deprivation. Logistic regression was used for the analyses. Sensitivity analyses for the level of regional aggregation were conducted.
   Participants: 1.4 million New Zealand census respondents aged 25-64 years followed up for mortality for three years.
   Main results: Controlling for age, ethnicity, rurality, household income, and regional mean income, there was no association of income inequality with all cause mortality for either men (OR= 1.007 for a 0.01 increase in the Gini, 95% confidence intervals 0.989 to 1.024) or women (OR= 1.004, 0.983 to 1.026). By cause of death (cancer, cardiovascular disease, unintentional injury, and suicide) there was some suggestion of a positive association for female unintentional injury (OR= 1.068, 0.952 to 1.198) and suicide (OR= 1.087, 0.957 to 1.234) but the 95% confidence intervals all included 1.0. Failure to control for ethnicity at the individual level resulted in some association of increasing regional income inequality with increasing mortality risk. Using fewer (n= 14) or more (n=73) regional divisions did not substantially change the findings.
   Conclusion: There is no convincing evidence of an association of income inequality within New Zealand with adult mortality. Previous ecological analyses within New Zealand suggesting an association of income inequality with mortality were confounded by ethnicity at the individual level. However, this study does not refute the possibility that income inequality at the national level affects health.

AB Civilian gunshot wounds to the head (cGSWH) are devastating, but there is no consensus regarding prognosis and management. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to identify prognostic factors associated with mortality. PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were queried for retrospective cohort studies of isolated cGSWH reporting mortality prognostic factors. Meta-Analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines were followed. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Primary outcome was mortality. Pooled estimates of odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived using random-effects models. Seventeen (17) observational studies (1774 patients) were identified and included. Factors associated with mortality were: age >40 years (OR, 3.44; 95% CI [1.71-6.91]), suicide attempt (5.78; [3.07-10.87]), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 3-8 compared with 9-15 (38.02; [21.98-65.77]), GCS 3-5 versus 6-8 (15.38; [6.72-35.23], bilateral fixed and dilated pupils versus normal (67.12; [16.67-270.22]), and versus unilateral fixed and dilated pupil (25.35; [5.82-110.41]), dural penetration (29.07; [4.30-196.53]) and bihemispheric (4.23; [2.32-7.68]), and multi-lobar injuries (6.53; [1.99-21.42]). Selection for operative management, according to expert neurosurgical opinion, was protective (0.06; [0.01-0.22]). This is the first meta-analysis on cGSWH mortality prognostic factors. Increasing age, suicide attempt, lower GCS, bilateral mydriasis, dural penetration, and bihemispheric and multi-lobar injury are associated with increased mortality. This study can serve as a guide to clinicians and will provide directions for future research to develop evidence-based management algorithms.

AB Introduction: Published research indicates that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with increased mortality. However, causes of death among treatment-seeking patients with PTSD remain poorly characterized. The study objective was to describe causes of death among Veterans with PTSD to inform preventive interventions for this treatment population.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted for all Veterans who initiated PTSD treatment at any Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center from fiscal year 2008 to 2013. The primary outcome was mortality within the first year after treatment initiation. In 2018, collected data were analyzed to determine leading causes of death. For the top ten causes, standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated from age- and sex-matched mortality tables of the U.S. general population.
   Results: A total of 491,040 Veterans were identified who initiated PTSD treatment. Mean age was 48.5 (+/- 16.0) years, 90.7% were male, and 63.5% were of white race. In the year following treatment initiation, 1.1% (5,215/491,040) died. All-cause mortality was significantly higher for Veterans with PTSD compared with the U.S. population (SMR=1.05, 95% CI=1.02, 1.08, p<0.001). Veterans with PTSD had a significant increase in mortality from suicide (SMR=2.52, 95% CI=2.24, 2.82, p<0.001), accidental injury (SMR=1.99, 95% CI=1.83, 2.16, p<0.001), and viral hepatitis (SMR=2.26, 95% CI=1.68, 2.93, p<0.001) versus the U.S. population. Of those dying from accidental injury, more than half died of poisoning (52.3%, 325/622).
   Conclusions: Veterans with PTSD have an elevated risk of death from suicide, accidental injury, and viral hepatitis. Preventive interventions should target these important causes of death. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

AB Clozapine is effective for treating positive symptoms in approximately two-thirds of the 30% of patients with schizophrenia whose psychosis is minimally responsive to typical or atypical antipsychotic drugs at ordinary doses. The dose range at which clozapine is effective in treatment-resistant patients is 2-3 times higher than that needed in non-treatment-resistant patients. The onset of efficacy in these patients may not be until 3-6 months after initiating treatment. There are no established means of augmenting the efficacy of clozapine in treatment-resistant patients, but electroconvulsive therapy has empirically been found to be effective in those whose psychotic symptoms persist despite an adequate trial of clozapine monotherapy. Optimal treatment with clozapine requires attention to psychosocial needs and rehabilitation of patients whose work and social function is usually impaired due to cognitive dysfunction and persistent psychosis. No other antipsychotic drug has been robustly shown to be as effective as clozapine for this group of patients. In addition, clozapine is indicated for patients with schizophrenia who are intolerant to other antipsychotic drugs or, due to its unique antisuicidal effect, those who are at high risk for suicide. Clozapine can also improve some domains of social and cognitive function, leading to marked improvement in overall function and quality of life. Although clozapine causes agranulocytosis significantly more frequently than other antipsychotic drugs, with required hematological monitoring of the white count, its occurrence has been reduced to <0.5% and associated mortality is now extremely rare. While clozapine also causes weight gain and other metabolic side effects, myocarditis, tachycardia, hypersalivation, and seizures, its advantages in treating positive symptoms, suicide risk, and cognitive and social function, lead to a positive benefit-to-risk ratio that make it an invaluable addition to the armamentarium for treating treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

AB Some people say that depression feels like a black curtain of despair coming down over their lives. Many people feel like they have no energy and can't concentrate. Others feel irritable all the time for no apparent reason. The symptoms vary from person to person, but if some person feels "down" for more than two weeks, and these feelings are interfering with his/her daily life, he/she may be clinically depressed[1].
   History has shown that the experience of deployment to war can have legacies that manifest themselves in a variety of physical and psychological health problems [2,3]. It is widely recognised that exposure to combat and other wartime experiences can have both short-term and long-term psychological effects [4]. War related imprisonment has been shown as a stressful event associated with the exhibition of higher rates and greater intensity of posttraumatic stress reactions, compared with war veterans who were not imprisoned. This indicates that wartime captivity produces stress residuals of considerable depth, range and persistence [5]. There is a strong indication that stressor characteristics influence the variety and number of exhibited intrusive, avoidance and arousal symptoms. Victims of rape tended to present with more avoidance symptoms and fewer hyperarousal symptoms, whereas former prisoners and veterans tended to report more hyperarousal symptoms. Rape victims and former prisoners also reported more symptoms than the other groups(5). Groups suffering different types of trauma may show similarities in psychological dimensions of depression [5].
   The prevalence of psychological effects after conflict suggest that traumatic exposure and resultant symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression can influence social functioning and how individuals perceive mechanisms aimed at promoting justice and reconciliation, such as amnesties, criminal trials, and truth commissions [6].
   More than 90% of completed suicides are associated with mental or addictive disorders. These disorders provide the major context for suicide and suicidal behavior [7].

AB Background: End-of-life care poses fundamental ethical problems to clinicians. Defining euthanasia is a difficult and complex task, which causes confusion in its practical clinical application. Over the course of history, abuse of the term has led to medical atrocities. Familiarity with the relevant bioethical issues and the development of practical guidelines might improve clinical performance. Objective: To define philosophical concepts, to present historical events, to discuss the relevant attitudes in modern bioethics and law that may be helpful in elaborating practical guidelines for clinicians regarding euthanasia and end-of-life care. Concepts found in the classic sources of Jewish tradition might shed additional light on the issue and help clinicians in their decision-making process. Methods: An historical overview defines the concepts of active versus passive euthanasia, physician-assisted suicide and related terms. Positions found in classical Jewish literature are presented and analyzed with their later interpretations. The relevance and application in modern clinical medicine of both the general and Jewish approaches are discussed. Results: The overview of current bioethical concepts demonstrates the variety of approaches in western culture and legal systems. Philosophically and conceptually, there is a crucial distinction between active and passive euthanasia. The legitimacy of active euthanasia has been the subject of major controversy in recent times in various countries and religious traditions. Conclusion: The historical overview and the literature review demonstrate the need to provide clearer definitions of the concepts relating to euthanasia, for in the past the term has led to major confusion and uncontrolled abuse. Bioethical topics should, therefore, be included in medical training and continuing education. There are major debates and controversies regarding the current clinical and legal approaches. We trust that classical Jewish sources might contribute to the establishment of clinical definitions, meaningful approaches and practical guidelines for clinicians.

AB This article reviews evaluation studies of interventions aimed at preventing and reducing incidents of suicide and self-harm among incarcerated individuals. Study design, sample characteristics, intervention procedures, study measures, and relevant results of each study are reviewed. The outcomes of interest include severity and frequency of self-harm episodes and suicidal ideation, scores on adaptive coping methods, scoring on the Beck Hopelessness scale and risk scores. The six evaluated studies are peer-reviewed, published between 1990 and 2015, and took place in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Pakistan. Treatment modalities widely vary across studies and include cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavioral therapy, peer programming, staff intervention training, and uniquely-designed courses that incorporate various aspects from other treatment modalities. Due to the nature of the studies, only one multi-randomized controlled trial was identified. All identified studies had a pre- and post-treatment design either lacking a comparison group or containing 1-2 comparison groups and conduct follow-up of varying times. While Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) interventions and uniquely-tailored intervention programs suggest promising results, the general absence of comparison groups, the shortage of relevant evaluation studies and the inconsistency of behavioral outcome measurements compromise the capacity of this review. Further, definitional variances, particularly for self-injury (self-harm, non-suicidal self-injury [NSSI], deliberate self-harm, suicidal behavior, etc.) affect the ability to synthesize study results. This article aims to synthesize the literature results to identify the most effective interventions that would benefit from additional research.

AB Compared to the general population, military personnel are particularly vulnerable to developing gambling problems. The present study examined the presentation of gambling-including gambling frequency, personal thoughts on reducing gambling and recommendations from others to reduce gambling-across these populations. Additionally, the study measured the association between gambling and various psychosocial risk and protective factors-including psychological distress, suicidal ideation, external encouragement to reduce substance use, days out of role, personal wellbeing, resilience, social support and intimate bonds. Data was extracted from the Global Health & Wellbeing Survey, an online self-report survey conducted in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. Of the 10,765 eligible respondents, 394 were military veterans and 337 were active military personnel. Consistent with previous research, a higher proportion of gambling behaviours were observed in both current and ex-serving military samples, compared to the general population. To varying degrees, significant associations were found between the different gambling items and all psychosocial risk and protective factors in the general population sample. However, the military sample yielded only one significant association between gambling frequency and the protective factor 'resilience'. A post hoc stepwise linear regression analysis demonstrated the possible mediating role resilience plays between gambling frequency and other psychosocial risk (psychological distress, and suicidal thoughts and behaviour) and protective factors (personal wellbeing) for the military sample. Given the findings, it is recommended that routine screening tools identifying problem gambling are used within the military, and subsequent resilience focused interventions are offered to at risk personnel.

TI Homicide and geographic access to gun dealers in the United States
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH

DT Article
ID UNINTENTIONAL FIREARM DEATHS; PUBLIC-HEALTH; SUICIDE; HANDGUN;
   AVAILABILITY; OWNERSHIP; RATES; HOME
AB Background: Firearms are the most commonly used weapon to commit homicide in the U. S. Virtually all firearms enter the public marketplace through a federal firearms licensee (FFL): a store or individual licensed by the federal government to sell firearms. Whether FFLs contribute to gun-related homicide in areas where they are located, in which case FFLs may be a homicide risk factor that can be modified, is not known.
   Methods: Annual county-level data (1993-1999) on gun homicide rates and rates of FFLs per capita were analyzed using negative binomial regression controlling for socio-demographic characteristics. Models were run to evaluate whether the relation between rates of FFLs and rates of gun homicide varied over the study period and across counties according to their level of urbanism (defined by four groupings, as below). Also, rates of FFLs were compared against FS/S - which is the proportion of suicides committed by firearm and is thought to be a good proxy for firearm availability in a region - to help evaluate how well the FFL variable is serving as a way to proxy firearm availability in each of the county types of interest.
   Results: In major cities, gun homicide rates were higher where FFLs were more prevalent (rate ratio [RR] = 1.70, 95% CI 1.03-2.81). This association increased (p < 0.01) from 1993 (RR = 1.69) to 1999 (RR = 12.72), due likely to federal reforms that eliminated low-volume dealers, making FFL prevalence a more accurate exposure measure over time. No association was found in small towns. In other cities and in suburbs, gun homicide rates were significantly lower where FFLs were more prevalent, with associations that did not change over the years of the study period. FFL prevalence was correlated strongly (positively) with FS/S in major cities only, suggesting that the findings for how FFL prevalence relates to gun homicide may be valid for the findings pertaining to major cities but not to counties of other types.
   Conclusion: Modification of FFLs through federal, state, and local regulation may be a feasible intervention to reduce gun homicide in major cities.

AB BackgroundPediatric firearm-related deaths and injuries are a serious societal problem. Our study's objective was to determine social workers' assessment of child neglect with respect to access or potential access to a loaded firearm.MethodsStudy invitations were delivered by e-mail to National Association of Social Workers members designating their practice as "Child/Family Welfare" (N=4933) in October/November, 2015. Demographics, attitudes regarding child access prevention (CAP) laws, and the ages (4-14years) at which social workers deemed several scenarios as child neglect were determined. Descriptive (frequencies) and bivariate (chi square) analyses were performed.Results485 of 4933 social workers completed the survey (9.8%). Of these, most agreed or strongly agreed (>= 92%) there should be laws in place requiring firearms to be stored so unwanted access cannot be obtained by a child, even up to 15years of age. In a scenario where a child had potential access to a loaded firearm, but never gained access, the presence of a CAP law pertinent to the child in the scenario increased the likelihood respondents would find the situation child neglect for all ages (p<0.0001 for each age comparison). Moreover, 10.3% felt they could not deem the situation child neglect without the presence of a CAP law, no matter the age of the child. In a scenario where a child gained access to a loaded firearm, the vast majority found this to be child neglect (82-99%, with the percentage varying by the age of the child involved), regardless of the presence or absence of a CAP law and/or an injury being sustained. In addition, when a CAP law was in place, social workers were more likely to find neglect if the child had sustained a firearm-related injury as well (p values ranged from 0.016-0.0081 for age comparisons).ConclusionsThe vast majority of child/family welfare social workers surveyed found it to be child neglect when youth accessed or had potential access to a loaded, unsecured firearm. Results of the study provide support for the passage of universal CAP laws to help protect children equally across states and ensure the safe storage of firearms in homes.

AB The goal of this study was to determine the risk of homicide victimization associated with an underlying pattern of hazardous drinking. Data were from the Izhevsk Family Study (IFS), a large-scale, population-based case-control study. There were two sets of cases: all men aged 25 to 54 years living in Izhevsk during October 2003 through October 2005 who were (1) homicide victims (n = 45) or (2) homicide victims or died of injuries of undetermined intent (n = 156). Controls were selected at random from a population register. The exposure, an ongoing pattern of hazardous alcohol consumption, was variously defined as drinking more than 20 liters of ethanol in the prior year, consumption of non-beverage alcohols at least once per week, and a set of behavioral measures of problematic drinking. Extensive information was obtained via interviews with proxy informants living in the same household as cases and controls. Each measure of hazardous drinking was associated with increased risk of violent death, and nearly 60 percent of homicides were attributable to hazardous drinking. Results provide strong evidence of an association between an underlying pattern of hazardous drinking and vulnerability to violent death.

AB Background: Terminal illness imposes substantial burdens-economic and otherwise-on patients and caregivers. The cause of these burdens is not understood.
   Objective: To determine the mechanism for economic and noneconomic burdens of terminal illness and to identify potential ameliorating interventions.
   Design: In-person interviews of terminally ill patients and their caregivers.
   Setting: Six randomly selected U.S. sites: Worcester, Massachusetts; St. Louis, Missouri; Tucson, Arizona; Birmingham, Alabama; Brooklyn, New York; and Mesa County, Colorado.
   Participants: 988 terminally ill patients and 893 caregivers.
   Measurements: Needs for transportation, nursing care, homemaking, and personal care; subjective perception of economic burden; expenditure of more than 10% of household income on health care costs; caregiver depression and sense of interference with his or her life; and patient consideration of euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide.
   Results: Of all patients, 34.7% had substantial care needs. Patients who had substantial care needs were more likely to report that they had a subjective sense of economic burden (44.9% compared with 35.3%; difference, 9.6 percentage points [95% CI, 3.1 to 16.1]; P = 0.005); that 10% of their household income was spent on health care (28.0% compared with 17.0%; difference, 11.0 percentage points [CI, 4.8 to 17.1]; P less than or equal to 0.001); and that they or their families had to take out a loan or mortgage, spend their savings, or obtain an additional job (16.3% compared with 10.2%; difference, 6.1 percentage points [CI, 1.4 to 10.6]; P = 0.004). Patients with substantial care needs were more likely to consider euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (P = 0.001). Caregivers of these patients were more likely to have depressive symptoms (31.4% compared with 24.8%; difference, 6.6 percentage points [CI, 0.4 to 12.8]; P = 0.01) and to report that caring for the patients interfered with their lives (35.6% compared with 24.3%; difference, 11.3 percentage points [CI, 5.0 to 17.7]; P = 0.001). Caregivers of patients whose physicians listened to patients' and caregivers' needs had fewer burdens.
   Conclusions: Substantial care needs are an important cause of the economic and other burdens imposed by terminal illness. Through empathy, physicians may be able to ameliorate some of these burdens.

   DEPRESSION; DEINSTITUTIONALIZATION
AB Background. - Schizophrenia is characterized by profound disruption in cognition and emotion, affecting the most fundamental human attributes: language, thought, perception, affect and sense of self. The clinical picture is further complicated by the multiple secondary consequences of the disorder; notably disrupted education, unemployment, impoverished social relationships, isolation, legal difficulties, family stress and substance abuse. Not surprisingly, the disorder is also associated with suicidal behaviour. The management of schizophrenia is thus extremely difficult with high rates of relapse, treatment refusal and poor treatment outcome. In Europe and the United States there has been a general trend towards decreasing the former long duration of hospital care in favour of short-term pharmacological stabilization in the hospital setting, followed by longer multidisciplinary follow-up within the community. This change reflects, on the one hand, the evolution in aetiological conceptions towards a predominantly neurobiological model of the disorder, with complex social consequences and also social and economic constraints. The clinical consequences of these changes were not, however, evaluated prior to the implementation of these changes.
   Literature findings. - Several studies have shown a clear relationship between reductions in duration of stay and increases in readmission rates and suggest that the development of community services may not in fact significantly improve clinical outcome, and may also possibly increase relapse rates due to the instability of the clinical condition at first discharge. There has been some unsettling evidence to suggest that shortening hospital stays may not be a general panacea. Authors reported in 1999 that deinstitutionalization policies in Denmark had led to premature discharge and subsequently a 100% increase in suicide, a doubling of the rates of criminal acts committed by psychotic patients, and increases of 80 to 100% in acute admission rates. A large follow-up study of psychotic patients in the USA found that hospital stays of less than 14 days were significantly associated with increased suicide risk; on the other hand, shortening hospital stays appears to be linked to higher rates of care satisfaction.
   Conclusion. - Indeed, studies of patients returning to the community compared to those remaining in institutions show not only better quality of life and larger friendship networks, but also reductions in dependence on pharmacotherapy and lower mortality rates. The essential question of whether shortened hospital care may lead to premature discharge or, on the other hand, decreased patient dependency and social deviance, has not been adequately addressed.

Previous research has examined the impact of some alcohol-related policies on youth alcohol use and alcohol-related harm in the United States but findings have been mixed. To our knowledge, no study has provided a detailed epidemiology of the relationship between the impacts of alcohol policies on unintentional injury in Illinois. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine whether a legislation that prohibit minors under 21years old in establishments that serve alcohol is more salient than individual level factors in predicting hospitalization for traumatic unintentional injuries.MethodsA retrospective observational study of data abstracted from 6,139 patients aged 10 to 19 hospitalized in Illinois Level I and Level II trauma centers. Patient data from 2006 to 2015 was linked with the city-level alcohol-related legislation (n=514 cities). The response variable was whether a patient tested positive or negative for blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of admission. Mixed-effects logistic regression analyses were conducted to model the patient and city level legislation effect of having a positive BAC test result on hospitalizations after adjusting for the legislation and patient factors.ResultsAfter adjustment, patients aged 15 to 19 and white patients who tested positive for BAC at the time of admission had the greater odds of hospitalization for traumatic alcohol-related unintentional injuries compared to patients who had a negative BAC test result. However, odds of hospitalization decreased for female patients and for those with private insurance, and over time, but a significant decrease in such hospitalizations occurred during 2010, 2014 and 2015. The alcohol-related legislation of interest was not a significant predictor of traumatic alcohol-related unintentional injury hospitalization.ConclusionsPatient-level covariates were significant predictors of traumatic alcohol-related unintentional injury hospitalization; an alcohol-related legislation may not reduce hospitalizations for young patients aged 10 to 19. Therefore, to prevent underage drinking and consequences, interventions should target sex/gender, race/ethnicity and focus on both individual and environmental strategies.

AB Background: Much of the research on suicidality has focused on adolescents and completed suicides, with less attention to types of suicidal behavior (ideation and attempts) that are more common among women. Research has associated women's suicidality with hazardous drinking, adverse childhood experiences, relationship problems, depression, and earlier suicidal behavior. The longitudinal analyses here examine long-term antecedents of suicidal ideation among women in the U.S. general population.
   Methods: We used 1981 and 1991 survey data to predict post-1991 suicidal ideation in a 1996 national sample of 709 women aged 26 to 54 (538 current drinkers). Predictors included 1991 measures of hazardous drinking, depressive episodes, illicit drug use, general health, children at home, interaction with partner, and previous suicidal ideation. Predictors from childhood included recalled parental drinking, parental love or rejection, early drinking and sexual intercourse, and sexual abuse. Demographic predictors included age, education, and ethnicity. A three-stage structural equation model that included these variables was evaluated with Mplus for women who were drinkers in 1991 and/or 1996.
   Results: Almost all women who attempted suicide also reported suicidal ideation. Among women drinkers, suicidal ideation before 1991 was more common in the following groups: Latinas, women who believed that their parents had rejected them, and women who reported childhood sexual abuse. Hazardous drinking and poorer health in 1991, childhood histories of sexual abuse and early drinking, and previous suicidal ideation predicted suicidal ideation after 1991. Domestic stressors in 1991 (inability to share feelings with a partner and having four or more young children at home) also predicted subsequent suicidal ideation, but depressive episodes did not. Suicidal ideation was less likely among women drinkers who reported past illicit drug use.
   Conclusions: Suicidal ideation among women drinkers was largely predictable from previous suicidal ideation, hazardous drinking, adverse childhood experiences, and domestic stressors. Higher rates of pre-1991 suicidal ideation among Latinas indicate a need for further study of ethnic influences on suicidality. Reduced suicidal ideation among women with past illicit drug use suggests that conclusions about such use from shorter-term studies may be oversimplified. Understanding women's suicidal ideation, as a precursor to suicidal actions, requires more detailed research on pathways by which hazardous drinking as well as combined distress from childhood experiences and adult domestic environments may increase women's despair and thoughts of suicide.

TI Can Emergency Department, Hospital Discharge, and Death Data Be Used to
   Monitor Burden of Drug Overdose in Rhode Island?
SO JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE

DT Article

   discharge data; Rhode Island
AB Context: Drug overdoses are a growing public health problem in the United States. Rhode Island is also confronted with a serious epidemic of drug overdose deaths and ranks sixth worst in the United States for age-adjusted drug overdose death rate.
   Objective: To monitor trends of drug overdose-related emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and deaths and classify the drug overdoses by demographics, discharge status, intent, and specific drug involved to plan for health care resource allocation, mental health services, drug abuse treatment, prevention, and policies.
   Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Setting: The 2005-2014 ED, hospital discharge, and death data were used for this study.
   Main Outcome Measure: Age-adjusted rates were calculated by using age-specific Rhode Island 2010 standard population. Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project cost-to-charge ratios were used to convert total hospital charges to costs. The descriptive analysis was performed.
   Results: Hospitalizations generally represent the most severe cases; there are substantially fewer cases than are seen in the ED, and their characteristics are different from ED visits. More than half of the ED cases were an unintentional injury by drug overdose, but more than half of the hospital discharge data cases were a suicide/self-inflicted injury by drug overdose. There were typically much more females than males that result in a hospital admission. In Rhode Island, there were 249 drug overdose deaths in 2014. Drug overdose fatalities were more likely to be young, male, white, and those who reside in suburban regions.
   Implications: Nonfatal and fatal drug overdose data are important for understanding the scope, incidence, and breadth of this public health epidemic and can guide overdose intervention efforts. In Rhode Island, policy makers can use drug overdose data to target high-risk subpopulations to reduce overdose injuries and fatalities. The Rhode Island study can be shared with other states.
   Conclusions: Regardless of the type of drug, overdoses remain a public health crisis in Rhode Island. It is a dynamic epidemic and needs partnership among public health, behavioral health, public safety, clinic, pharmacy, and communities. The ability to track drug overdose in real time will be an essential tool to respond to the constantly evolving drug overdose epidemic in Rhode Island quickly and effectively.

AB Mental health care personnel have one of the highest rates of workplace violence of any occupational class in the United States, with psychiatric aides having a rate that is 69 times higher than the national mean; furthermore, aggression on the part of psychiatric patients that targets other patients is a substantial component of morbidity and even mortality rates in inpatient psychiatric institutions. Much research has focused on such topics as the demographic characteristics of staff most likely to be victimized and the identification of patients most likely to become aggressive, but very little attention has been devoted to the temporal architecture of aggressive behavior. This study examined the temporal patterning of violent and aggressive behavior on an inpatient psychiatric ward over a one-year period. A statistical analysis of these data indicated that events occurred in a nonrandom fashion, with evidence to support the contention that periodic 'bursts' of aggression occurred in a manner that could be labeled a 'contagion' effect. Additional analyses indicated that (1) certain types of aggressive behaviors were more likely to kindle or trigger contagion events, and; (2) certain patients were more likely to kindle others to behave violently.

AB American Indian/Alaska Native youth represent the strength and continued survival of many Nations and Tribes. However, they currently experience numerous health disparities and challenges, including the highest rate of suicide among 15-24 year-olds in the United States. Our comprehensive review of the literature on the mental health of AI/AN youth highlighted seven focal causes of behavioral health disparities: (1) high levels of violence and trauma exposure and traumatic loss, (2) past and current oppression, racism, and discrimination, (3) underfunded systems of care, (4) disregard for effective indigenous practices in service provision, policy, and funding, (5) overreliance on evidence-based practices, (6) lack of cultural competence among systems of care and providers, and (7) barriers to care. Seven policy recommendations that recognize the importance of moving beyond exclusive reliance on western models of care and that seek to foster transformation of individuals, families, communities, behavioral health service systems of care, and social structures are presented, supported, and discussed.

AB Objectives. We determined racial/ethnic differences in social support and exposure to violence and transphobia, and explored correlates of depression among male-to-female transgender women with a history of sex work (THSW).
   Methods. A total of 573 THSW who worked or resided in San Francisco or Oakland, California, were recruited through street outreach and referrals and completed individual interviews using a structured questionnaire.
   Results. More than half of Latina and White participants were depressed on the basis of Center For Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale scores. About three quarters of White participants reported ever having suicidal ideation, of whom 64% reported suicide attempts. Half of the participants reported being physically assaulted, and 38% reported being raped or sexually assaulted before age 18 years. White and African American participants reported transphobia experiences more frequently than did others. Social support, transphobia, suicidal ideation, and levels of income and education were significantly and independently correlated with depression.
   Conclusions. For THSW, psychological vulnerability must be addressed in counseling, support groups, and health promotion programs specifically tailored to race/ethnicity. (Am J Public Health. 2011;101:1980-1988. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2010.197285)

AB Introduction: The characteristics of Asian American and white problem gamblers using a gambling helpline were examined to identify race-related differences.
   Methods: Logistic regression analyses were conducted on data obtained from callers to a gambling helpline serving southern New England in 2000-2003, inclusive.
   Results: Of the 144 phone calls used in the analyses, 72 were from Asian American callers and 72 were from white callers who were matched on gender, education, income, marital/cohabitation status, and age. Race-related differences were observed in forms of gambling problems, psychiatric problems secondary to gambling, substance use problems, and family history. Asian American gamblers were more likely to report suicide attempts related to gambling and problems with non-strategic gambling. White gamblers were more likely to report both casino and non-casino gambling problems and personal and familial alcohol use problems. High proportions of both groups reported problems with strategic gambling, gambling-related anxiety, family and financial problems secondary to gambling, financial debt, daily tobacco use, and a family history of problem gambling.
   Conclusion: Race-related differences should be considered in optimizing prevention and treatment strategies related to problem gambling.

AB In recent years, drug abuse shows an obvious tendency of diversification and becoming younger, and teenagers' drug abuse has become one of the serious public health problems in the world. In this paper, the situation and influencing factors of teenagers' drug abuse were summarized according to the existing research. It is of significant importance to the teenagers' drug abuse prevention and correction, and also to provide evidence for preventive policy.
   In recent years, diversity of drug abuse tends to be more diverse and younger, and drug abuse among young people has become one of the serious public health problems in the world. It is due to the fact that teenagers' physiology and psychology are on the developing stage and they are affected easily by various factors, adolescence is a crucial period for a person's growth. Teenagers' drug abuse will cause serious bodily damage, psychological problems such as depression and suicide, or even produce all kinds of criminal acts, and lead to huge social problems. Therefore, understanding the status quo and influencing factors of drug abuse among adolescents could provide scientific basis for government making the relative policy.

   STAFF
AB Study objective: Workplace violence in health care settings is a frequent occurrence. Emergency departments (EDs) are considered particularly vulnerable. Gunfire in hospitals is of particular concern; however, information about such workplace violence is limited. Therefore, we characterize US hospital-based shootings from 2000 to 2011.
   Methods: Using LexisNexis, Google, Netscape, PubMed, and ScienceDirect, we searched reports for acute care hospital shooting events in the United States for 2000 through 2011. All hospital-based shootings with at least 1 injured victim were analyzed.
   Results: Of 9,360 search "hits," 154 hospital-related shootings were identified, 91 (59%) inside the hospital and 63 (41%) outside on hospital grounds. Shootings occurred in 40 states, with 235 injured or dead victims. Perpetrators were overwhelmingly men (91%) but represented all adult age groups. The ED environs were the most common site (29%), followed by the parking lot (23%) and patient rooms (19%). Most events involved a determined shooter with a strong motive as defined by grudge (27%), suicide (21%), "euthanizing" an ill relative (14%), and prisoner escape (11%). Ambient society violence (9%) and mentally unstable patients (4%) were comparatively infrequent. The most common victim was the perpetrator (45%). Hospital employees composed 20% of victims; physician (3%) and nurse (5%) victims were relatively infrequent. Event characteristics that distinguished the ED from other sites included younger perpetrator, more likely in custody, and unlikely to have a personal relationship with the victim (ill relative, grudge, coworker). In 23% of shootings within the ED, the weapon was a security officer's gun taken by the perpetrator. Case fatality inside the hospital was much lower in the ED setting (19%) than other sites (73%).
   Conclusion: Although it is likely that not every hospital-based shooting was identified, such events are relatively rare compared with other forms of workplace violence. The unpredictable nature of this type of event represents a significant challenge to hospital security and effective deterrence practices because most perpetrators proved determined and a significant number of shootings occur outside the hospital building.

TI The Ambiguous Practices of the Inauthentic Asian American Woman
SO HYPATIA-A JOURNAL OF FEMINIST PHILOSOPHY
LA English
DT Article
AB The Asian American identity is intimately associated with upward class mobility as the model minority, yet women's earnings remain less than men's, and Asian American women are perceived to have strong family ties binding them to domestic responsibilities. As such, the exact class status of Asian American women is unclear. The immediate association of this ethnic identity with a specific class as demonstrated by the recently released Pew study that Asian Americans are the highest-income, best-educated ethnicity contrasts with another study that finds Asian American women have the highest suicide rates in the United States. To understand these contrasting statistics, this article explores Asian American women's sense of authenticity. If the individual's sense of authenticity is intimately related with one's group identity, the association of the Asian American identity with a particular class ambivalently ensnares her as dichotomously inauthenticas both the poor Asian American woman who fails to achieve economic upward mobility and the model minority Asian American woman who engages in assimilation practices. Feminist philosophers understand that identities change, but exactly how these transformations occur remains a mystery. The article ends with three speculations on the difficulties for practicing and recognizing individual acts that transform one's group identity.

   BEREAVEMENT; POPULATION; MORBIDITY; ACCURACY; MARRIAGE; SUICIDE
AB Objectives. We investigated the effect of spousal bereavement on mortality to document cause-specific bereavement effects by the causes of death of both the predecedent spouse and the bereaved partner.
   Methods. We obtained data from a nationally representative cohort of 373189 elderly married couples in the United States who were followed from 1993 to 2002. We used competing risk and Cox models in our analyses.
   Results. For both men and women, the death of a predecedent spouse from almost all causes, including various cancers, infections, and cardiovascular diseases, increased the all-cause mortality of the bereaved partner to varying degrees. Moreover, the death of a predecedent spouse from any cause increased the survivor's cause-specific mortality for almost all causes, including cancers, infections, and cardiovascular diseases, to varying degrees.
   Conclusions. The effect of widowhood on mortality varies substantially by the causes of death of both spouses, suggesting that the widowhood effect is not restricted to one aspect of human biology. Future research should examine the specific mechanisms of the widowhood effect and identify opportunities for health interventions.

AB Objectives: Religion and spirituality provide the means by which many individuals and their families cope with illness. Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that health outcomes may be influenced by patients' religious beliefs, attitudes, and behavior.
   Methods: We examined three representative nonspecialty journals (Journal of the American Medical Association, Lancet, and the New England Journal of Medicine) between 1998 and 2000 for references to the role of religion/spirituality. Of the 2,385 studies found, only 20 (0.8%) examined some aspect of spirituality (n = 5), religion (n = 13), or both (n = 2). Spirituality was treated as a dependent variable in all seven articles in which it was studied.
   Results: The effect of religion was analyzed in 11 of the 15 articles in which it was measured, and its effect was statistically significant in 8 of the 11 studies in which it was analyzed.
   Conclusions: Although religious variables were a key element of most of the studies in which they were measured, overall, little attention appears to be paid to these concepts in general medical journals, even though they may be useful for refining outcomes research.

AB This study brings together 2 case studies to interrogate the intersectional experiences of historically marginalized youth at the intersections of power and identity from a decolonizing mental health disability studies in education (DSE) cripstemology approach. Specifically, we analyzed how US schools create normalized meanings of mental health. Daniel was a 1st-generation Mexican American to the United States, bilingual in both Spanish and English, and was labeled with a learning disability and a speech and language impairment. Daniel was born in Pinole, a southwestern major urban city and was in the 8th grade. Luna, a 16-year-old 10th-grader who lived at home with his mother and his stepfather and identifies as an Arab American, was on an individual education program for his disabilities including mild cerebral palsy, apraxia, and dysarthria. Luna identified as a pansexual and transgender individual and experiences depression and suicide ideation. There were similarities and differences between Daniel and Luna's experiences related to intersectional disability oppressions that were interpersonal and institutional, their identity processes around school contexts tied to their ethnicities, language use, sexuality, and their experiences with colonial mental health hegemony. Our framework created new knowledge for theory, research, and praxis within US schools.

AB Purpose of ReviewPatients with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD) are often suspected of malingering or exaggerating symptoms, though there is no clear evidence that they do so more than other patients. We review the manifestations, etiology, and management of seemingly feigned symptoms in these disorders, particularly related to their presentation in the emergency department (ED).Recent FindingsIt is dangerous to assume that all patients with ASPD and BPD are intentionally feigning symptoms in the ED. However, when ASPD patients are known to be malingering, the focus should be shifted to addressing the motivation behind malingering and the patient's true goals, ideally done with a curious rather than confrontational approach. BPD patients also may appear to be malingering or exaggerating symptoms, but their presentation often is more accurately attributed to the lack of ability to mentalize and effectively communicate their needs, as well as emotional hypochondriasis.SummaryEducation of ED staff, demonstrating genuine concern, and attempting to find a common goal with patients will aid in keeping an objective view of the patient's distress, minimizing escalation, and optimizing patient outcomes.

AB There is a risk of experiencing clinical burnout among therapists providing treatment to clients with borderline personality disorder (BPD), a complex, costly and difficult-to-treat psychiatric disorder. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is an evidence-based treatment of BPD that has been widely disseminated. There is only one published study that has examined pre and post scores of burnout among clinicians who receive training in DBT, and none that have taken place within a public behavioral health system in the United States where resources for community-based agencies are limited and demands are high. The current study examined the rates of burnout among therapists treating clients with BPD within a large, urban public behavioral health system. The study included a sample of nine clinicians and showed significantly decreased scores of burnout after participants attended a series of DBT trainings over a period of 13 months. There were several key limitations to internal validity including the lack of a control group. Similar evaluations of training outcomes are needed to address the widespread occurrence of burnout among community-based clinicians providing treatment to clients with BPD in order to enhance the quality of patient care.

AB Objectives. We examined how early life conditions influence midlife overall and cause-specific mortality in a community cohort of disadvantaged African Americans.
   Methods. Using a prospective design, we assessed first-grade children and their teachers and families when children were 6 years old, with follow-up at ages 16, 32, and 42 years. We obtained information on death from family members, neighbors, and the National Death Index (NDI). We conducted a survival analysis and competing risk analysis to examine early life predictors of mortality.
   Results. Of 1242 participants, 87 (7%) had died by 2004. In multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression, males who lived in foster care and females with lower math grades in first grade were more likely to die by age 42 years. In multivariate competing risks analysis, hospitalization by the time of first grade was related to mortality from acute and chronic illness. Male gender, being in foster care, and aggressive behavior in first grade were related to mortality from drug use, violence, or suicide.
   Conclusions. Early classroom, environmental, and family-level interventions are potentially beneficial in reducing later overall and cause-specific mortality.

AB The goal of this study was to examine differences between Latino individuals with anxiety disorder diagnoses that include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and those with anxiety disorders without PTSD, in regards to comorbidity, psychosocial impairment, physical functioning, and treatment participation. The sample consisted of 150 adult Latinos participating in the Harvard/Brown Anxiety Research Project-Phase-II (HARP-II). Participants had at least one of the anxiety disorders included in the study (generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder with and without agoraphobia, social phobia, and/or PTSD). Forty-five (30%) participants had PTSD which was lower than rates of generalized anxiety disorder (n = 90, 60%), social anxiety (n = 86, 57.3%), and panic disorder with agoraphobia (n = 83, 55.3%), and higher than panic disorder without agoraphobia, (n = 10, 6.6%). Those with PTSD compared with those with other anxiety disorders had a statistically significant higher number of comorbid Axis I diagnoses, higher rates of psychiatric hospitalizations, and poorer overall social adjustment than participants with other anxiety disorders. Clinical implications for assessment and treatment planning of Latino individuals with anxiety disorders are discussed.

AB This study explored the feasibility of using Internet social networking media in an online program for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) screening and psychoeducation targeting college students. A Facebook advertisement targeted students at five colleges in the United States to complete a mental health research survey that screened for MDD using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Students who screened positive for MDD were offered an eight-week follow-up survey. Of the 259 students who consented to participate in the study, 26.7% screened positive for MDD, while only 14.2% were receiving treatment. The use of Facebook to advertise for online screening for MDD required very little start-up time, and the average cost was $11.45 per subject recruited. It is feasible to use online, commercially available social networking media such as Facebook for online screening for MDD among college students. However, conducting online screening and offering treatment resources alone did not increase treatment rate in this population. (C) 2012 Asociacion Espanola de Psicologia Conductual.

AB Pantoea ananatis, a cause of center rot of onion, is problematic in the United States and elsewhere. The bacterium lacks disease determinants common to most other bacterial pathogens of plants. A genomic island containing the gene pepM was detected within many onion-pathogenic strains of P. ananatis of diverse origins. The pepMgene of P. ananatis putatively encodes a protein that converts phosphoenolpyruvate to phosphonopyruvate, the first step in the biosynthesis of phosphonates and related molecules. This gene appears to be essential for center rot disease. Deletion of pepM rendered the mutant strain unable to cause lesions in leaves of growing onions and water-soaking of inoculated yellow onion bulbs. Furthermore, growth of the deletion mutant in onion leaves was significantly diminished compared with wild-type bacteria, and the mutant failed to cause cell death in tobacco. Complementation of the mutated strain with pepM restored the phenotype to wild-type capability. The pepM gene is the first pathogenicity factor identified that affects bacterial fitness as well as symptom development in both leaves and bulbs in a pathogen causing center rot of onion.

AB Background: Despite the well-established link between exposure to violence and mental health problems, less is known about this association among college students. The current study aimed to investigate the association between history of exposure to violence and mental health of American college students. Methods: Healthy Mind Study (HMS, 2016-2017) is a national online survey of 41,898 adult college students. The independent variable was lifetime history of exposure to violence (psychological, physical, and sexual). The dependent variables were anxiety, depression, and suicidality. Race, age, gender, sexual orientation, parental education, financial stress, transfer status, enrollment status, and graduate status were covariates. Linear and logistic regression models were used for data analysis. Results: History of exposure to violence was associated with all three aspects of poor mental health, namely general anxiety, depression, and suicidality. These associations were independent of covariates and type of abuse. Conclusions: There is a need to address various mental health needs of college students who have experienced various forms of violence. College students who screen positive for history of violence exposure should be evaluated for anxiety, depression, and suicidal behaviors.

AB Objectives. To assess the prevalence of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and their association with behavioral health in American Indian (AI) and non-AI populations in South Dakota. Methods. We included the validated ACE questionnaire in a statewide health survey of 16,001 households. We examined the prevalence of ACEs and behavioral health conditions in AI and non-AI populations and associations between ACEs and behavioral health. Results. Compared with non-AIs, AIs displayed higher prevalence of ACEs including abuse, neglect, and household dysfunction and had a higher total number of ACEs. For AIs and non-AIs, having six or more ACEs significantly increased the odds for depression, anxiety, PTSD, severe alcohol misuse, and smoking compared with individuals with no ACEs. Conclusions. American Indians in South Dakota experience more ACEs, which may contribute to poor behavioral health. Preventing and mitigating the effects of ACEs may have a significant impact on health disparities in AI populations.

AB In the United States, depression affects up to 9 percent of patients and accounts for more than $43 billion in medical care costs. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening in adolescents and adults in clinical practices that have systems in place to ensure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and follow-up. It does not recommend for or against screening for depression in children seven to 11 years of age or screening for suicide risk in the general population. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-2 and PHQ-9 are commonly used and validated screening tools. The PHQ-2 has a 97 percent sensitivity and 67 percent specificity in adults, whereas the PHQ-9 has a 61 percent sensitivity and 94 percent specificity in adults. If the PHQ-2 is positive for depression, the PHQ-9 should be administered; in older adults, the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale is also an appropriate follow-up test. If these screening tests are positive for depression, further evaluation is needed to confirm that the patient's symptoms meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders' criteria for diagnosis.

AB Purpose: To identify the risk involvement of three KEY WORDS groups of young people with disabilities relative to a Adolescents comparison group: mobility impairments, learning disabilities abilities, and emotional disabilities. Protective factors are Risk behav explored to identify which individual, family, and school factors are associated with diminished risk.
   Methods: Analyses are based on the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), a nationally representative sample of 20,780 seventh through 12(th)-grade youth in the United States. Five negative health outcomes were studied: suicide attempts, sexual abuse, regular cigarette smoker, alcohol use, rind marijuana use. For bivariate analyses Student's t-test and Chi-square were used, and logistic regressions were performed on all dichotomized dependent variables.
   Results: For most risk behaviors studied, youth with disabilities were more involved than peers. Factors that predisposed to risk varied little between those with and without disabilities. Likewise, there was substantial consistency between groups as to protective factors. What distinguished each group of young people with disabilities from peers is that they reported significantly more exposure to risk factors and significantly fewer protective factors.

AB The purpose of this qualitative, retrospective study, was to examine leisure as a context for identity formation among young people (aged 18-22) who self-identified as lesbian/gay while in high school. Phenomenology was the theoretical framework that guided the conceptualization, interviews, and data analysis for this study: Ten participants from the southeastern United States were asked to reflect on their experiences of leisure and the ways in which leisure contexts helped them to negotiate their understanding of themselves and their relationships,with others. Although the purpose of the study was nor to develop a global, explanatory model about lesbian/growth, leisure, nob identity: we did, nevertheless, develop overarching themes that describe and grounded theory that explains the role of leisure in the process of identity formation in the lives of these participants. The four themes-reading myself, seeing myself: media consumption; playing myself: sports; and expressing myself: music-led to the conclusion that the influence of leisure contexts in terms of the integration of personal and social identity formation was mitigated by the extent to which young people felt the need to conceal their sexual identity.

AB Objectives. We examined the prevalence and correlates of past-year suicidal ideation among US community-dwelling adults.
   Methods. We examined data from 183 100 persons aged 18 years or older (including 9800 sampled adults with past-year suicidal ideation) who participated in the 2008-2011 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. We applied descriptive analyses and pooled and stratified (by age and major depression) multivariate logistic regression models.
   Results. The prevalence of past-year suicidal ideation among younger adults (6.6% among those aged 18-25 years and 4.0% among those aged 26-49 years) was higher than was that among adults aged 50 years or older (2.5%). The prevalence of suicidal ideation was high among adults with major depression (26.3%), adults with both major depression and substance use disorder (37.7%), and adults who received mental health treatment but perceived unmet treatment need (33.5%).
   Conclusions. Many risk and protective factors of suicidal ideation are dynamic and vary by age or major depression. These results have important implications for developing specific suicide prevention strategies that help screen, assess, and treat suicidal adults at the earliest possible time.

TI The Disastrous First Fund-Raising Campaign in Legal Education: The

SO JOURNAL OF THE GILDED AGE AND PROGRESSIVE ERA
LA English
DT Article
AB Between 1915 and 1925, Harvard University conducted the first national public fund-raising campaign in higher education in the United States. At the same time, Harvard LawSchool attempted the first such effort in legal education. The law school organized its effort independently, in conjunction with its centennial in 1917. The university campaign succeeded magnificently by all accounts; the law school failed miserably. Though perfectly positioned for this new venture, Harvard Law School raised scarcely a quarter of its goal from merely 2 percent of its alumni. This essay presents the first account of this campaign and argues that its failure was rooted in longstanding cultural and professional objections that many of the school's alumni shared: law students and law schools neither need nor deserve benefactions, and such gifts worsen the overcrowding of the bar. Due to these objections, lethargy, apathy, and pessimism suffused the campaign. These factors weakened the leadership of the alumni association, the dean, and the president, leading to inept management, wasted time, and an unlikely strategy that was pursued ineffectively. All this doomed the campaign, particularly given the tragic interruptions of the dean's suicide and World War I, along with competition from the well-run campaigns for the University and for disaster relief due to the war.

AB Objective: Suicide is the second leading cause of death among emerging adults, yet little is known regarding their online help-seeking. Participants: The National Research Consortium of Counseling Centers in Higher Education's dataset (N=26,292). Methods: Students across the United States were recruited from 73 four-year institutions to participate during the 2010-2011 school year. Results: Observed the effectiveness of online and traditional help-seeking stratified by recent suicidal ideation related to their most distressful period in the past year. Females and younger students endorsed both types of help-seeking, yet those with recent ideation were less likely to disclose any help-seeking. Among those reporting recent ideation, only females reported that traditional supports were more than moderately helpful. Regardless of whether students endorsed ideation, students who were younger, engaged in risky behaviors and identified as females reported that online resources were more than moderately helpful. Conclusions: Online resources could potentially bridge barriers to traditional help-seeking for those reluctant to seek out care, yet traditional resources were reported to be the most effective among this sample.

AB New smart-home devices provide the opportunity to advance psychological science and theory through novel research opportunities in home environments. These technologies extend the in vivo research and intervention capabilities afforded by other assessment techniques such as Ecological Momentary Assessment methods as well as mobile and wearable devices. Smart-home devices contain a multitude of sensors capable of continuously and unobtrusively collecting multimodal data within home contexts. These devices have some complementary strengths and limitations compared with other assessment methods. This article (a) briefly reviews data collection methods in home environments, (b) discusses the unique advantages of smart-home devices, (c) describes the extant smart-home literature, (d) explores how these devices may advance evaluation and refinement of psychological theories, (e) describes examples of psychological processes that are potential targets for smart-home assessment and intervention, (f) considers methodological challenges and barriers, (g) discusses ethical considerations, and (h) concludes with a discussion of future directions for research and the merging of passive-sensing technologies with active self-report methods. This article aims to highlight the potential utility of smart-home devices within psychological research to evaluate psychological theories related to behavior within the home context.

AB Infection with HBV and HCV are considered the most important etiological factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Current treatment options are insufficient, creating an urgent need for new therapeutic strategies that inhibit disease progression and improve survival in patients with HCC. A promising strategy for the treatment of HCC is gene therapy (GT), which is characterized by the transduction of tumor cells with genes displaying antitumor properties, such as pro-apoptotic, suicide, anti-angiogenic and immunomodulatory genes, as well as siRNAs. Other GT strategies have investigated oncolytic viral vectors that propagate specifically in tumor cells and, subsequently, kill these malignant cells. Furthermore, GT strategies directed toward halting virus proliferation, such as genetic vaccines or genetic interference with viral replication, as well as strategies that prevent viral induced pre-carcinogenic changes, represent the most efficient strategies to prevent HCC development. These GT approaches are promising alternatives to, and could complement or substitute, current treatment options for HCC. This review summarizes trends in GT during the past decade, including investigations in animal models and patients for the prevention and treatment of hepatitis virus-induced HCC.

   SUICIDE
AB Objective: The movement to limit work hours for house staff has gained momentum in recent years. The authors set out to review the literature on work hours reform, particularly as it applies to psychiatric residency training, and to provide two different viewpoints on the controversy.
   Methods: The authors present the historical background of work hours reform in the United States and review recent literature about resident work hours limitations. Using a debate format, the authors discuss whether the new regulations are having a positive or negative impact on residency training in psychiatry.
   Results: Drs. Lomonaco and Auchincloss argue that currently-existing work hours restrictions may have unintended consequences for the health of patients and an untoward impact on residents' professional development and academic medicine's overall structure. Dr. Rasminsky argues that work hours restrictions do not go far enough in protecting residents and patients from the harmful effects of fatigue, and that our definition of professionalism needs to be reexamined in light of emerging scientific literature.
   Conclusion: There should be some limitation on resident work hours, with exact numbers to be determined by growing scientific knowledge about the effects of prolonged wakefulness. More study is needed, particularly in the area of psychiatric residency training.

AB Major findings of the Survey of Living Conditions in the Arctic (SLiCA) are: (1) A combination of traditional activities and cash employment is the prevailing lifestyle of Arctic indigenous peoples; (2) family ties, social support of each other, and traditional activities have a lot to do with why indigenous people choose to remain in Arctic communities; (3) well-being is closely related to job opportunities, locally available fish and game, and a sense of local control. Well-being and depression (and related problems like suicide) are flip sides of the same coin. Improving well-being may reduce social problems; and, (4) health conditions vary widely in the Arctic: three-in-four Greenlandic Inuit self-rate their health as at least very good compared with one-in-two Canadian and Alaska Inuit and one-in-five Chukotka indigenous people. Findings are based on 7,200 interviews in a probability sample of Inupiat settlement regions of Alaska, the four Inuit settlement regions of Canada, all of Greenland, and the Anadyrskij, Anadyr, Shmidtovs, Beringovskij, Chukotskij, Iujl'tinskij, Bilibinskij, Chaunskij, Providenskij, Uel'Kal' districts of Chukotka. Indigenous people and researchers from Greenland, Russia, Canada, the United States, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland collaborated on all phases of the study.

AB Individuals who identify as transgender or gender nonconforming (TGNC) face a number of health disparities compared to individuals who identify as cisgender (those who self-identify with the sex they were assigned at birth). For example, TGNC individuals experience heightened rates of clinical depression, anxiety, general psychological distress, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts. Despite these troubling disparities, many TGNC individuals report hesitance to seek mental health services due to concerns regarding culturally insensitive or even overtly discriminatory services from providers. In addition to decreasing service utilization among TGNC populations, discriminatory services impair intervention effectiveness even when TGNC individuals persist in seeking mental health services. The American Psychological Association (APA) and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) provide guidelines for culturally competent work with TGNC clients; however, research indicates a profound lack of TGNC-specific training and resources among mental health care providers. To address this gap, the present investigation utilized a mixed-method design to assess training experiences, understanding of terminology, and TGNC competence among mental health care providers at various training levels. Participants were current mental health clinicians across the United States. Implications for improving reported and demonstrated weaknesses are discussed.

AB Affecting more than 1 million youth, student homelessness is growing at an unprecedented rate in the United States. This is alarming because homeless students face significant barriers to their academic success and positive life outcomes. Unfortunately, despite the significant risks and challenges they face, homeless students often are overlooked and not provided with important educational and social-emotional supports. In addition, information on student homelessness is relatively limited in the school psychology literature and practice guidelines, which can forestall efforts to help these students. To date, only a few empirical articles have been published on student homelessness in school psychology journals and in practitioner-related literature. To help address this paucity, this article discusses barriers to the academic success of homeless students, as well as ways to reduce these barriers. Additionally, important protective factors, resilience, and ways to overcome homelessness-related stigma are reviewed. Lastly, ways that school psychologists can become key stakeholders in efforts to help support the academic and life success of homeless students are discussed. The overall goal for this article is to encourage school psychologists to redouble their efforts to support a highly at-risk yet often neglected student population. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This study examined the time trend and pattern of HIV/AIDS-related deaths in China. Data on HIV deaths and AIDS deaths were provided by the Chinese Ministry of Health. Time trend of the overall death rates over the period 2000-2012 was examined using Poisson regression models. Pattern of AIDS deaths was examined for the period 2006-2012, using the age-, gender-, and region-specific death rates. The results indicated that HIV/AIDS-related death rate increased significantly in China over the past decade, with an average annual percentage change of 22.3%. A vast majority of the deaths occurred among those aged between 20 and 65 years, with two age peaks. The death rate was higher for males than females and in rural areas than urban areas. A total of 83% of the deaths occurred among rural residents and 67% among males. The upward trend and distribution pattern of HIV/AIDS-related deaths depicted in the present study not only provides valuable information for additional understanding of the dynamics of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in China, but also has implications for evidence-based public health intervention strategies and policies as well as for further studies.

AB This work analyzes the impact of firearm mortality between 1980 and 2012 in Argentina. For this purpose a descriptive epidemiological time trend study was carried out including the following variables: sex, age group, intentionality and jurisdiction. Data was obtained from the Office of Health Statistics and Information of the Argentine Ministry of Health. A total of 87,671 deaths due to firearms were discovered, of which 85.7% occurred in men. The highest mortality rate due to firearms corresponded to the year 2002, reaching 21.2 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. The age group concentrating the largest number of deaths due to firearms was that of 20-29 years, accounting for 25.6% of all deaths. The highest adjusted rates corresponded to the years 2000-2002, with values of 10.0 to 11.6 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. This time period coincides with the institutional-economic crisis the country experienced. The province of Buenos Aires was the place of residence of 49.1% of the deceased. In the discussion, political-economic and ideological-cultural dimensions of the relations among firearms, violence, science and society are considered.

AB Loneliness has been recognized as a public health problem that requires the attention of clinicians and researchers both as a condition in itself and in its relation to other conditions. This study sought to examine the relationship between self-reported loneliness, psychological distress, and social support among immigrants. A community survey of 386 recent immigrants to Israel from the former Soviet Union was conducted using the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale (R-UCLA-LS), Talbieh Brief Distress Inventory (TBDI), and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). A cross-sectional design, and correlation and factor analyses were used to study the relationship between the studied variables. The distress-related and distress-free patterns of loneliness were distinguished as independent constructs, each with a specific sphere of influence. Distress-related loneliness accounted for 56.3% and distress-free for 18.2% of the total variance in individual loneliness scores. Distress-related loneliness is a generalized negative experience embedded in an array of distress symptoms, while distress-free loneliness appears to be a normal psychological reaction to dissatisfaction with current friend support. An important implication of this study in mental health practice is the sensitivity to these differences when treating recent immigrants. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB According to recent statistics, depression and suicide are on a rise in the United States and elsewhere. To resolve this is- sue, synonymous to various current approaches, we propose a multi-modal robot interaction framework, which will act as an extension to current Human Robot Interaction systems to further identify studied signs of depression from various data-acoustic features, like images, video, speech, text, and in general, multi-modal data. One of the recent technologies that we plan to introduce in our resolution, is the use of social-humanoid robots (Pepper by SoftBank) to detect early signs of depression via the power of Natural Language and Multi-Modal Interactions. Rather than solely relying on the interaction between professionals and patients/individuals for treatment, the current HRI framework, offers to lower the entry barrier for potential mental health diagnosis and providing medical treatments in convenience of ones reach. To assure the psychological safety of conversation there is also a "psychological safety module" to provide professional assistance/aid for episodic-cognitive behavioral therapy. Our Multi-modal Robot Interaction (MRI) architecture contains of five modules: Multi-modal Data, Social Robot & dialogue system, psycho-linguistic feature extraction, Machine Learning & NLP methods, and Psychological Safety Feedback/Suggestion to end user and experts.

AB Media coverage of the 'War on Terror' has generated different frameworks of understanding that have been shaped by meanings and images that emerged after September 11, 2001. These frameworks of meanings are routinely used to structure and contextualize news stories and events associated with terrorism. This article investigates news frames that four Nigerian newspapers applied to the coverage of an attempted suicide attack on a US-bound aircraft on Christmas Day in 2009. It analyses the newspapers' interpretation of the aborted act of terrorism by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a 23-year-old Nigerian man, which resulted in the United States categorizing Nigeria as a 'country of interest in the context of terrorism'. The article outlines recurrent themes and issues that the newspapers primed for their audiences by interrogating a selection of editorial contents of the publications. It seeks to highlight how discursive fields in the coverage emphasized specific understanding of the event. The article argues that the constructed accounts of the foiled attack were framed and structured to create a distance between Abdulmutallab and his country and that the news frames the newspapers used narrowed public understanding of the significance of Abdulmutallab's radicalization and its possible implications for Nigeria.

AB The present study used data from the Wave 2 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (n = 34,653) to examine lifetime Axis I psychiatric comorbidity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. Lifetime prevalences +/- standard errors of PTSD and partial FTSD were 6.4% +/- 0.18 and 6.6% +/- 0.18, respectively. Rates of PTSD and partial PTSD were higher among women (8.6% +/- 0.26 and 8.6% +/- 0.26) than men (4.1% +/- 0.19 and 4.5% +/- 0.21). Respondents with both PTSD and partial PTSD most commonly reported unexpected death of someone close, serious illness or injury to someone close, and sexual assault as their worst stressful experiences. PTSD and partial PTSD were associated with elevated lifetime rates of mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders, and suicide attempts. Respondents with partial PTSD generally had intermediate odds of comorbid Axis I disorders and psychosocial impairment relative to trauma controls and full PTSD. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We compared depression, social stress and treatment in people of Pakistani origin and white Europeans living in an UK city.
   In a population-based two-phase sample of 1,856 adults we interviewed 651 (77%) of eligible participants, using the schedule for clinical assessment in neuropsychiatry and life events and difficulties schedule. We identified 216 people with depressive and 208 with subthreshold disorder; after 6-months we re-interviewed 398 (94% response).
   Depressive disorder was more common in Pakistani women only (31.1% [24.1-38.0] vs.19.3% [14.1-24.5]) and persisted more often in Pakistanis over 50 years of age (90 vs.66%, P = 0.023). New episodes of depressive disorder occurred in 17% of participants who had subthreshold disorder at baseline in each ethnic group. Persistent depression in the Pakistani group was associated with continuing problems of disabling physical illness and close relationships. Treatment was limited and not associated with persistent depression.
   Persistent depressive disorder in older people of Pakistani origin is associated with potentially remediable factors.

TI Youth risk behavior surveillance - National Alternative High School
   Youth Risk Behavior Survey, United States, 1998
SO JOURNAL OF SCHOOL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID ADOLESCENTS; SYSTEM
AB Alternative high schools serve approximately 280,000 students nationwide who are at high risk for failing or dropping out of regular high school or who have been expelled from regular high school because of illegal activity or behavioral problems. Such settings provide important opportunities for delivering health promotion education and services to these youth and young adults. However; before this survey, the prevalence of health-risk behaviors among students attending alternative high schools nationwide was unknown.
   The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors the following six categories of priority health-risk behaviors among youth and young adults: behaviors that contribute to unintentional and intentional injuries; tobacco use; alcohol and other drug use: sexual behaviors that contribute to unintended pregnancy and sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) (including human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection); unhealthy dietary behaviors; and physical inactivity. The national Alternative High School Youth Risk Behavior, Survey (ALT-YRBS) is one component of the YRBSS; it was conducted in 1998 to measure priority health-risk behaviors among students at alternative high schools. The 1998 ALT-YRBS used a three-stage cluster sample design to produce a nationally representative sample of students in grades 9-12 in the United States who attend alternative high schools. The school response rate Ir as 81.0%, and the student response rate was 81.9%, resulting in an overall response rate of 66.3%. Tills report summarizes results from the 1998 ALT-YRBS. The reporting period is February - May 1998.
   In the United States, 73.6% of all deaths among youth and young adults aged 10-24 years results from only four causes - motor vehicle crashes, other unintentional injuries, homicide, and suicide. Results from the 1998 ALT-YRBS demonstrates that many students at alternative high schools engage in behaviors that increase their likelihood of death from these four causes. During the 30 days preceding the survey 51.9% had ridden with a driver who had been drinking alcohol, 25.1% had driven a vehicle after drinking alcohol. 32.9% had carried a weapon, 64.5% had drunk alcohol, and 53.0% had used marijuana. During the 12 months preceding the survey, 15.7% had attempted suicide, and 29.0% had rarely or never worn a seat belt. Substantial morbidity among school-aged youth and young adults also results from unintended pregnancies and STDs, including HIV infection. ALT-YRBS results indicate that in 1998, a total of 87.8% of students students at alternative high schools had had sexual intercourse, 54.1% of sexually active students had not used a condom at last sexual intercourse, and 5.7% had ever injected an illegal drug. Among adults aged greater than or equal to 25 years, 66.5% of all deaths result from two causes - cardiovascular disease and cancer Most risk behaviors associated with these causes of death are initiated during adolescence. In 1998, a total of 64.1% of students at alternative high schools had smoked cigarettes during the 30 days preceding the survey, 38.3% had smoked a cigar during the 30 days preceding the survey, 71.2% had not eaten greater than or equal to 5 servings of fruits and vegetables during the day preceding the survey, and 81.0% had nor attended physical education (PE) class daily. Comparing ALT-YRBS, results with 1997 national YRBS results demonstrates that the prevalence of most most, risk behaviors is higher among students attending alternative high schools compared with students at regular high schools. Some risk behaviors are more common among certain sex and racial/ethnic subgroups of students.
   ALT-YRBS data can be used nationwide by health and education officials to improve policies and programs designed to reduce risk behaviors associated with the leading causes of,morbidity and mortality among students attending alternative high schools.

ID FEASIBILITY; RESOURCES
AB Background: The ubiquitous presence and functionality of mobile devices offers the potential for mobile health (mHealth) to create equitable health opportunities. While mHealth is used among First Nations populations to respond to health challenges, the characteristics, uptake, and effectiveness of these interventions are unclear.
   Objective: This review aimed to identify the characteristics of mHealth interventions (eg, study locations, health topic, and modality) evaluated with First Nations populations and to summarize the outcomes reported for intervention use, user perspectives including cultural responsiveness, and clinical effectiveness. In addition, the review sought to identify the presence of First Nations expertise in the design and evaluation of mHealth interventions with First Nations populations.
   Methods: The methods of this systematic review were detailed in a registered protocol with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO, CRD42019123276). Systematic searches of peer-reviewed, scientific papers were conducted across 7 databases in October 2018. Eligible studies had a primary focus on mHealth interventions with experimental or quasi-experimental design to respond to a health challenge with First Nations people from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. Two authors independently screened records for eligibility and assessed risk of bias using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklists. Data were synthesized narratively owing to the mix of study designs, interventions, and outcomes. The review was reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement.
   Results: Searches yielded 1053 unique records, after review and screening, 13 studies (5 randomized controlled trials and 8 quasi-experimental designs) were included in the final analysis. Studies were conducted in Australia (n=9), the United States (n=2), and New Zealand (n=2). The most common health challenge addressed was mental health and suicide (n=5). Intervention modalities included text messaging (n=5), apps (n=4), multimedia messaging (n=1), tablet software (n=1), or a combination of short messaging service (SMS) and apps (n=1). Results showed mixed engagement with the intervention (n=3); favorable user perspectives, including acceptability and cultural appropriateness (n=6); and mixed outcomes for clinical effectiveness (n=10). A diverse range of risks of bias were identified, the most common of which included a lack of clarity about allocation and blinding protocols and group treatment for randomized controlled trials and a lack of control group and single outcome measures for quasi-experimental designs. First Nations expertise informed all mHealth studies, through authorship (n=8), affiliation with First Nations bodies (n=3), participatory study design (n=5), First Nations reference groups (n=5), or a combination of these.
   Conclusions: mHealth modalities, including SMS and apps, appear favorable for delivery of health interventions with First Nations populations, particularly in the area of mental health and suicide prevention. Importantly, First Nations expertise was strongly embedded within the studies, augmenting favorable use and user engagement. However, evidence of efficacy is limited.

AB Despite the well-documented association between aggression and NSSI among adolescents, relatively little research has been conducted on the mechanisms underlying this relationship. The purpose of this study was to investigate potential socio-cognitive mechanisms through which aggression and NSSI are related. Participants were 186 adolescents (ages 13-18) recruited from a psychiatric inpatient facility in the northeastern United States. According to teen report, 57.5% of the sample endorsed NSSI in the previous year. Mediation was tested using the modern bootstrapping technique described by Hayes, using 5000 resamples with replacement, including sex and depression diagnosis as covariates. Results demonstrated that greater negative self-talk, a more negative cognitive style, and lower perceived family support were all significant mediators of the relationship between aggression and greater frequency of NSSI, whereas perceived social support from friends was not a significant mediator. Limitations, clinical implications, and future research directions of the current research are discussed. (C) 2014 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

TI Substances Involved in Suicidal Poisonings in the United States
SO SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
ID DRUG-INDUCED SEIZURES; HISTORY; TRENDS
AB ObjectiveThis study investigated specific substances most commonly involved in suicidal poisonings, causing severe clinical effects, and leading to intensive treatments.
   MethodSuicidal poisoning cases for individuals >= 13 years old were obtained from the National Poison Data System for 2011-2015. The most common products involved in single and multiple-product poisonings were identified. Single product cases were used to calculate substances causing the largest numbers of serious clinical effects and leading to intensive treatments.
   ResultsMore than half of reported cases involved only a single product (54.4%), but this frequency was higher at the extremes of age (66.7% in adolescents 13-19 years old and 70.5% in individuals >= 90 years old) and among pregnant women (65.8%). The top three substances involved in single-product poisonings were over-the-counter (OTC) medications, while alcohol and prescription sedatives were most common in multiple-product poisonings. One OTC medication, diphenhydramine, was a frequent cause of several serious clinical effects and intensive treatments.
   ConclusionsSingle product suicidal poisonings were more frequent with extremes of age and in pregnancy. OTC products were more frequently used in single product attempts. Products causing serious clinical effects can be targeted for suicide prevention efforts as well as education of health care providers.

AB Objective: Despite of the importance of psychiatric emergencies (PE) requiring treatment at an emergency room (ER) little is known about their frequency and current trends in terms of quantity and quality.
   Methods: A retrospective analysis of all PE treated at the ER of the University Hospital Ulm (Germany) in 2000 and 2010.
   Results: 6% (2000) or 5% (2010) of the ER cases were PE. Despite an increase from 369 to 430 cases (+ 16,5 %) their share decreased because of an even stronger increase of other emergencies (+ 33%). The most frequent PE in 2000 was alcohol intoxication (37,7 %), while it was intoxication with prescribed and/or illicit drugs in 2010 (47,9 %). Patients with alcohol intoxications were significantly younger in 2010 as compared with 2000. Suicide attempts were seen in every fourth PE. They were significantly more frequent in 2010. PEs were generally more frequent in the evening and over the night.
   Conclusion: This study provides first insight into current trends in PE treated at the ER in Germany. Our data provide an empirical starting point for optimizing clinical care, although the study is limited by its retrospective and mono-centric design.

TI Hypothermia and Protection from Acetaminophen-Induced Liver Injury
SO THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA AND TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA; MODERATE HYPOTHERMIA; FAILURE
AB Acetaminophen-induced liver failure is the most common cause of acute liver failure in the United States. The exact mechanism of acute liver failure secondary to acetaminophen toxicity is unknown, although a presumed mechanism of hepatocellular necrosis involving the accumulation of a toxic metabolite (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine) has been postulated. A 62-year-old woman with a history of a suicide attempt was brought to the emergency department at similar to 12 hours post acetaminophen overdose. The patient presented with an acetaminophen level of 284 mcg/mL and with profound hypothermia (31 degrees C). Liver function tests and coagulation studies were normal. Within 24 hours of presentation, the patient was normothermic, had received seven oral doses of N-acetylcysteine, and had an acetaminophen level of N-acetylcysteine was required. Despite a toxic acetaminophen level, this patient did not suffer any hepatic injury. Hypothermia may have attenuated the production of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine by depressing the cytochrome P450 system, allowing accumulation of the parent drug rather than toxic metabolites. This case report suggests that hypothermia may have protected the liver of a patient presenting with acetaminophen toxicity and supports further investigation into the potential therapeutic role of induced hypothermia during acetaminophen toxicity.

TI Terrorism and asylum seekers: Why the Real ID Act is a false promise
SO HARVARD JOURNAL ON LEGISLATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The Real ID Act, passed on May 11, 2005, is the first post-September 11 antiterrorism legislation specifically to target a group of vulnerable individuals to whom the United States has historically granted protection: asylum seekers. The passage of the Real ID Act led asylum advocates to wring their hands in despair and immigration restrictionists to clap their hands in glee. This Article argues that both sides of the debate may have been justified in their reactions, but not because of the immediate chilling impact on asylum that they seem to expect. With regard to requirements for establishing asylum eligibility, the Real ID Act, rather than imposing new, onerous restrictions on asylum, codifies case law upon which adjudicators, advocates, and government attorneys have been relying for decades. However, several areas of poor drafting, combined with legislative history mischaracterizing the asylum system as a haven for terrorists and suicide bombers, may result in the denial of bona fide asylum applications. This Article provides concrete guidance for adjudicators, advocates, and government attorneys applying the Real ID Act to asylum cases. It examines the case law upon which some of the provisions are based and offers interpretations for unclear provisions. Overall, this Article emphasizes that it is the duo, of adjudicators, advocates, and government attorneys to protect victims of persecution.

AB The objective Of this Study was to describe empirical and natural lifetime patterns of depressive and anxiety symptoms reported by community respondents and primary care attenders. The Grade of Membership model was used to analyze data collected from 716 subjects between 18 and 64 years of age with a lifetime diagnosis of DIS/DSM-III-R Major Depressive Episode. Symptoms of depression, mania, and anxiety (GAD, panic attack, and phobias) were processed. Six prototype categories (pure types) provided the best description of the structure of symptoms included in the analysis. Type 1: bipolar depression with marked suicidal behaviour, comorbidity and early onset. Type II: non-melancholic-somatisation depression with late onset. Type III: non-melancholic, non-severe bipolar depression with male preponderance. Type IV: depression secondary to anxiety with marked female preponderance. Type V: melancholic depression With suicide ideation. Type VI: melancholic depression with panic attacks and female preponderance. The results support the heterogeneity of the longitudinal symptom pattern of depression and the existence of two time-trend types of comorbid anxiety disorders. (C) 2002 Elsevier B.V.

AB The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), a widely used and comprehensive assessment of mindfulness, has demonstrated promising psychometric properties among non-clinical and clinical samples and among diverse international samples. Yet, to date, no studies have examined its factor structure, reliability, and validity in a clinical sample of United States (USA) underrepresented minorities. The current study addressed this by investigating the factor structure, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and construct validity of the FFMQ among 283 low-income African American adults with a recent suicide attempt. Exploratory factor analysis revealed a 20-item, five-factor measure: acting with awareness, describing, non-judging, observing, and non-reacting. Confirmatory factor analysis supported this reduced item five-factor structure. Internal consistency coefficients ranged from 60-86, but test-retest reliability coefficients did not support the temporal stability. Construct validity was supported; FFMQ facets were correlated with theoretically related constructs, such as self-compassion and self-criticism. Several facets were negatively associated with depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation, and the describing facet demonstrated unique predictive validity for depressive symptoms. These findings support the cultural relevance and utility of the FFMQ with African Americans with significant psychological distress.

AB Purpose of review
   Quality of life (QOL) has become a standard outcome measure in psychiatry. The QOL concept is culture-dependent, which means that the results of Western studies may not be applicable to Chinese patients. The aim of this study is to summarize the recent literature on QOL and mental health in Chinese culture.
   Recent findings
   QOL has increasingly been used as an outcome measure of pharmacotherapeutic or psychosocial interventions in Chinese societies. Recent studies have suggested that socio-cultural factors exert an influence on the QOL of Chinese psychiatric patients. Patients with major psychiatric disorders have a poorer QOL than the general population. Socio-demographic characteristics have no, or only weak, associations with QOL in schizophrenia, whereas novel antipsychotics and antidepressants improve QOL relative to traditional psychotropic medications in the short term.
   Summary
   The inclusion of QOL measures in routine clinical practice and research in Chinese societies should be encouraged, and culture-sensitive QOL measures should be developed. Chinese psychiatry should also implement appropriate strategies and effective measures in line with the findings on the relationship between QOL and socio-demographic and clinical factors.

AB Despite advances in the care of infants, there remain many newborns whose medical conditions are incompatible with sustained life. At times, healthcare providers and parents may agree that prolonging life is not an appropriate goal of care, and they may redirect treatment to alleviate suffering. While pediatric palliative treatment protocols are gaining greater acceptance, there remain some children whose suffering is unrelenting despite maximal efforts. Due to the realization that some infants suffer unbearably (ie, the burdens of suffering outweigh the benefits of life), the Dutch have developed a protocol for euthanizing these newborns. In this review, I examine the ethical aspects of 6 forms of end of life care, explain the ethical arguments in support of euthanasia, review the history and verbiage of the United States regulations governing limiting and withdrawing life-prolonging interventions in infants, describe the 3 categories of neonates for whom the Dutch provide euthanasia, review the published analyses of the Dutch protocol, and finally present some practical considerations should some form of euthanasia ever be deemed appropriate.

   Methods. Using bivariate and multivariable statistics, we analyzed a population-weighted sample of 8315 veterans from the 2010 National Survey of Veterans and a random sample of 567 recent veterans from Hawaii.
   Results. A total of 1.5% of veterans were AA/PI compared with 0.4% a decade ago. Compared with other veterans, AA/PI veterans reported higher socioeconomic status and better mental health, although these findings may be specific to AA veterans. Adjusting for sociodemographic and health differences, we found no differences in health service use or perceived barriers or stigma related to mental health services.
   Conclusions. AA/PIs are a small but fast-growing racial/ethnic group within the veteran population that deserves attention. Although veteran status may be protective against some barriers to mental health care found in the general AA/PI population, efforts to reduce barriers to health care among veterans should be continued.

AB Exposure to strong acids such as sulfuric acid to either the skin or the gastrointestinal or respiratory mucosa will result respectively in significant-occasionally fatal-cutaneous chemical burns as well as devastating corrosive damage to the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Most injuries are accidental, but there are reports of using acids as weapons or as a means of suicide. The primary mechanism of acid injury is coagulative necrosis of the tissues. Sulfuric acid is a chemical often used in industrial and chemical laboratories, and it is an ingredient in household products like drain cleaner. Easily accessible, over-the-counter, household drain cleaner is one of several common materials used to manufacture methamphetamine. With increasing clandestine methamphetamine laboratories in the United States, exposure to methamphetamine and the toxic chemicals used for its production is a growing problem. In many instances, children living in these laboratories qua homes are at risk for injury and death. We report the death of an unattended toddler, who ingested sulfuric acid drain cleaner in his home. The gross and histopathological autopsy findings in this case are similar to those of previously described cases of sulfuric acid injury.

AB Objectives. We compared protective factors among bisexual adolescents with those of heterosexual, mostly heterosexual, and gay or lesbian adolescents.
   Methods. We analyzed 6 school-based surveys in Minnesota and British Columbia. Sexual orientation was measured by gender of sexual partners, attraction, or self-labeling. Protective factors included family connectedness, school connectedness, and religious involvement. General linear models, conducted separately by gender and adjusted for age, tested differences between orientation groups.
   Results. Bisexual adolescents reported significantly less family and school connectedness than did heterosexual and mostly heterosexual adolescents and higher or similar levels of religious involvement. In surveys that measured orientation by self-labeling or attraction, levels of protective factors were generally higher among bisexual than among gay and lesbian respondents. Adolescents with sexual partners of both genders reported levels of protective factors lower than or similar to those of adolescents with same-gender partners.
   Conclusions. Bisexual adolescents had lower levels of most protective factors than did heterosexual adolescents, which may help explain their higher prevalence of risky behavior. Social connectedness should be monitored by including questions about protective factors in youth health surveys. (Am J Public Health. 2009;99:110-117. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2007.123109)

AB Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating terminal neurodegenerative disease with a highly predictable clinical course such that palliative care should begin at or soon after diagnosis. The outcome is certain in most cases. The only medication approved for treatment in the United States, riluzole, extends life by about 2 months. Virtually all skeletal muscles eventually are affected. Multiple problems require a multidisciplinary approach including aggressive symptomatic management, rehabilitation to maintain motor function, nutritional and respiratory support, augmentative communication devices, and psychological support for both patients and families because family members so often play a central role in management and care. Social, bioethical, and financial issues as well as advance directives should be addressed long before enteral feeding or assistive ventilatory support might be considered. Goals of care should be assessed on an ongoing basis. Presenting the unusual case of a patient with ALS who is also a prominent neurologist specializing in ALS, we enumerate issues in management and palliative care applicable to ALS but also to other fatal, progressive neurologic diseases such as Huntington's chorea and late-stage Parkinson disease.

ID THERAPY; VNS
AB Depressive disorders are the fourth most common disease causing the patients' disability worldwide. They are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, not only because of the increased risk of suicide but also because of cardiac complications and stroke. Depression also results in negative economic impacts due to exclusion of treated patients from their daily activities. There is an increased frequency of consultations and hospitalizations in patients with depression. On average, over one third of patients do not respond or poorly respond to conservative treatment. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) may be effective in these patients. In March 2001, VNS was recognized in Europe as a treatment for depression in patients who are refractory or intolerant to conservative treatment, both in cases of major depressive episodes and in bipolar disease. In the United States, the method was recognized by the FDA in July 2005 as an adjunct treatment for long-term chronic refractory depression or for recurrent major depressive episodes refractory to conservative treatment in patients over 18 years of age who did not improve after four or more schemes of antidepressant therapy. The following is a report of two cases of patients with depression treated by left VNS.

AB Objectives: To examine age- and cause-specific injury mortality differentiats between low-income (LICs), middle-income (MICs) and high-income countries (HICs), and to discuss their implications in explaining changing injury mortality patterns with economic development against the background of general health transition theory.
   Study design: Cross-sectional study.
   Methods: The World Health Organization's mortality database was used as the source of injury mortality data. The grouping into LICs, MICs and HICs was based on data from World Development Indicator.
   Results: Unintentional injury mortality (UIM) rates in children and adults are highest in LICs and MICs, respectively. UIM rates in the elderly population, however, increase with higher economic conditions and are highest in HICs.
   Conclusion: Based on these findings, it is hypothesized that ageing and injury interplay mutually with regard to health transition; declining rates in child UIM with economic development contributes to the ageing process, white increasing UIM among the elderly, in combination with ageing populations, boosts the absolute number of injury deaths in this segment.

AB Objective: The US Burden of Disease Collaborators reported that between 1990 and 2016, the top 10 states with increasing probability of death between the ages of 20 and 55 years were all in the South. A recent study of annual surveillance data found that increasing all-cause mortality rates were occurring in middle-age non-Hispanic whites. The vast proportion of all-cause mortality consists of medical causes, not external causes (i.e., overdose, mental illness, suicide, homicide, or motor vehicle crashes). It has been hypothesized by researchers that the ongoing opioid epidemic has an etiologic role in the trend of increasing medical death, but ecological studies looking for an association have not been published. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that hydrocodone and oxycodone sales are temporally associated and correlated with annual NHW45-54 medical-cause mortality rates in the Deep South region comprised of Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and South Carolina.
   Methods: Mortality and opioid sales data were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wonder Detailed Mortality and University of Wisconsin State Health Access Data Assistance Center databases, respectively. Annual, state and regional NHW45-54 medical-cause mortality and opioid sales data were analyzed using Spearman rank correlation (rs) testing, after first and second differencing, in order to achieve stationarity and control for trend similarities.
   Results: Sales of prescription opioids follow very similar temporal patterns across these six states, with simultaneous increases in 2007 and 2013. With few exceptions, annual opioids sales trends were correlated state-to-state. Two prominent spikes are evident in the aggregated opioid sales trends of the six states, with both sales spikes preceding same-directional fluctuations in medical-cause mortality by similar to 1 year. After a 1 year adjustment of second-differenced data, population hydrocodone exposure was correlated with female NHW45-54 population medical-cause mortality [rs((13)) = 0.540; P = 0.038]; and oxycodone exposure correlated with male NHW45-54 population medical-cause mortality [rs((13)) = 0.607; P = 0.016].
   Conclusions: State sales of prescription hydrocodone and oxycodone in the six states studied follow non-random, systematic trajectories. A strong correlation and temporal association exists between prescription opioid sales and medical-cause mortality in this Deep South NHW45-54 population.

   RISK-FACTORS; TOBACCO USE; SMOKING; BEHAVIORS; ADHERENCE; STRESS
AB Background: Depression and risk behaviors occur often in adolescents in the United States, but their frequency in youth with asthma is not well documented.
   Objective: To establish rates of and associations between depression and substance use in youth with asthma.
   Methods: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducted the 2005 Youth Risk Behavior Survey with 13,917 students in grades 9 to 12 from 159 high schools in 40 states, producing a nationally representative distribution of students by grade, sex, and race/ethnicity. The Youth Risk Behavior Survey documents self-reported suicide intent and health risk behaviors, including use of tobacco, marijuana, alcohol, and cocaine.
   Results: In 720 adolescents reporting current asthma (5.2% of the total sample), depression symptoms, cigarette smoking, and cocaine use occurred more frequently than in youth without asthma. Substance use increased with depression; of youth with asthma reporting suicidal ideation, 40% had smoked cigarettes, 67% had smoked marijuana, 37% had engaged in binge drinking, and 12% had used cocaine in the past 30 days. Overall odds ratios for substance abuse in the group with asthma were not altered when controlling for age, sex, and race, although odds ratios for specific risk behaviors in those with asthma varied slightly within age, sex, and race groups.
   Conclusions: National rates of depression and associated risk behaviors in youth with asthma have not been previously reported, indicate a need to screen adolescents with asthma for depression, and suggest that risk behaviors in this population may signal heightened need for intervention.

AB A major public health problem facing American colleges is binge drinking by students with adverse effects on academic achievement and self-fulfillment. The short-term negative consequences of binge drinking include memory loss, hangovers, and blackouts. Binge drinking has been related to campus problems, suicides, violence, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), heightened aggression, automobile accidents, property damage, and academic failure. This study investigated the relationship of impulsivity to readiness to change binge drinking behavior among college students attending a 4-year university. The theoretical formulation for the study was based on Prochaska and DiClemente's transtheoretical model. Participants were volunteer undergraduate college students from a state-supported Southeastern University. The students were recruited from undergraduate classrooms, fraternities, and sororities. The volunteer participants were 248 undergraduate college students enrolled in a 4-year university in the southeastern United States. This study consists of a subgroup, 131 of the 248 participants which were 93 binge drinkers and 38 nondrinkers. Three surveys were administered: the Student Alcohol Questionnaire (SAQ), Barratt's Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11), and the Brief Readiness to Change Questionnaire (BRCQ). Impulsivity was significantly correlated with binge drinking and the transtheoretical stages of change. Impulsivity can result in a lack of inhibitory control, which is a risk factor for binge drinking. The results of this study suggest that impulsivity may interfere with intentional behavioral change. This study may have valuable implications for the current and future design of alcohol prevention programs at institutions of higher education.

AB More than 20 years ago, even before voters in Oregon had enacted the first aid in dying (AID) statute in the United States, Timothy Quill and colleagues proposed clinical criteria AID. Their proposal was carefully considered and temperate, but there were little data on the practice of AID at the time. (With AID, a physician writes a prescription for life-ending medication for a terminally ill, mentally capacitated adult.) With the passage of time, a substantial body of data on AID has developed from the states of Oregon and Washington. For more than 17 years, physicians in Oregon have been authorized to provide a prescription for AID. Accordingly, we have updated the clinical criteria of Quill, et al., based on the many years of experience with AID. With more jurisdictions authorizing AID, it is critical that physicians can turn to reliable clinical criteria. As with any medical practice, AID must be provided in a safe and effective manner. Physicians need to know (1) how to respond to a patient's inquiry about AID, (2) how to assess patient decision making capacity, and (3) how to address a range of other issues that may arise. To ensure that physicians have the guidance they need, Compassion & Choices convened the Physician Aid-in-Dying Clinical Criteria Committee, in July 2012, to create clinical criteria for physicians who are willing to provide AID to patients who request it. The committee includes experts in medicine, law, bioethics, hospice, nursing, social work, and pharmacy. Using an iterative consensus process, the Committee drafted the criteria over a one-year period.

AB Background:Historically, mental health clinicians at Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs) have not had the same access to continuing education (CE) as providers at VA medical centers. Mental health clinicians at CBOCs desire an opportunity for VA-sponsored CE, especially on topics and issues pertinent to rural mental healthcare.Materials and Methods:Since November 2011, VA CBOC mental health providers in 11 states have been offered a monthly live Web conferencing CE program. This article describes the program's development, implementation, and evaluation.Results:Eleven CE programs have been offered to 397 unique participants. Participants have provided positive feedback about the topics and their impact on job performance. Most negative feedback has been related to technical and logistical problems with the Web conferencing platform. Although providers asked for reportable CE units for licensure, many did not complete the post-test, which is required to receive credit for completing the course.Conclusions:The Web conferencing format has been well received by participants. Despite technical issues, results show that the participants were satisfied with the content of the trainings and could apply the materials to their job. Although CE units were available, not all participants applied for credit. Efforts to improve technical support and the rate of post-test completion are discussed. Rural mental health providers often have limited access to training opportunities. The VA CBOC Mental Health Rounds, using an interactive Web conferencing platform, has been a successful modality for delivering CE to rural clinicians in the United States.

AB OBJECTIVE
   To develop a comprehensive taxonomy of practice-related stressors experienced by US veterinarians.
   DESIGN
   Cross-sectional survey.
   SAMPLE
   A subset of 1,422 US veterinarians who provided written (vs selected) responses to a question in a previous survey regarding practice-related stressors.
   PROCEDURES
   Using grounded theory analysis, 3 researchers inductively analyzed written survey responses concerning respondents' main practice-related stressors. In 5 iterations, responses were individually coded and categorized, and a final list of practice-related stressor categories and subcategories was iteratively and collaboratively developed until theoretical and analytic saturation of the data was achieved.
   RESULTS
   A taxonomy of 15 categories of broad practice-related stressors and 40 subcategories of more specific practice-related stressors was developed. The most common practice-related stressor categories included financial insecurity (n = 289 [20.3%]), client issues (254 [17.9%]), coworker or interpersonal issues (181 [12.7%]), and work-life balance (166 [11.7%]). The most common subcategories were clients unwilling to pay (118 [8.3%]), low income (98 [6.9%]), cost of maintaining practice (56 [3.9%]), and government or state board policies (48 [3.4%]).
   CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE
   This study provided a comprehensive list of the types of practice-related stressors experienced by US veterinarians, building a foundation for future research into relationships between job stress and mental health in this population. Frequency data on the various stressors provided an initial understanding of factors that might be contributing to high stress rates among US veterinarians.

ID MATERNAL MORTALITY; FINLAND
AB Objective: We compared official maternal mortality statistics with those from a special study covering all pregnancy-associated deaths in two European countries (Finland and France) and in two US states (Massachusetts and North Carolina) in 1999-2000 to characterize pregnancy-related deaths that are not included in official statistics.
   Study design: We linked the official ICD-10-based maternal mortality data for 84 deaths with study data on 404 pregnancy-associated deaths. Results: Of the pregnancy-associated deaths, 151 were pregnancy-related. We found 69 pregnancy-related deaths that had not been included as maternal deaths. and two deaths coded as maternal deaths that did not meet our definition for a pregnancy-related death. In total, 58 of these 69 deaths were from medical causes and I I were from external causes or injuries (10 postpartum depression-related suicides and one accidental drug poisoning). The unreported deaths due to medical causes included 27 direct, 15 indirect, and two direct/indirect pregnancy-related deaths and 14 possibly pregnancy-related deaths. The most common causes of the unreported deaths due to medical causes were intracerebral hemorrhage (7 deaths), peripartum cardiomyopathy (4), pulmonary embolism (4) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (4). Conclusions: The collection of data on pregnancy-related and pregnancy-associated deaths is useful for countries with low maternal mortality figures. The use of various data-collection methods may substantially increase the quality of maternal mortality statistics. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives. To examine the prevalence of household firearms and firearm- storage practices in the 50 states and the District of Columbia and estimate the number of children exposed to unsafe storage practices.
   Methods. We analyzed data from the 2002 cross- sectional Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey of 240 735 adults from randomly selected households with telephones in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.
   Results. Nationally, 32.6% of adults reported that firearms were kept in or around their home. The prevalence of adults with household firearms ranged from 5.2% in the District of Columbia to 62.8% in Wyoming ( median: 40.8%). The prevalence of adults with loaded household firearms ranged from 1.6% in Hawaii, Massachusetts, and New Jersey to 19.2% in Alabama ( median: 7.0%), and the prevalence of adults with loaded and unlocked household firearms ranged from 0.4% in Massachusetts to 12.7% in Alabama ( median: 4.2%). Among adults with children and youth < 18 years old, the prevalence of loaded household firearms ranged from 1.0% to 13.4% ( median: 5.3%), and the prevalence of loaded and unlocked household firearms ranged from 0.3% to 7.3% ( median: 2.3%); in each instance, Massachusetts had the lowest prevalence and Alabama had the highest. Findings indicate that similar to 1.69 million ( 95% confidence interval: 1.57 - 1.82 million) children and youth in the United States < 18 years old are living with loaded and unlocked household firearms.
   Conclusions. Substantial state variations exist in the prevalence of household firearms and firearm- storage practices. It is vital that surveillance systems such as the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System continue to monitor the prevalence of household firearms and firearm- storage practices so that future interventions to promote safe storage of firearms can be evaluated and more widely implemented based on their efficacy.

AB BACKGROUND Epidemiologic trends in trauma-related mortality in the United States require updating and characterization. We hypothesized that during the past decade, there have been changing trends in mortality that are associated with multiple public health and health care-related factors.
   METHODS Multiple sources were queried for the period of 2002 to 2010: the National Trauma Data Bank, the National Centers for Disease Control, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample, and the US Census Bureau. The incidence of injury and mortality for motor vehicle traffic (MVT) collisions, firearms, and falls were determined using National Centers for Disease Control data. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data were used to determine motor vehicle collision information. Injury severity data were derived from the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample and National Trauma Data Bank. Analysis of mortality trends by year was performed using the Cochran-Armitage test for trend. Time-trend multivariable Poisson regression was used to determine risk-adjusted mortality over time.
   RESULTS From 2002 to 2010, the total trauma-related mortality decreased by 6% (p < 0.01). However, mortality trends differed by mechanism. There was a 27% decrease in the MVT death rate associated with a 20% decrease in motor vehicle collisions, 19% decrease in the number of occupant injuries per collision, lower injury severity, and improved outcomes at trauma centers. While firearm-related mortality remained relatively unchanged, mortality caused by firearm suicides increased, whereas homicide-associated mortality decreased (p < 0.001 for both). In contrast, fall-related mortality increased by 46% (5.95-8.70, p < 0.01).
   CONCLUSION MVT mortality rates have decreased during the last decade, owing in part to decreases in the number and severity of injuries. Conversely, fall-related mortality is increasing and is projected to exceed both MVT and firearm mortality rates should current trends continue. Trauma systems and injury prevention programs will need to take into account these changing trends to best accommodate the needs of the injured population.

AB Building on our earlier research (Case and Deaton 2015), we find that mortality and morbidity among white non-Hispanic Americans in midlife since the turn of the century continued to climb through 2015. Additional increases in drug overdoses, suicides, and alcohol-related liver mortality particularly among those with a high school degree or less are responsible for an overall increase in all-cause mortality among whites. We find marked differences in mortality by race and education, with mortality among white non Hispanics (males and females) rising for those without a college degree, and falling for those with a college degree. In contrast, mortality rates among blacks and Hispanics have continued to fall, irrespective of educational attainment. Mortality rates in comparably rich countries have continued their premillennial fall at the rates that used to characterize the United States. Contemporaneous levels of resources particularly slowly growing, stagnant, and even declining incomes cannot provide a comprehensive explanation for poor mortality outcomes. We propose a preliminary but plausible story in which cumulative disadvantage from one birth cohort to the next-in the labor market, in marriage and child outcomes, and in health is triggered by progressively worsening labor market opportunities at the time of entry for whites with low levels of education. This account, which fits much of the data, has the profoundly negative implication that policies even ones that successfully improve earnings and jobs, or redistribute income-will take many years to reverse the increase in mortality and morbidity, and that those in midlife now are likely to do worse in old age than the current elderly. This is in contrast to accounts in which resources affect health contemporaneously, so that those in midlife now can expect to do better in old age as they receive Social Security and Medicare. None of this, however, implies that there are no policy levers to be pulled. For instance, reducing the overprescription of opioids should be an obvious target for policymakers.

AB Background: The contents of traditional communication media and new internet social media reflect the interests of society. However, certain barriers and a lack of attention towards mental disorders have been previously observed.
   Objective: The objective of this study is to measure the relevance of influential American mainstream media outlets for the distribution of psychiatric information and the interest generated in these topics among their Twitter followers.
   Methods: We investigated tweets generated about mental health conditions and diseases among 15 mainstream general communication media outlets in the United States of America between January 2007 and December 2016. Our study strategy focused on identifying several psychiatric terms of primary interest. The number of retweets generated from the selected tweets was also investigated. As a control, we examined tweets generated about the main causes of death in the United States of America, the main chronic neurological degenerative diseases, and HIV.
   Results: In total, 13,119 tweets about mental health disorders sent by the American mainstream media outlets were analyzed. The results showed a heterogeneous distribution but preferential accumulation for a select number of conditions. Suicide and gender dysphoria accounted for half of the number of tweets sent. Variability in the number of tweets related to each control disease was also found (5998). The number of tweets sent regarding each different psychiatric or organic disease analyzed was significantly correlated with the number of retweets generated by followers (1,030,974 and 424,813 responses to mental health disorders and organic diseases, respectively). However, the probability of a tweet being retweeted differed significantly among the conditions and diseases analyzed. Furthermore, the retweeted to tweet ratio was significantly higher for psychiatric diseases than for the control diseases (odds ratio 1.11, CI 1.07-1.14; P < .001).
   Conclusions: American mainstream media outlets and the general public demonstrate a preferential interest for psychiatric diseases on Twitter. The heterogeneous weights given by the media outlets analyzed to the different mental health disorders and conditions are reflected in the responses of Twitter followers.

AB Background and aimsPrescription opioid overdose is a leading cause of injury-related morbidity and mortality in the United States. We aimed to identify characteristics associated with clinical severity in emergency department patients with prescription opioid overdose.
   DesignThis was a secondary data analysis of adult prescription opioid overdoses from a large prospective cohort of acute overdoses. We examined elements of a typical emergency department evaluation using a multivariable model to determine which characteristics were associated with clinical severity, specifically severe respiratory depression (SRD).
   SettingThis study was conducted at two urban academic emergency departments in New York City, USA.
   ParticipantsAdult patients who presented with acute prescription opioid overdose between 2009 and 2013 were included in the current study. We analyzed 307 patients (mean age=44.7, 42% female, 2.0% mortality).
   MeasurementsPatient demographics, reported substances ingested, suspected intent for ingesting the substance, vital signs, laboratory data, treatments including antidotes and intubation and outcome of death were recorded by trained research assistants. Intent was categorized into four mutually exclusive categories: suicide, misuse, therapeutic error and undetermined. The primary outcome was SRD, defined as administration of either (a) naloxone or (b) endotracheal intubation (ETI).
   FindingsA total of 109 patients suffered SRD with 90 patients receiving naloxone alone, nine ETI alone and 10 both naloxone and ETI. The most common opioids were oxycodone (n=124) and methadone (n=116). Mean age was higher in patients with SRD (51.1 versus 41.1, P<0.001). Opioid misuse was associated with SRD in the multivariable analysis [odds ratio (OR)=2.07, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.21-3.55]. The unadjusted relative risk of SRD was high for fentanyl (83.3% SRD) and lowest for codeine (3.6% SRD).
   ConclusionIn emergency department patients in the United States with prescription opioid overdose, worse clinical severity was associated with opioid misuse, increased with age and was widely variable, depending on the specific opioid medication involved.

AB BACKGROUND: Gun injury is a leading cause of death among US children and adolescents. Unintentional firearm death disproportionately affects youth. Reports have shown that at least a third of US homes with children have firearms. When children are fatally injured by guns, the location is most often a home, the shooter is family, the gun owner is a relative, and the gun most often originates from the home, where it was left unlocked.
   METHODS: We conducted an Internet search of pediatric(0-18 years old) fatal and nonfatal firearm injuries from January 1 toAugust 31, 2014, in the United States, querying the terms shot, gun, accident, and year-old for media reports. Cases were screened for intent and coded for demographics, location, gun specifics, circumstances, relationship between the victim, shooter, gun owner, and any resultant charges.
   RESULTS: A total of 277 unintentional pediatric gun injury events were reviewed, two-thirds were nonfatal. Half of the victims were younger than 13 years; 25.3% were younger than 7 years, 80% of the victims and 85.6% of the shooters were male. Of shooters, 84.3% were the child victim themselves, a family member, or a friend/acquaintance. Seventy-seven percent of the events took place in a residence. When gun ownershipwas reported, 68% were owned by a family member. When charges were reported, a third were against minors.
   CONCLUSION: This study reinforced previous studies that unintentional child firearm injuries predominantly involve the home, family guns, young children, and males, and most could be prevented through adult responsibility for minimizing child access and securing storage of firearms. We further learned that media accounts frequently did not report on gun ownership or charges, details which might increase community awareness or inform policies useful to prevention. Shooters, not owners, were more often charged in unintentional child injuries, and minors were charged even when Child Access Prevention laws could be applied.

ID THIOSULFATE
AB Sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate are common cyanide antidotes. Hydroxocobalamin was approved for use in the United States in 2006. Our objective was to determine the frequency of antidote use as reported to the US poison centers from 2005 to 2009 and describe which antidotes were used in critically ill cyanide toxic patients. We performed a retrospective review over 5 years (2005-2009) from 61 US poison centers. We identified all cyanide-exposed cases that received a cyanide antidote. Variables collected included demographics, gastric decontamination, antidote used, predefined serious clinical effects (hypotension, cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, and coma), and predefined serious therapies (cardiopulmonary resuscitation, vasopressors, atropine, anticonvulsant, antidysrhythmic, and intubation/ventilation). One trained abstractor abstracted each chart to a standardized electronic form. Another investigator audited 20% of the charts. Kappa values were calculated. One hundred sixty-five exposures were identified. Mean age was 42 years (range, 3-93 years). Seventy-one percent were male. Exposures were 27% ingestion and 53% inhalation. Thirty-two percent of the ingestions were suicide attempts. Twenty percent (32 of 157) of all cases died. Over all years reported, hydroxocobalamin was administered to 29% (45 of 157) of patients, sodium nitrite to 25%, and sodium thiosulfate to 46%. Hydroxocobalamin use increased from 24% to 54% from 2007 to 2009, respectively (P = 0.024). Sodium thiosulfate use decreased from 73% to 31% (P = 0.002) and sodium nitrite use decreased from 26% to 14% (P = 0.39). The proportion of cases with serious clinical effects that received hydroxocobalamin increased each year, and the proportion that received other antidotes decreased. Hydroxocobalamin was also administered more often in cases that required serious therapies and increased each year. Hydroxocobalamin use for cyanide toxicity increased each year as reported to the US poison centers. Reported use of sodium thiosulfate and sodium nitrite decreased over the same years. In addition, hydroxocobalamin was used more often each year in critically ill cyanide toxic patients than were sodium nitrite or sodium thiosulfate.

AB Background: Research on the generalizability of clinical trial results for bipolar disorder is limited. The present post hoc study sought to quantify the generalizability of clinical trial results in individuals with DSM-IV bipolar disorder to a large representative community sample.
   Method: Data were derived from the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), a large, nationally representative sample of 43,093 adults from the United States population. We applied a standard set of eligibility criteria representative of clinical trials to all adults with DSM-IV bipolar depression (n=785) or mania (n=724) in the past 12 months and then to a subsample of participants seeking treatment for bipolar depression (n=276). Our aim was to determine the proportion of participants with bipolar depression or acute mania who would have been excluded from a clinical trial by typical eligibility criteria.
   Results: We found that more than 5 of 10 participants with bipolar depression (58.17%) or mania (55.75%) would have been excluded by at least 1 eligibility criterion. In the subgroup of participants with bipolar depression who sought treatment, the exclusion rate by at least 1 criterion was higher (63.87%). Having a significant risk of suicide was the criterion excluding the highest percentage of participants in the bipolar depression samples, while having a current DSM-IV diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence was the one leading to the greatest exclusion rate in clinical trials for participants with acute mania. Exclusion rates were higher for participants with bipolar I depression compared with those with bipolar II depression.
   Conclusions:Traditional clinical trials tend to exclude a majority of individuals with bipolar disorder. Clinical trials should carefully consider the impact of eligibility criteria on the generalizability of their results and explain the rationale for their use. Future trials should weigh the trade-offs between internal validity and the representativeness of the study.

AB Objectives: To present findings on the prevalence, correlates, and psychiatric comorbidity of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and partial PTSD in a nationally representative sample of US. older adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: Face-to-face interviews with 9,463 adults age 60 years and older in the Wave 2 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. Measurements: Sociodemographic correlates; worst stressful experiences; comorbid lifetime mood, anxiety, substance use, and personality disorders; psychosocial functioning; and suicide attempts. Results: Lifetime prevalences +/- standard errors of PTSD and partial PTSD were 4.5% +/- 0.25 and 5.5% +/- 0.27, respectively. Rates were higher in women (5.7% +/- 0.37 and 6.5% +/- 0.39) than in men (3.1% +/- 0.31 and 4.3% +/- 0.37). Older adults with PTSD most frequently identified unexpected death of someone close, serious illness or injury to someone close, and their own serious or life-threatening illness as their worst stressful events. Older adults exposed to trauma but without full or partial PTSD and respondents with partial PTSD most often identified unexpected death of someone close, serious illness or injury to someone close, and indirect experience of 9/11 as their worst events. PTSD was associated with elevated odds of lifetime mood, anxiety, drug use, and borderline and narcissistic personality disorders and decreased psychosocial functioning. Partial PTSD was associated with elevated odds of mood, anxiety, and narcissistic and schizotypal personality disorders and poorer psychosocial functioning relative to older adults exposed to trauma but without full or partial PTSD. Conclusions: PTSD among older adults in the United States is slightly more prevalent than previously reported and is associated with considerable psychiatric comorbidity and psychosocial dysfunction. Partial PTSD is associated with significant psychiatric comorbidity, particularly with mood and other anxiety disorders. (Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 2012; 20:380-390)

   CLINICAL PRESENTATION
AB Studies concerning the treatment of substance-abusing suicidal patients are scarce despite the frequent presence of suicidal behavior among this population. Indeed, suicidality (ideation or behavior) is generally an exclusion criterion for participation in treatment studies of subjects with alcohol or drug abuse. Consequently, to date, little is known about the optimal treatment of this population. The first study involving substance-abusing suicidal patients was an open-label trial conducted in the early 1990s. This study involved 12 patients, all of whom demonstrated recent suicidal ideations and had made a lifetime suicide attempt. The results of that open-label study demonstrated significant within-group improvement in both depressive symptoms (including suicidal ideations) and level of drinking. However, substantial residual depressive symptoms and drinking persisted at the end of the trial. Also, because no placebo control group was utilized, the authors of that study could not rule out the possibility that the apparent therapeutic effect from fluoxetine was the result of the placebo effect. To date, only one double-blind, placebo-controlled study of subjects with alcohol or substance abuse has included substantial numbers of suicidal patients. The study involved 51 subjects, of whom 20 (39%) had made a suicide attempt in the current depressive episode, 31 (61%) had made a suicide attempt in their lifetime, and 46 (90%) had reported suicidal ideations in the week before hospitalization. The results of that double. blind, placebo-controlled study suggest that fluoxetine was effective in decreasing but not eliminating both the depressive symptoms (including suicidal ideations) and the level of alcohol consumption among a study group of subjects with comorbid major depressive disorder and alcohol dependence, many of whom displayed suicidal ideations. A secondary data analysis from that study suggested that cigarette smoking is also significantly decreased by fluoxetine, but the magnitude of the decrease is limited and few of these patients totally quit smoking with fluoxetine treatment alone. Another secondary data analysis from that study suggested that marijuana smoking was also significantly decreased in a subgroup of subjects who demonstrated cannabis abuse and that the magnitude of this improvement was robust. A third secondary data analysis from that study suggested that cocaine abuse acts as a predictor of poor outcome for both depressive symptoms (including suicidality) and level of alcohol use in this population. The results of a 1-year naturalistic follow-up study involving the patients from that study suggest that the benefits of fluoxetine in decreasing depressive symptoms and level of drinking persist 1 year after entering the treatment program. To date, no other double-blind, placebo-controlled studies involving substantial numbers of substance-abusing suicidal patients have been reported to either confirm or refute these findings. Further studies are clearly warranted to evaluate the efficacy of various pharmacotherapeutic. agents and various psychotherapies in the treatment of substance-abusing suicidal patients.

TI Geospatial, racial, and educational variation in firearm mortality in
   the USA, Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia, 1990-2015: a comparative analysis
   of vital statistics data
SO LANCET PUBLIC HEALTH

DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; DEATH RATES; SUICIDE
AB Background Firearm mortality is a leading, and largely avoidable, cause of death in the USA, Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia. We aimed to assess the changes over time and demographic determinants of firearm deaths in these four countries between 1990 and 2015.
   Methods In this comparative analysis of firearm mortality, we examined national vital statistics data from 1990-2015 from four publicly available data repositories in the USA, Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia. We extracted medically-certified deaths and underlying population denominators to calculate the age-specific and sex-specific firearm deaths and the risk of firearm mortality at the national and subnational level, by education for all four countries, and by race or ethnicity for the USA and Brazil. Analyses were stratified by intent (homicide, suicide, unintentional, or undetermined). We quantified avoidable mortality for each country using the lowest number of subnational age-specific and period-specific death rates.
   Findings Between 1990 and 2015, 106-3 million medically-certified deaths were recorded, including 2 472 000 firearm deaths, of which 851 000 occurred in the USA, 272 000 in Mexico, 855 000 in Brazil, and 494000 in Colombia. Homicides accounted for most of the firearm deaths in Mexico (225 000 [82.7%]), Colombia (463 000 [93.8%]), and Brazil (766 000 [89.5%]). Suicide accounted for more than half of all firearm deaths in the USA (479000 [56.3%]). In each country, firearm mortality was highest among men aged 15-34 years, accounting for up to half of the total risk of death in that age group. During the study period, firearm mortality risks increased in Mexico and Brazil but decreased in the USA and Colombia, with marked national and subnational geographical variation. Young men with low educational attainment were at increased risk of firearm homicide in all four countries, and in the USA and Brazil, black and brown men, respectively, were at the highest risk. The risk of firearm homicide was 14 times higher in black men in the USA aged 25-34 years with low educational attainment than comparably-educated white men (1.52% [99% CI 1-50-1.54] vs 0.11% [0.10-0.12]), and up to four times higher than in comparably-educated men in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico. In the USA, the risk of firearm homicide was more than 30 times higher in black men with post-secondary education than comparably educated white men. If countries could achieve the same firearm mortality rates nationally as in their lowest-burden states, 1 777 800 firearm deaths at all ages and in both sexes could be avoided, including 1 028 000 deaths in men aged 15-34 years.
   Interpretation Firearm mortality in the USA, Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia is highest among young adult men, and is strongly associated with race and ethnicity, and low education levels. Reductions in firearm deaths would improve life expectancy, particularly for black men in the USA, and would reduce racial and educational disparities in mortality. Copyright (C) 2019 The Author(s).

AB Background: Careful characterization of the phenotype and genotype of Huntington disease (HD) can foster better understanding of the condition.
   Methods: We conducted a cohort study in the United States, Canada, and Australia of members of families affected by HD. We collected demographic and clinical data, conducted the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale and Mini-Mental State Examination, and determined Huntingtin trinucleotide CAG repeat length. We report primarily on cross-sectional baseline data from this recently completed prospective, longitudinal, observational study.
   Results: As of December 31, 2009, 2,318 individuals enrolled; of these, 1,985 (85.6%) were classified into six analysis groups. Three groups had expanded CAG alleles (36 repeats or more): individuals with clinically diagnosed HD [n = 930], and clinically unaffected first-degree relatives who had previously pursued [n = 248] or not pursued [n = 112] predictive DNA testing. Three groups lacked expanded alleles: first-degree relatives who had previously pursued [n = 41] or not pursued [n = 224] genetic testing, and spouses and caregivers [n = 430]. Baseline mean performance differed across groups in all motor, behavioral, cognitive, and functional measures (p<0.001). Clinically unaffected individuals with expanded alleles weighed less (76.0 vs. 79.6 kg; p = 0.01) and had lower cognitive scores (28.5 vs. 29.1 on the Mini Mental State Examination; p = 0.008) than individuals without expanded alleles. The frequency of "high normal" repeat lengths (27 to 35) was 2.5% and repeat lengths associated with reduced penetrance (36 to 39) was 2.7%.
   Conclusion: Baseline analysis of COHORT study participants revealed differences that emerge prior to clinical diagnosis. Longitudinal investigation of this cohort will further characterize the natural history of HD and genetic and biological modifiers.

AB As the number of females served by the juvenile justice system in the United States continues to grow, both in absolute terms and relative to the number of males, it is important to understand both the general and specific characteristics of delinquent girls and boys regarding their patterns of offending and risk variables. Using systematic random sampling, 20% of all admittees to the state-run juvenile detention centers in the state of Connecticut, USA, were included in a chart review study, forming a sample (n = 371, 30.2% girls, age range 11-19 years; mean age = 14.45, sd = 1.05) that was analyzed for gender differences with regard to characteristics of offenses. These characteristics were examined for their potential associations with indicators of risk that are routinely collected at admission to detention. Findings indicate a complex set of associations between indicators of offense and risk, highlighting the importance not only of gender, but also of racial/ethnic differences, whose modulating effects appear to be important in understanding these associations. Specifically, girls in detention are characterized by a number of dimensions, some of which align with those for boys and some that are more gender-specific. For example, girls, as a group, demonstrated higher levels of substance abuse, suicide ideation, victimization, and mental-health variability, but these higher scores are more characteristic of girls from minority backgrounds. More research is needed to understand the profiles of juveniles in detention as the variables considered in this work that map onto the literature at large have resulted in effects of small magnitude.

AB Objective. The objective of this study was to describe fatal cases of traumatic brain injury (TBI) among West Virginia residents.
   Methods. The authors analyzed data from the National Center for Health Statistics Multiple Cause of Death tapes for the period 1989-1998. They compared West Virginia's annualized average TBI death rate with the rates of other states and with the rate among U.S. residents for the same period. U.S. Bureau of Census population estimates were used as denominators.
   Results. A total of 4,416 TBI deaths occurred in West Virginia in 1989-1998, for an annual average death rate of 23.6 per 100,000 population. From 1989 to 1998, TBI death rates declined 5% (p=0.4042). Seventy-five percent (n=3,31 5) of fatalities occurred among men. Adults greater than or equal to65 years of age accounted for the highest percentage of fatal injuries (n= 1,135). The leading external causes of fatal TBI were: firearm-related (39% of reported fatalities), motor vehicles-related (34%), and fall-related (10%). Firearm-related TBI became the leading cause of TBI fatalities in 1991, surpassing motor vehicle-related TBI. Seventy-five percent of firearm-related TBI deaths were suicides (n=1,302). West Virginia's TBI death rate (23.6 per 100,000) was higher than the national rate (20.6 per 100,000). In 23 states, the average TBI death rates over the 10-year period were higher than West Virginia's. Whereas modest declines in TBI death rates occurred for motor vehicle-related and firearm-related causes in West Virginia, a concomitant 38% increase occurred in the fall-related TBI death rate during the decade.
   Conclusion. Data presented in this report can be used to develop targeted prevention programs in West Virginia.

AB Introduction: With the ongoing opioid overdose epidemic in the U.S., it is important to explore how prescription opioid misuse correlates with health behaviors that increase the risk for adverse health outcomes among adolescents. The objective of this study is to determine if lifetime nonmedical use of prescription opioids is associated with health risk behaviors among adolescents.
   Methods: Data from the 2017 nationally representative Youth Risk Behavior Survey (14,765 high school students in Grades 9-12) were used to explore associations between lifetime nonmedical use of prescription opioids and 29 health risk behaviors. Logistic regression models (adjusted for sex, race/ethnicity, grade, and sexual identity) estimated adjusted prevalence ratios and 95% CIs. Analyses were completed in 2018.
   Results: Nonmedical use of prescription opioids was associated with all but 1 of the health risk behaviors included in the analyses. Substance use ranged from adjusted prevalence ratio=2.46 (current alcohol use) to adjusted prevalence ratio=17.52 (heroin use); violence victimization from adjusted prevalence ratio=1.80 (bullied at school) to adjusted prevalence ratio=3.12 (threatened or injured with a weapon); suicidal thoughts/behaviors from adjusted prevalence ratio=2.23 (considered suicide) to adjusted prevalence ratio=3.45 (attempted suicide); and sexual behavior from adjusted prevalence ratio=1.06 (did not use a dual pregnancy prevention method) to adjusted prevalence ratio=3.42 (4 or more sexual partners). Poor academic performance (adjusted prevalence ratio=1.53), receiving an HIV test (adjusted prevalence ratio=1.77), and having persistent feelings of sadness/hopelessness (adjusted prevalence ratio=1.80) were also associated with nonmedical use of prescription opioids.
   Conclusions: Nonmedical use of prescription opioids is associated with many health risk behaviors. Opportunities to reduce nonmedical use of prescription opioids include screening pediatric patients for opioid use disorder, improved prescribing practices, and, from a primary prevention perspective, integrated evidence-based health education programs in schools.

AB Background: Recently, there has been an increase in prescription drug abuse and related fatalities. Although opioid analgesics are commonly implicated, there have been significant increases in the prevalence of benzodiazepine exposures and overdoses. Objective: To describe national trends in pediatric benzodiazepine exposures from 2000 to 2015. Methods: A retrospective database analysis was conducted. Data regarding benzodiazepine exposures in children ages 0 to Results: A total of 296,838 pediatric benzodiazepine exposures were identified during the study period. The rate of pediatric benzodiazepine exposure increased 54% between 2000 and 2015. The severity of medical outcomes also increased, as did the prevalence of co-ingestion of multiple drugs, especially in children ages 12 to <18 years. Nearly half of all reported exposures in 2015 were documented as intentional abuse, misuse, or attempted suicide, reflecting a change from prior years. The most commonly identified pediatric benzodiazepines of exposures were alprazolam, clonazepam, and lorazepam. Conclusions: The rate and severity of reported pediatric benzodiazepine exposure is increasing over time. Adolescent exposures are of specific concern, as co-ingestion and intentional abuse were found to be more common in this group. Medical providers and caretakers should be cognizant of this growing epidemic to avoid preventable harm to adolescents, young children, and infants.

AB This study explored the magnitude and clinical correlates of anxiety in three groups of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD): those with comorbid anxiety disorders (the COM group), those with subthreshold core anxiety disorder symptoms that are the screening items for anxiety disorders on the MINI (the SUB group), and those with neither anxiety disorders nor subthreshold core anxiety disorder symptoms (the NON group). Anxiety symptomatology of 1052 patients from 8 psychiatric settings in mainland China, who met DSM-IV TR criteria for MDD, was assessed using the MINI. The presence of core anxiety symptoms was determined by patient endorsement of any screening item of panic disorder, agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, or generalized anxiety disorder. The prevalences of comorbid subthreshold core anxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders were 13% and 28.7%, respectively. The SUB and COM cases showed similar patterns of clinical presentation. Both were more likely than the NON cases to be characterized by younger age, concurrent dysthymia and OCD, suicidal ideation and attempted suicides. These findings highlight the importance of assessing both anxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders in the presence of MDD, and suggest the need for novel assessments capable of addressing different levels of anxiety in depressed patients.

AB Objective: Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), a protozoan parasite that persists in host tissues, including brain, has been associated with several psychiatric disorders and with suicidal behavior. We sought to test the hypothesis that latent T. gondii infection, as manifest by circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to T. gondii, is associated with both categorical and dimensional measures of aggression.
   Method: IgG antibodies to T. gondii were collected between 1991 and 2008 from 358 adult subjects with DSM-5 intermittent explosive disorder (IED), non-IED psychiatric disorders (psychiatric controls), or no evidence of any psychiatric diagnosis (healthy controls). Assessments of aggression, anger, and impulsivity, as well as state/trait anger, depression, and anxiety were completed. T. gondii seropositive status (IgG > 12 IU) was the primary outcome measure for this study.
   Results: T. gondii seropositive status (IgG > 12 IU) was associated with higher aggression (P = .022) and impulsivity (P = .05) scores. When both aggression and impulsivity scores were controlled for, however, only aggression scores were higher in seropositive subjects (P = .011). In addition, T. gondii seropositive status and marginal mean +/- SE aggression scores increased from healthy controls (9.1% and -0.66 +/- 0.05) to psychiatric controls (16.7% and -0.27 +/- 0.05) to subjects with IED (21.8% and 1.15 +/- 0.06; P = .05). These findings were not accounted for by the presence of other syndromal/personality disorders or by states or traits related to depressed or anxious moods.
   Conclusions: These data are consistent with previous studies suggesting a relationship between T. gondii and self-directed aggression (ie, suicidal behavior) and further add to the biological complexity of impulsive aggression both from a categorical and a dimensional perspective.

AB Background. There has been noticed a systematic growth of using psychoactive substance (SP) in last years. The co-occurrence of mental and physical disorders related to substance abuse of treated patients is more often a serious problem to medical services. Dual diagnosis (DD) is a clinical term referring to co-morbidity or the co-occurrence in the same individual of a psychoactive substance use disorder and another psychiatric disorder. The aim of the study is to investigate the prevalence of dual diagnosis in patients with diagnosis of substance use disorder hospitalized in years 1994-2005, to assess the kind of co-morbid mental disorders and the course of treatment in three groups: patients with DD, with diagnosis of mental disorder without substance use and with diagnosis related to substance use.
   Methods. The retrospective study of 4 349 case records of patients hospitalized in the department of psychiatry in years 1994-2005. Out of this number two groups of patients were separated: persons abusing or dependent on SP (n = 825) and patients with dual diagnosis (n = 362). The control group (n = 200) was created among patients with mental disorders and without SP abuse. Socio-demographic factors, number and the length of hospitalizations, aggressive behaviours, suicide attempts, discharges from hospital on demand were analyzed. In the DD group there was an attempt to evaluate the relation between substance use disorders and co-occuring mental disorders performed.
   Results. The frequency of DD among all patients hospitalized in the studied period of time was 8.3%, whereas among patients abusing SP was 30.5%. This study demonstrates that patients with the DD are statistically longer hospitalized, discharged from hospitals at their own request and more often need treatment in hospitals, statistically more often try to commit suicide and perform aggressive behavior. Mental disorders were substantially often secondary to substance related disorders in the DD group. There was proved that patients mainly abused alcohol and the most frequent mental disorder were mood (affective) disorders.

AB Objective: To compare risk of suicide ideation and attempts in adolescents with 1) gay, lesbian, or bisexual (GLB) identity, 2) "unsure" identity, or 3) heterosexual identity with same-sex attraction/fantasy or behavior, to heterosexual identity without same-sex attraction/fantasy or behavior. Method: A total of 1,856 students 14 years of age and older from 14 public and private high schools in Montreal, Quebec, were surveyed anonymously. The survey included items assessing sexual orientation, health risk behaviors, and suicidal ideation and attempts. Multiple logistic regression models were used to assess risk factors for suicidal ideation and attempts. Results: In all, 58 (3.1%) adolescents self-identified as GLB, 59 (3.2%) as unsure, and 115 (6.2%) as heterosexual with same-sex attraction/ fantasy or behavior. Compared with heterosexually identified youth without same-sex attraction/fantasy or behavior (N = 1,624; 87.59%), in multivariable analyses, 12-month suicidal ideation was significantly higher for both GLB (odds ratio [OR] = 2.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.22-4.37) and unsure youth (OR = 2.64, 95% CI = 1.38-5.08). Twelve-month suicide attempts were significantly elevated for GLB youth (OR = 2.23, 95%, CI = 1.15-4.35) and high, although not statistically significant, for unsure youth (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 0.77-3.36). Heterosexual identity with same-sex attraction/ fantasy or behavior was not significantly associated with increased suicidal ideation (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 0.76-2.08) or attempts (OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.55-1.91) in multivariable analyses. Conclusion: Compared with heterosexual youth without same-sex attraction/ fantasy or behavior, adolescents with GLB and unsure identities were at greater risk of suicidality. However, youth who reported same-sex attraction or behavior but a heterosexual identity were not at elevated risk. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 2010;49(2):104-113.

AB Background. Worldwide 350 million people suffer from major depression, with the majority of cases occurring in lowand middle-income countries. We examined the patterns, correlates and care-seeking behaviour of adults suffering from major depressive episode (MDE) in China.
   Method. A nationwide study recruited 512 891 adults aged 30-79 years from 10 provinces across China during 20042008. The 12-month prevalence of MDE was assessed by the Modified Composite International Diagnostic Interviewshort form. Logistic regression yielded adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of MDE associated with socio-economic, lifestyle and health-related factors and major stressful life events.
   Results. Overall, 0.7% of participants had MDE and a further 2.4% had major depressive symptoms. Stressful life events were strongly associated with MDE [adjusted OR 14.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 13.7-15.7], with a dose-response relationship with the number of such events experienced. Family conflict had the highest OR for MDE (18.9, 95% CI 16.8-21.2) among the 10 stressful life events. The risk of MDE was also positively associated with rural residency (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.4-1.7), low income (OR 2.3, 95% CI 2.1-2.4), living alone (OR 2.6, 95% CI 2.3-3.0), smoking (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.3-1.6) and certain other mental disorders (e.g. anxiety, phobia). Similar, albeit weaker, associations were observed with depressive symptoms. Among those with MDE, about 15% sought medical help or took psychiatric medication, 15% reported having suicidal ideation and 6% reported attempting suicide.
   Conclusions. Among Chinese adults, the patterns and correlates of MDE were generally consistent with those observed in the West. The low rates of seeking professional help and treatment highlight the great gap in mental health services in China.

AB The present investigation examined the explanatory role of anxiety sensitivity in the relation between experiential avoidance and anxious arousal, depressive, and suicidal symptoms among Latinos seeking health services at a primary healthcare facility. Participants included 138 adult Latinos (86.2 % female; M-age = 38.4, SD = 10.8 and 97.8 % used Spanish as their first language). Results indicated that experiential avoidance was indirectly related to anxious arousal, depressive, and suicidal symptoms through anxiety sensitivity. These observed effects were evident above and beyond the variance accounted for by gender, marital status, educational level, employment status, and negative affectivity. Tests of model specificity [reversing the posited explanatory variable (anxiety sensitivity) and dependent variable(s), respectively] indicated that experiential avoidance is related to anxiety sensitivity, which in turn, is associated with anxious arousal and suicidal symptoms. In regard to depressive symptoms, the relation between experiential avoidance and anxiety sensitivity appears to be reciprocal. The present findings suggest that there is indeed merit in focusing further scientific attention on the interplay between experiential avoidance and anxiety sensitivity in regard to better understanding and possibly intervening to reduce anxiety/depressive vulnerability among Latinos in primary care settings.

AB Objective: We aimed to assess the presence of suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms and symptoms of hopelessness in three healthcare training programs. Method: The study's population comprised all students enrolled at the Medical School of the Fundacao do ABC, Brazil, from 2006 to 2007 compared to students enrolled in nursing and pharmacy programs. We applied the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, the Beck Depression Inventory and the Beck Hopeless Scale to assess psychiatric symptomatology. The general response rates of the medical, nursing, and pharmacy students were 56%, 56% and 61%, respectively. Results: There was no difference regarding the presence of suicidal ideation among medical, nursing and pharmacy students. There was also no difference regarding the presence of either depression or hopelessness in medical students in comparison to nursing and pharmacy students. In comparison to nursing and pharmacy students, significantly higher severity rates of hopelessness were observed among medical students. Conclusion: Although we did not observe significant differences regarding suicidal ideation and depression among the three healthcare programs students, our findings suggest that the presence of suicidal ideation is indeed a source of concern. Early identification of these symptoms is crucial in order to offer appropriate support and treatment and prevent deaths by suicide.

DT Article
ID OCCUPATIONAL INJURIES; UNITED-STATES; AUSTRALIA
AB Aims. To determine the number and rates of work-related fatal injuries by employment status, occupation, industry, age and gender in New Zealand 1985-1994.
   Methods. Potential cases of work-related injury deaths of persons aged 15-84 years were identified from the national electronic mortality data files. Main exclusions were deaths due to suicide and deaths due to motor vehicle crashes. The circumstances of the deaths of each fatal incident meeting inclusion criteria were then reviewed directly from coronial files to determine work-relatedness.
   Results. The rate of work-related fatal injury in New Zealand was 5.03/100 000 workers per year for the study period. There was a significant decline in crude rate over the study period. However, this was in substantial part accounted for by changes in occupation and industry mix. Older workers, male workers, self-employed workers, and particular occupational groups, all had substantially elevated rates. Agricultural and helicopter pilots, forestry workers and fishery workers had the highest rates. Farmers, forestry workers, and fishery workers also had high numbers of deaths, together accounting for nearly 40% of all deaths.
   Conclusions. This study has demonstrated that work-related fatal injury remains a pressing problem for New Zealand. Several areas in urgent need of prevention efforts were highlighted.

AB Although advances in pharmacotherapy have enabled people living with HIV/AIDS to live longer, fuller lives, some leave medical care, resulting in sub-optimal treatment and increased health risk to themselves and others. Forty-one patients who dropped out of an urban, publically funded primary care HIV clinic were contacted and encouraged by outreach staff to return. Participants were interviewed within two weeks of returning, and themes associated with dropping out and returning were elicited and content analyzed. Dropping out was associated with drug/alcohol use, unstable housing/homelessness, psychiatric disorders, incarceration, problems with HIV medications, inability to accept the diagnosis, relocation, stigma, problems with the clinic, and forgetfulness. Returning was associated with health concerns, substance abuse treatment/recovery, stable housing, incarceration/release, positive feelings about the clinic, spirituality, and assistance from family/relocation. Because a large number of patients reported substance abuse, depression, and past suicide attempts. Clinic staff should assess substance use, depression, and suicidal ideation at each primary care visit and encourage patients to obtain substance abuse treatment and mental health care. Future interventions could include providing SBIRT and/or onsite mental health and substance abuse treatment, all of which may boost retention.

AB There are six HIV prevention programs for homeless youth whose efficacy has been or is currently being evaluated: STRIVE, the Community Reinforcement Approach, Strengths-Based Case Management, Ecologically-Based Family Therapy, Street Smart, and AESOP (street outreach access to resources). Programs vary in their underlying framework and theoretical models for understanding homelessness. All programs presume that the youths' families lack the ability to support their adolescent child. Some programs deemphasize family involvement while others focus on rebuilding connections among family members. The programs either normalize current family conflicts or, alternatively, provide education about the importance of parental monitoring. All programs aim to reduce HIV-related sexual and drug use acts. A coping skills approach is common across programs: Problem-solving skills are specifically addressed in four of the six programs; alternatively, parents in other programs are encouraged to contingently reward their children. Each program also engineers ongoing social support for the families and the youth, either by providing access to needed resources or by substituting a new, supportive relationship for the existing family caretaker. All of the interventions provide access to health and mental health services as basic program resources. A comparison of HIV prevention programs for homeless youth identifies the robust components of each and suggests which programs providers may choose to replicate.

AB Aim: To assess the aggregate association between alcohol consumption and violence, while controlling for potential confounders. Design and measurements: The data comprise aggregate time-series for Norway in the period 1880-2003 and 1911-2003 on criminal violence rates and per capita alcohol consumption. Possible confounders comprise annual rates of unemployment, divorce, marriage, total fertility rate, gross national product, public assistance/social care and the proportion of the population aged between 15 and 25. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) analyses were performed on differenced data. Both semilogarithmic and linear models were estimated. Findings: Alcohol consumption was associated significantly with violence, and an increase in alcohol consumption of 1 litre per year per inhabitant predicted a change of approximately 8% in the violence rate. The parameter estimate for the alcohol variable remained unaltered after including the covariates both in the semilogarithmic and the linear models. Of the seven covariates included in the models, only divorce was associated significantly with violence rate. Conclusions: The results suggest that alcohol consumption has an independent effect on violence rates when other factors are controlled for. The results support the assumption of a causal effect of alcohol consumption on violence, and it appears that alcohol consumption is an important factor when we wish to explain changes in violence rates over time.

TI Prevalence of adults who are the targets of parental alienating

ID DARK TRIAD; AGGRESSION
AB Estimating the prevalence of parental alienation is challenging because not all children who are exposed to parental alienating behaviors become alienated (Harman, Bernet, & Harman, 2019). The purpose of the current study was to determine whether the proportion of adults who indicate being alienated from a child will be similar to results from a previous poll of North Carolina adults (Harman, Leder-Elder, & Biringen, 2016) using three nationally representative on-line survey panels from United States and Canada, and to determine the mental health impact of parental alienating behaviors. Results from the first two polls indicate that the prevalence of parents who feel they are being alienated from their children is higher than originally estimated: 35.5% (of 273) in the U.S. and 32% (of 397) in Canada. Using another means of assessment for the third poll, 39.1% (of 594) of parents in the US are the non-reciprocating targets of parental alienating behaviors, which is over 22 million parents and confirms previous estimates that did not differentiate between reciprocating and non-reciprocating parents (Harman et al., 2016). Of these, 6.7% of the parents had children who were moderately to severely alienated, which is at least 1.3% of the US population. Alienated parents also had high levels of depression, trauma symptoms, and risk for suicide. Ramifications of these findings for researchers and practitioners are discussed.

   DISEASE; MORBIDITY
AB PURPOSE: Many health outcomes exhibit seasonal variation in incidence, including accidents, suicides, and infections. For seasonal outcomes it can be difficult to distinguish the causal roles played by factors that also vary seasonally, such as weather, air pollution, and pathogen circulation.
   METHODS: Various approaches to estimating the association between a seasonal exposure and a seasonal outcome in ecologic Studies are reviewed, using studies of influenza-related mortality as an example. Because mortality rates vary seasonally and circulation of other respiratory viruses peaks during influenza season, it is a challenge to estimate which winter deaths were caused by influenza. Results of studies that estimated the contribution of influenza to all-cause mortality using different methods on the same data are compared.
   RESULTS: Methods for estimating associations between season exposures and outcomes vary greatly in their advantages, disadvantages, and assumptions. Even when applied to identical data, different methods can give greatly different results for the expected contribution of influenza to all-cause mortality.
   CONCLUSIONS: When the association between exposures and outcomes that vary seasonally is estimated, models must be selected carefully, keeping in mind the assumptions inherent in each model. Ann Epidemiol 12009;19:681-691. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Pediatric Poisonings and Risk Markers for Hospital Admission in a Major

AB To identify the prevalence, characteristics, and risk markers for childhood poisonings treated in the emergency department of a large Romanian hospital. Trauma registry data using ICD-10 codes and case summaries were studied to identify poisonings among children aged 0-18. Multivariate logistic regression identified factors associated with hospital admission. Between 1999 and 2003, 1,173 pediatric trauma cases were seen in the emergency department; 437 (37.3%) were treated for poisoning, including medication (35%), alcohol (26%), chemical products (19%), and carbon monoxide (14%). Half of all poisonings were unintentional, primarily affecting children < 10 years. Half were intentional, mainly affecting children 10-18. Females were three times more likely than males to have documented suicidal intent (P < .0001). Over 30% of suicide attempts were among children ages 10-14 (P < .0001). We report significantly increased adjusted odds ratios (P < .05) of hospital admission for children 10-18, and for chemical substance poisoning, and suicidal intent. Pediatric poisoning is a serious public health issue in Romania, and we suggest these findings are relevant across other eastern European countries with limited resources. Poisonings result in morbidity and hospital admissions, yet there are few prevention resources available. Health education programs and consumer product safety policies are needed in Romania and eastern Europe.

AB Purpose: This study reviews the epidemiology of pediatric firearm deaths in North Carolina and estimates the time from the retail sale of guns to their involvement in pediatric firearm deaths.
   Methods: The authors reviewed autopsy reports for all children 0 to 14 years of age that died of firearm-related injuries in North Carolina from January 1999 through December 2002. Data obtained included demographic information, firearm type, and manner of death. Data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which traced guns involved in crimes and determined the time elapsed from purchase to their involvement in a crime (ie, time-to-crime were also reviewed).
   Results: During the study period, 40 children died of firearm injuries. Mean age was 7.6 years. Handguns were responsible for the majority of deaths (59%) followed by shotguns (27%), rifles (10%), and undetermined cause (10%). Most deaths were homicides (67%) followed by unintentional death (18%), suicide (13%), and undetermined cause (2%). Most crime guns (76%) were purchased legally, and many (40%) had a time-to-crime of less than 3 years.
   Conclusions: Legally purchased firearms pose a significant threat to children in North Carolina. A more restrictive approach to the sale of handguns is a logical approach to reducing pediatric firearm-related deaths in the United States. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background Tobacco use among members of the US military service is unacceptably high, resulting in substantial healthcare and personnel costs. Support of military command is critical to the success of tobacco control policies because line commanders are responsible for implementation and enforcement. This study is the first to examine US military line commanders' perspectives about current tobacco control policies and the impact of tobacco on readiness.
   Methods We conducted key-informant interviews with 20 officers at the US Army's Command and General Staff College about military tobacco use and tobacco control policy.
   Results Participants identified the long-term impact of tobacco use on military members, but were unaware of proximal effects on health and readiness other than lost productivity due to smoke breaks. Officers also discussed nicotine addiction and the logistics of ensuring that an addicted population had access to tobacco. Regarding policy, most knew about regulations governing smoke-free areas and were open to stronger restrictions, but were unaware of current policies governing prevention, intervention and product sales.
   Conclusions Findings suggest that strong policy that takes advantage of the hierarchical and disciplined nature of the military, supported by senior line and civilian leadership up to and including the secretaries of the services and the Secretary of Defense, will be critical to substantially diminishing tobacco use by military personnel.

AB Epidemiological research on the prevalence of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) has found inconsistent results in terms of gender differences, with some studies showing a higher prevalence for women compared to men and other studies showing no difference. The goal of the current study was to use meta-analytic techniques to better conceptualize the presence and size of gender differences in the prevalence of NSSI. We also examined two factors proposed to explain gender differences in NSSI prevalence: the gender difference would be larger for clinical samples relative to community samples, and the gender difference would be larger for younger (versus older) samples. The results showed that across studies women were significantly more likely to report a history of NSSI than men. Moderator analyses showed that the gender difference was larger for clinical samples, compared to college/community samples. However, there was not a significant relation between age and effect size. Women were more likely to use some methods of NSSI (e.g., cutting) compared to men, but for other methods there was no significant difference (e.g., punching). These results increase our knowledge of NSSI and fit with a larger literature examining gender, emotion regulation, and psychopathology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background and purpose: To prospectively investigate causes of death and the circumstances surrounding death in 302 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The functional status of patients immediately before death was also determined. Methods: Information was obtained from neurologists at ALS centres, patients' files, and, when deaths occurred outside a medical facility, attending physicians. Results: Most patients (63%) died in a medical facility. The most frequently reported cause of death was respiratory failure (77%), including terminal respiratory insufficiency (58%), pneumonia (14%), asphyxia due to a foreign body (3%) and pulmonary embolism (2%). Ten per cent of patients died from other causes: post-surgical or traumatic conditions (5%), cardiac causes (3.4%), suicide (1.3%) and sudden death of unknown origin (0.7%). The cause of death could not be determined in 13% of cases (6% inside a medical facility and 25% outside). At the time of death, only 55% of patients were receiving riluzole, 33% were undergoing non-invasive ventilation, 3% had a tracheotomy and 37% a gastrostomy. Conclusion: The information provided by this study helps to improve our understanding of the natural history of the disease and may help optimize the quality of care we can offer patients at the end of life.

AB In 2011 the oldest baby boomers will turn age 65. Although healthcare researchers have started to examine the future preparedness of the healthcare system for the elderly, psychiatric emergency services ( PES) have been widely overlooked. Research is needed to address PES need and demand by older patients, assess the consequences of this need or demand, and establish recommendations to guide PES planning and practice. The authors examined journal articles, review articles, textbooks, and electronic databases related to these topics. The authors outline the current PES environment in terms of facilities, characteristics, and visits, and discuss current geriatric patient PES use. Factors expected to impact future use are examined, including sociodemographic characteristics, psychiatric illness prevalence, cohort effects, medical comorbidity, mental healthcare resources and utilization, and stigma. Consequences of these on future psychiatric care and well-being of the elderly are then explored, specifically, greater acute services need, more suicide, strained delivery systems, increased hospitalization, and greater costs. The following are proposed to address likely future PES shortcomings: enhance service delivery, increase training, standardize and improve PES, prioritize finances, and promote research. The degree to which the geriatric mental healthcare "crisis" develops will be inversely related to the current system's response to predictable future needs.

AB Studies of the prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders have shown that there is a high prevalence of comorbidity of these 2 disorders. The resulting disability and burden affect not only the individual in terms of decreased productivity, but the level of health care utilization is also increased. The objective of this article is to look at the epidemiology, disability, and global burden of depression and anxiety across the different nations of the world. This article will concentrate on the results from the Cross-National Collaborative Group. The transcultural trends in prevalence and disability presented here must be viewed in the light of the limitations of the study, such as methodology and population sampling, uniformity in the method of clinical assessment, and the collection and processing of data. New studies of depression and anxiety among different cultures are currently in progress in the form of the European Study of Epidemiology on Mental Disorders (ESEMeD), which is closely linked to the World Health Organization (WHO) World Mental Health 2000 initiative. The methodology for ESEMeD is similar to that of the WHO World Mental Health 2000 study, which will facilitate comparisons between the results for Europe and the rest of the world. Results of these studies are awaited with anticipation.

AB Objective Promoting mental health and preventing mental health problems are important tasks for international organizations and nations. Such goals entail the establishment of active information networks and effective systems and indicators to assess the mental health of populations. This being said, there is a need in Korea develop ways to measure the state of mental health in Korea.
   Methods This paper reviews the mental health indicator development policies and practices of seven organizations, countries, and regions: WHO, OECD, EU, United States, Australia, UK, and Scotland. Using Delphi method, we conducted two surveys of mental health indicators for experts in the field of mental health. The survey questionnaire included 5 domains: mental health status, mental health factor, mental health system, mental health service, and quality of mental health services. We considered 124 potential mental health indicators out of more than 600 from indicators of international organizations and foreign countries.
   Results We obtained the top 30 mental health indicators from the surveys. Among them, 10 indicators belong to the mental health system. The most important five mental health indicators are suicide rate, rate of increase in mental disorder treatment, burden caused by mental disorders, adequacy of identifying problems of mental health projects and deriving solutions, and annual prevalence of mental disorders.
   Conclusion Our study provides information about the process for indicator development and the use of survey results to measure the mental health status of the Korean population. The aim of mental health indicator development is to improve the mental health system by better grasping the current situation. We suggest these mental health indicators can monitor progress in efforts to implement reform policies, provide community services, and involve users, families and other stakeholders in mental health promotion, prevention, care and rehabilitation.

AB In the United States, hospice and palliative care are two distinct expressions of the hospice interdisciplinary team approach to, end-of-life care, which originated in Great Britain in the 1960s. The hospice movement, developed largely as a home-care program and alternative to conventional care. Hospice regulations and reimbursement allowances limit services to patients,who,are expected to die within 6 months and who forego many common oncologic treatments. On the other hand, palliative care is a more recent academic, medically mainstream discipline that attempts to integrate the hospice approach into oncology and other areas of clinical medicine from the earliest phases of diagnosis and treatment. Palliative care entertains all appropriate forms of care at any phase of an illness. In this review, we describe the key goals of palliative care, which include excellent pain and symptom control, psychosocial and spiritual support for the patient and family, informed decision-making, and coordinated services across the continuum, of care. We focus on selected recent developments that are important to oncology practice: the role of artificial nutrition; management of malignant small bowel obstruction; communication tasks, such as information sharing, recognition of patient preferences, advanced-care planning, and bereavement care; and ethical principles related to the hastening of death.

AB Background: American Indian adults are more likely to experience co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders than adults of other racial/ethnic groups and are disproportionately burdened by the most common sexually transmitted infections, namely chlamydia and gonorrhea. Several behavioral interventions are proven efficacious in lowering risk for sexually transmitted infection in various populations and, if adapted to address barriers experienced by American Indian adults who suffer from mental health and substance use problems, may be useful for dissemination in American Indian communities. The proposed study aims to examine the efficacy of an adapted evidence-based intervention to increase condom use and decrease sexual risk-taking and substance use among American Indian adults living in a reservation-based community in the Southwestern United States.
   Methods/Design: The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of an adapted evidence-based intervention compared to a control condition. Participants will be American Indian adults ages 18-49 years old who had a recent episode of binge substance use and/or suicide ideation. Participants will be randomized to the intervention, a two-session risk-reduction counseling intervention or the control condition, optimized standard care. All participants will be offered a self-administered sexually transmitted infection test. Participants will complete assessments at baseline, 3 and 6 months follow-up. The primary outcome measure is condom use at last sex.
   Discussion: This is one of the first randomized controlled trials to assess the efficacy of an adapted evidence-based intervention for reducing sexual risk behaviors among AI adults with substance use and mental health problems. If proven successful, there will be an efficacious program for reducing risk behaviors among high-risk adults that can be disseminated in American Indian communities as well as other rural and under-resourced health systems.

AB Death notification is an important skill for health care providers to carry out, yet few clinicians feel adequately prepared to complete this task. To address these gaps in clinical training, some medical educators have incorporated standardized patients (SPs) into the curriculum to allow students to practice death notification in a safe, controlled environment. Veterinary educators agree that end-of-life communication skills are essential for success in clinical practice, and many rely on standardized clients (SCs) for role-play concerning euthanasia. However, anticipatory loss is distinct from unexpected death, and death notification is strikingly absent from the veterinary literature. To introduce students to death notification, Midwestern University College of Veterinary Medicine (MWU CVM) developed a communications curriculum that culminated in a scripted encounter, "Basil, the Scottish Fold." Students must explain to an SC that his kitten died following routine ovariohysterectomy. Pre- and post-event surveys completed by 19 students demonstrated valuable lessons in death notification word choice, particularly what not to say. I hope that this teaching tool may be adapted for use by other colleges of veterinary medicine to allow students to practice death notification.

AB Objectives This study aimed to investigate how trauma characteristics and outcomes differ between genders in a rural hospital.
   Methods Records of trauma patients admitted to a state emergency department (ED) in eastern Turkey, between January 2006 and December 2007 were reviewed and data were analysed based on gender.
   Results In total, 5379 (87.0%) men and 806 (13.0%) women, totalling 6185 patients, were assessed. Mean age was 26.5 (1 month - 80 years) years for men and 24.7 (2 month - 81 years) years for women. Men comprised 90.2%, 81.3% and 77.3% of the patients injured by assault, motor vehicle incidents and falls, respectively. Women comprised a significantly larger share of suicide attempts (70.8%) than men. Of the men injured, 90.6% were discharged after treatment in the ED. The per cent of hospitalised women (5.8%) was increased compared with the per cent of hospitalised men (p=0.011). There was a higher frequency of transfer among women (8.6%) when compared with men (p<0.001). Women had a mortality frequency of 1.2%, which was similar to the mortality per cent calculated for men.
   Conclusions Men were at an increased risk for trauma, especially assault. The percentage of women injured and admitted to the ED due to assault was low compared with statistics reported in the literature. However, assault is the most common cause of trauma among women. The high per cent of hospitalisation and transfer among women may indicate that women are exposed to more severe trauma, and therefore experience increased morbidity compared with men.

AB Studying changing attitudes toward marriage rights in the United States, we consider how sexual and gender socialization and changes in values and beliefs regarding homosexuality and marriage influence lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning (LGBTQ) youth. We begin by presenting the cultural environment of policies, court decisions, and political maneuvers in response to the question of "same-sex" marriage. In this context, we examine fluctuations of public opinion polling from 1989 to 2009. These issues background our main focus, which is to comment on the emerging, positive research on the resiliency, strength, and future aspirations of LGBTQ youth. Such research was begun in the late-1980s with a significant community-based, ethnographic study on LGBTQ youth in Chicago. Although similar studies are being done now, more ethnographic research is necessary to build a catalog of data focused on positive traits in response to a deficiency model used in most psychological research on LGBTQ youth. We end by suggesting ways that psychological anthropologists might fruitfully engage with policy studies and advocates through such research [bisexual, cohort effect, culture drift, gay, LGBTQ, lesbian, marriage, same-sex marriage, public policy, politics, queer, trans, youth attitudes]
