LA English
DT Article
DE suicide; unemployment; gender
ID UNEMPLOYMENT; RISK
AB Background and objectives: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the impact of gender and employment on suicide with the use of expanded unemployment statuses as covariates.
   Methods: Data were obtained from release 5 of the National Longitudinal Mortality Study, a prospective study of deaths in the United States. Proportional hazards regression models were fitted to the data based on follow-up from 1990 to 2011.
   Results: Unemployment was significantly associated with suicide (ARR=1.628, 95% CI=1.356, 1.954), and men had suicide deaths that were five times greater than women (ARR=5.104, 95% CI=4.565, 5.707), however when the sample was stratified by sex, the impact of unemployment on suicide was much higher among women (ARR=2.988, 95% CI=2.045, 4.366) than among men (ARR=1.393, 95% CI=1.131, 1.717).
   Conclusion: Contrary to many findings and gender assumptions, unemployed women in the U.S. have higher deaths from suicide than unemployed men. Discussion focused on explanations for gender disparities in unemployment.

   SELECTION; TRENDS
AB Background
   Suicide has been decreasing over the past decade. However, we do not know whether socioeconomic inequality in suicide has been decreasing as well.
   Aims
   We assessed recent trends in socioeconomic inequalities in suicide in 15 European populations.
   Method
   The DEMETRIQ study collected and harmonised register-based data on suicide mortality follow-up of population censuses, from 1991 and 2001, in European populations aged 35-79. Absolute and relative inequalities of suicide according to education were computed on more than 300 million person-years.
   Results
   In the 1990s, people in the lowest educational group had 1.82 times more suicides than those in the highest group. In the 2000s, this ratio increased to 2.12. Among men, absolute and relative inequalities were substantial in both periods and generally did not decrease over time, whereas among women inequalities were absent in the first period and emerged in the second.
   Conclusions
   The World Health Organization (WHO) plan for Fair opportunity of mental wellbeing' is not likely to be met. (C) The Royal College of Psychiatrists 2018.

AB Suicidal trends and related characteristics such as sociodemographic factors, psychological factors, and health behaviors can differ between countries. This study investigated the predictors of suicidal ideation and attempted suicide including health behaviors among American and Korean youth from two national representative data sets. In both countries, depression was the most predominant predictor to suicidal ideation and attempted suicide. Unique predictors of suicidal youth in each country were also found. In America, attempted suicide was predicted by poor body image, whereas in Korea attempted suicide was predicted by medical diagnosis such as asthma, concern about weight, and alcohol consumption. The value of our approach lies in the comparative analysis of analogous and unique characteristics of suicidal youths in these two huge data sets from different countries. These results should be helpful for school and mental health care providers to plan interventions for youth at risk of suicide to prevent suicidal completion in these nations.

TI Comparing US Army Suicide Cases to a Control Sample: Initial Data and

AB Identification of risk and protective factors for suicide is a priority for the United States military, especially in light of the recent steady increase in military suicide rates. The Department of Defense Suicide Event Report contains comprehensive data on suicides for active duty military personnel, but no analogous control data is available to permit identification of factors that differentially determine suicide risk. This proof-of-concept study was conducted to determine the feasibility of collecting such control data. The study employed a prospective case-control design in which control cases were randomly selected from a large Army installation at a rate of four control participants for every qualifying Army suicide. Although 111 Army suicides were confirmed during the study period, just 27 control soldiers completed the study. Despite the small control sample, preliminary analyses comparing suicide cases to controls identified several factors more frequently reported for suicide cases, including recent failed intimate relationships, outpatient mental health history, mood disorder diagnosis, substance abuse history, and prior self-injury. No deployment-related risk factors were found. These data are consistent with existing literature and form a foundation for larger control studies. Methodological lessons learned regarding study design and recruitment are discussed to inform future studies.

AB Objective: Residents are at a higher risk than the general population for the development of stress-related problems, depression, or suicide. The authors describe a curriculum for educating PGY-1s and residency program directors about physician impairment. Methods: A resident wellness program was established with the goals of preventing resident suicide, encouraging acceptance of treatment where appropriate, preventing self-prescribing, and aiding in stress management. Results: The curriculum was rated highly by residents in the areas of program content and usefulness. Conclusions: Residents are receptive to education on physician impairment. Institutional support is necessary for effectively addressing these concerns with trainees.

DE Blood Alcohol Concentration; Suicide; Motor Vehicle Crash
ID DEATH REPORTING SYSTEM; UNITED-STATES; INTOXICATION; BEHAVIOR; INJURY
AB BackgroundUsing postmortem data, we examined the hypotheses that high (and very high) blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) are more common among motor vehicle crash decedents (MVCs) than among suicide decedents, whereas low alcohol levels are more common among suicides.
   MethodsWe examined BAC in 224 suicide decedents and 166 MVCs ages 18 to 54 in the state of New Mexico in 2012. Comparisons between the groups were made based on differing BAC levels using 0.080g/dl categories including low (0.001 to 0.079g/dl), high (0.080 to 0.159g/dl), and very high BAC (0.160g/dl), and based on 0.100g/dl categories including low (0.001 to 0.099g/dl), high (0.100 to 0.199g/dl), and very high BAC (0.200g/dl), with these groups compared with a no-alcohol reference (0.000g/dl) in separate analyses. Multivariate logistic regressions compared suicides with MVCs that adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity.
   ResultsSupport for the hypothesis that suicides are more likely to have a low BAC level was supported in the analysis using the 0.100g/dl categorizations. Neither analysis supported the hypothesis that MVCs are more likely to have high (or very high) BACs compared with suicides. Among both injury groups with positive BACs, low BACs were least common.
   ConclusionsLow BAC levels may be more likely to be observed among suicides compared with MVCs, a possible reflection of the more varied role that alcohol plays in suicide compared with MVC. Nonetheless, high (and very high) BAC is the predominant scenario in both suicides and MVCs with positive BAC.

AB This study examined interrelations among suicide prevalence, affluence, intelligence, pace of life, and helping behavior on the level of aggregate analysis, both cross-nationally and within the USA, using four extant data sets (8, 15, and 29 Countries; and 17 U.S. states) for the latter two variables. Pertaining to the association of suicide rates with pace of life, the results replicated discrepant previous findings of Lester. Across nations, suicide is more prevalent in populations living in faster environments, whereas within the USA suicide rates are higher in slower environments. Further, seen from an international perspective, there appears to be a nexus of variables, Such that more people tend to commit suicide in the more affluent and faster environments which are populated by more intelligent, but less friendly, individuals. Within the USA, the direction of the correlations of suicide prevalence with these four variables is exactly reversed. Possible reasons for these opposed findings and implications for research are discussed.

AB Objective: Suicide is a significant public and mental health crisis in the United States. Training providers in suicide assessment and response is designated as one of the primary strategies for reducing deaths by suicide. Research has established that suicide intervention training is effective, but little work has been published on potential mediators of skill development and use.
   Method: Secondary data analysis of a randomized trial of the Question, Persuade, and Refer gatekeeper training with master of social work students. Path analysis was used to estimate mediated effects of knowledge, attitudes, reluctance, and self-efficacy on behavior outcomes.
   Results: Results suggest improvements in posttraining measures for knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, reluctance, and the use of gatekeeper behaviors, but there was no supporting evidence for the presence of mediated effects on behavior. Only self-efficacy demonstrated a strong direct relationship with gatekeeper behaviors.
   Conclusions: Ongoing evaluation is needed with an added interest in self-efficacy and how it can be enhanced through training.

AB Reducing mental health stigma and perceived barriers to care is a necessary strategy for addressing the public health problem of suicide among the United States Armed Forces. The purpose of this study was threefold: (a) to empirically evaluate the principal component structure of the Perceived Barriers to Care (PBTC) measure; (b) to gain an understanding of the perceived barriers to seeking mental health services among Marine Corps noncommissioned officers (NCOs) selected to participate in a primary suicide prevention training program, Never Leave a Marine Behind (NLMB); and (c) to explore the relationship among sex, education, prior exposure to suicide within one's military unit, and perceived barriers to seeking mental health services. The data for the PBTC (N = 1,758) were drawn from a previously performed pretest/posttest program evaluation study of the Marine Corp's NLMB program, which took place over 6 months in 2009 (April-October). The three highest perceptions of barriers to care reported by NCOs for their Marines were related to being embarrassed, having members of one's unit have less confidence in the Marine, and concerns about being treated differently by military unit leadership. Three principal components for PBTC were identified, accounting for approximately 59% of the total variance. Higher education and prior exposure to suicide within one's military unit significantly correlated with greater perceived barriers to care; sex was not significantly correlated with greater perceived barriers to care. Implications of these findings, in relation to future research, are further discussed.

AB Objective: Rates of major depression and suicide vary across ethnic groups within the US. This also may be true of suicide attempts.
   Method: Data on lifetime suicidal behavior and major depression among Mexican American, Cuban American, and Puerto Rican adults who participated in the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Epidemiologic Survey were pooled with Epidemiological Catchment Area Study data for Blacks, Whites and Hispanics.
   Results: Rates of major depression ranged from 9.3 (Puerto Ricans) to 3.24% (Cuban Americans). Puerto Ricans and whites had the highest rates of depression. Similarly, suicide attempt rates ranged from 9.1% for Puerto Ricans to 1.9% for Cuban Americans. Puerto Ricans had higher suicide attempt rates compared with other groups.
   Conclusion: This study underscores that there are differences between Hispanic ethnic groups. The impact of the migration process, socioeconomic status, and acculturation may underlie differences in major depression and suicide attempt rates across ethnic groups.

AB Studies have yielded consistent variables associated with military suicides: age (17 to 30 years), gender (male), race (white), and previous mental health conditions. Military experience variables have shown little associations with suicide. Taken together, findings may be explained, in part, by age-specific psychosocial tasks (e. g., intimacy versus isolation and identity versus role confusion). Both relate directly to the extent that the individual is socially integrated-tasks health and medical research literature have described as increasingly more difficult for youth to effectively accomplish. Contextual circumstances, such as gender and race, appear to provide necessary supports to successfully accomplish these psychosocial tasks.

AB Objective: Updated and regional data about the circumstances of death and the psychosocial backgrounds of suicides can be helpful for improving suicide-preventive strategies in childhood and adolescence. Method: All known cases of completed suicide in the period from 1996 to 2008 in persons <= 21 years of age from the Institute of Forensic Medicine, Frankfurt/Main were analysed in a retrospective study. We included 78 cases and matched them with a comparative sample of 1,797 adult suicides of persons > 21 years of age. Results: Within the chosen period there was a 44 % decrease in incidence of suicide in the group of <= 21-year-olds. The fraction of incarcerated persons in this group was 8.0 % compared to 2.56 % in the adult group. Differences from suicide in adulthood were also demonstrated in terms cif suicide-related substance abuse (less detection of alcohol, more frequent detection of illicit drugs) and choice of methods (more deaths by being hit by a train). Conclusions: Incarcerated adolescents are an important risk group for suicidal tendency and need increased, well-directed preventive measures. Clinical adolescent psychiatry should pay special attention to the indications in this study of an age-dependent association of drug use in suicide.

AB Chronic illness is an important risk factor for suicidal behavior. Obesity is perhaps the most prevalent chronic disease at present, although the contribution of obesity to fatal and nonfatal suicide is controversial. Several large population-based studies have shown that obesity is independently linked to an increased risk of suicide. However, this association has been challenged by reports demonstrating a paradoxical relationship between an increasing body mass index and suicide. Recently, it has also been suggested that bariatric surgery patients are at increased risk of death by suicide postoperatively. We reviewed the heterogeneous data concerning the relationship between obesity and suicide. We also critically examined recent reports describing the incidence of fatal suicide events after bariatric surgery. From the present review, it appears that a positive association between obesity and suicide has been observed more frequently than a negative or absent association. This implies that obese individuals are indeed at an increased risk of suicide. This risk seems to persist despite treatment of obesity with bariatric surgery. (Surg Obes Relat Dis 2012;8:98-107.)

AB Background: US suicide rates correlate with firearm availability. Little is known about variability in rates across countries. Aims: To observe the relationship between firearm/overall suicide rates in Toronto, Canada, and the five most populous US metropolitan areas. Method: Centers for Disease Control suicide rates by age and sex for New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, and Houston metropolitan areas were compared with equivalent data for Toronto (1999-2015). Results: Suicide rates by firearm, per 100,000 population, ranged from 0.45 in Toronto to 6.03 in Houston while rates by other methods ranged from 4.34 in Dallas-Fort Worth to 7.11 in Toronto. Overall rates of suicide ranged from 6.14 in New York to 10.45 in Houston. The two cities with the highest firearm suicide rates, Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston, also had much higher overall rates. Firearm suicides were most common in men over the age of 65 in all cities. Limitations: This study could not account for cultural differences between cities/countries. Conclusion: Much higher overall rates of suicide observed for Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston appear to be associated with high rates of suicide by firearm. Advocacy for means safety should target cities with high rates of firearm suicide and, in particular, elderly men.

AB Objectives. We examined the associations of overall and age-specific suicide rates with business cycles from 1928 to 2007 in the United States.
   Methods. We conducted a graphical analysis of changes in suicide rates during business cycles, used nonparametric analyses to test associations between business cycles and suicide rates, and calculated correlations between the national unemployment rate and suicide rates.
   Results. Graphical analyses showed that the overall suicide rate generally rose during recessions and fell during expansions. Age-specific suicide rates responded differently to recessions and expansions. Nonparametric tests indicated that the overall suicide rate and the suicide rates of the groups aged 25 to 34 years, 35 to 44 years, 45 to 54 years, and 55 to 64 years rose during contractions and fell during expansions. Suicide rates of the groups aged 15 to 24 years, 65 to 74 years, and 75 years and older did not exhibit this behavior. Correlation results were concordant with all nonparametric results except for the group aged 65 to 74 years.
   Conclusions. Business cycles may affect suicide rates, although different age groups responded differently. Our findings suggest that public health responses are a necessary component of suicide prevention during recessions. (Am J Public Health. 2011;101:1139-1146. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2010.300010)

AB Many studies have reported higher rates of suicide attempts among sexual minority individuals compared with their heterosexual counterparts. For suicides, however, it has been argued that there is no sexual orientation risk difference, based on the results of psychological autopsy studies. The purpose of this article was to clarify the reasons for the seemingly discrepant findings for suicide attempts and suicides. First, we reviewed studies that investigated if the increased suicide attempt risk of sexual minorities resulted from biased self-reports or less rigorous assessments of suicide attempts. Second, we reanalyzed the only two available case-control autopsy studies and challenge their original "no difference" conclusion by pointing out problems with the interpretation of significance tests and by applying Bayesian statistics and meta-analytical procedures. Third, we reviewed register based and clinical studies on the association of suicides and sexual orientation. We conclude that studies of both suicide attempts and suicides do, in fact, point to an increased suicide risk among sexual minorities, thus solving the discrepancy. We also discuss methodological challenges inherent in research on sexual minorities and potential ethical issues. The arguments in this article are necessary to judge the weight of the evidence and how the evidence might be translated into practice.

   STORAGE; RISK
AB Purpose of review
   Suicide is an important global public health problem. Across nations, suicide rates are linked to the availability of lethal means. Three methods dominate country-specific suicide rates: firearms, pesticides, and hanging. There is increasing international support for reducing the availability of lethal means to prevent suicide. This article reviews evidence regarding lethal means reduction as a suicide-prevention strategy.
   Recent findings
   Most evidence in support of means reduction comes from ecological studies examining the association between population-level decreases in the availability of a given lethal means of suicide and method-specific suicide rates. Substantial declines in method-specific suicide rates were shown following reductions in availability of lethal means through initiatives such as the passage of firearm control laws, detoxification of domestic gas, modification of drug packaging and toxicity, and installation of barriers at jump sites. The vast majority of the evidence for the effectiveness of lethal means reduction relates to reducing the availability of firearms and pesticides.
   Summary
   Implementing means reduction at both the population and individual levels poses many challenges, particularly when political issues arise during regulation of firearms or pesticides. Nevertheless, evidence strongly suggests that means reduction is effective and should be an important part of a suicide-prevention strategy.

AB The British novelist Nicky Singer talks about becoming a writer, the role of editors and about who decides what can-and what can't-be published either side of the Atlantic. Her three novels explore territory which can make publishers nervous: Feather Boy (initiation rites and domestic violence), Doll (self-harm) and The Innocent's Story (terrorist suicide bombing). The sharply contrasting responses from publishers in the United Kingdom and the United States are described. Through Nicky Singer's sometimes extraordinary experiences with publishers runs the implicit question, perhaps as important now as it has ever been: What constraints should there be on what is explored in books for young readers?

AB Joiner's (2005) theory attributes suicide to an individual's acquired capability to enact self-harm, perceived burdensomeness, and thwarted belongingness. This study evaluated whether Joiner's theory could differentiate United States (US) Air Force (AF) personnel (n = 60) who died by suicide from a living active duty AF personnel comparison sample (n = 122). Responses from AF personnel on several scales assessing Joiner's constructs were compared to data from a random sample of postmortem investigatory files of AF personnel who died by suicide between 1996-2006. This research also introduced a newly designed measure, the Interpersonal-Psychological Survey (IPS), designed to assess the three components of Joiner's theory in one, easy-to-administer instrument. Analyses of the psychometric properties of the IPS support initial validation efforts to establish this scale as a predictive measure for suicide. Findings support that one's score on the Acquired Capability to Commit Suicide subscale of the IPS and the IPS overall score reliably distinguished between the two groups. The implications of these findings in relation to suicide prevention efforts in the US military are discussed.

AB Objective: Late-life suicide is a complex clinical and public health problem. Method: In this article, some of the key complexities inherent in studying late-life suicide are discussed in the service of promoting high-quality late-life suicide prevention science. Results: We discuss the following research issues: the relatively greater lethality of suicidal behavior in later life (compared to younger ages); the lack of data on whether thoughts of death in later life are indicators of suicide risk; the fact that older adults do not tend to seek specialty mental health care, necessitating moving research into primary care clinics and the community; the lack of theory-based research in late-life suicide; the unclear role of cognitive impairment; and the promise of taking a patient centered' and participatory research' approach to late-life suicide research efforts. Conclusion: We believe that these perspectives are too often not capitalized upon in research on suicide prevention with older adults and that voice of the older person could contribute much to our understanding of why older adults think about and act on suicidal thoughts, as well as the most acceptable ways to reach and intervene with those at risk.

AB Objective: Males are more likely than females to die by all forms of violent death, including suicide. The primary purpose of the present study was to explore whether the gender difference in suicide rates is largely accounted for by males' general greater tendency to experience violent deaths. The current study examined gender and age differences in suicides and other violent deaths, using data from a population-based surveillance system.
   Method: Pearson's chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses were conducted with data for 32,107 decedents in the 2003-2005 National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). Decedents were categorized by gender, age, and death by suicide versus other violent means.
   Results: When suicides were examined in the greater context of violent death, the total proportion of violent deaths due to suicide did not differ across gender. When deaths were examined by age group, after controlling for ethnicity, marital status, and U.S. location in which the death occurred, males in early to mid childhood were significantly more likely than same-aged females to die by suicide relative to all other violent deaths. The portion of deaths due to suicide was for the most part equal across both genders in late childhood, young adulthood, and mid-adulthood. Older males were more likely than older females to die by suicide relative to other violent deaths.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that that the risk of dying by suicide relative to other violent deaths may be more pronounced at certain developmental stages for each gender. This knowledge may be valuable in tailoring prevention strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Few studies have examined long-term suicide risk among breast cancer survivors, and there are no data for women in the United States. We quantified suicide risk through 2002 among 723 810 I-year breast cancer survivors diagnosed between January 1, 1953, and December 31, 2001, and reported to 16 population-based cancer registries in the United States and Scandinavia. Among breast cancer survivors, we calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and excess absolute risks (EARs) compared with the general population, and the probability of suicide. We used Poisson regression likelihood ratio tests to assess heterogeneity in SMRs; all statistical tests were two-sided, with a .05 cutoff for statistical significance. In total 836 breast cancer patients committed suicide (SMR = 1.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.28 to 1.47; EAR = 4.1 per 100000 person-years). Although SMRs ranged from 1.25 to 1.53 among registries, with 245 deaths among the sample of US women (SMR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.32 to 1.70), differences among registries were not statistically significant (P for heterogeneity = .19). Risk was elevated throughout follow-up, including for 25 or more years after diagnosis (SMR = 1.35, 95% Cl = 0.82 to 2.12), and was highest among black women (SMR = 2.88, 95% CI = 1.44 to 5.17) (P for heterogeneity = .06). Risk increased with increasing stage of breast cancer (P for heterogeneity = .08) and remained elevated among women diagnosed between 1990 and 2001 (SMR = 1.36, 95% Cl = 1.18 to 1.57). The cumulative probability of suicide was 0.20% 30 years after breast cancer diagnosis.

AB Information on the association of impulsivity and measures of aggression with suicidal ideation in adolescents and young adults is limited. Data were gathered from a community sample of 62 5 adolescent and young adult males. Analyses were based on multivariate generalized estimating equations. Impulsivity and irritability were associated strongly with suicidal ideation after accounting for alcohol dependence and other aggression-related constructs including psychopathy. Given that irritable, impulsive adolescent males appear to contemplate suicidal behavior, their heightened suicide risk may be anticipated and mitigated.

AB Firearms account for approximately half of all US suicide deaths each year despite being utilized in only a small minority of suicide attempts. We examined the extent to which overall suicide rates fluctuated relative to firearm and non-firearm suicide rates across a period of 16 years (1999-2015). We further tested the notion of means substitution by examining the association between firearm suicide rates and non-firearm suicide rates. Lastly, we examined the extent to which the presence of specific laws related to handgun ownership previously shown cross-sectionally to be associated with lower suicide rates (universal background checks, mandatory waiting periods) were associated with an attenuated trajectory in suicide rates across the study period. As anticipated, whereas decreases in firearm suicide rates were associated with decreases in overall suicide rates (b = 0.46, SE = 0.07, p b 0.001), decreases in firearm suicides were not associated with off-setting increases in suicides by other methods (b=-0.04, SE= 0.05, p= 0.36). Furthermore, the absence of universal background check (b = 0.12, SE= 0.05, p = 0.028) and mandatory waiting period (b= 0.16, SE= 0.06, p = 0.008) laws was associated with a more steeply rising trajectory of statewide suicide rates. These results mitigate concerns regarding means substitution and speak to the potential high yield impact of systematically implemented means safety prevention efforts focused on firearms.

AB Expert opinion is divided about whether US military veterans, the vast majority of whom are middle-aged or older, are at increased risk of suicide. To assess the risk of suicide associated with veteran status, the authors conducted a prospective cohort study of 499,356 male participants in the Cancer Prevention Study II. Participants reported their veteran status and other characteristics in 1982 and were followed for mortality through 2004. The relative risk of mortality from suicide according to veteran status at baseline was estimated by using Cox proportional hazards models. During follow-up, 1,248 veterans and 614 nonveterans died by suicide. In age-adjusted analyses, the risk of suicide did not differ by veteran status. Additional adjustment for several sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical factors had little effect on hazard ratios. The authors concluded that the risk of death from suicide among middle-aged and older US males is independent of veteran status and suggest that policies to prevent veteran suicide should focus on factors that may heighten suicide risk rather than on veteran status per se.

AB Suicide has been reported as the second or third most common cause of death in children and adolescents all over the world. The aim of the study was to investigate the general properties of suicide in childhood and adolescents, and to evaluate the results in the light of literature. Reports of autopsies performed between 2001 and 2005 in the Morgue Department of the Council of Forensic Medicine in Istanbul (n=16853) were examined retrospectively. Deaths between 0-18 years of age doubtlessly considered as suicide were included in the study. Childhood and adolescent (0-18 years) deaths comprised 10.4% (n=1761) of all medico-legal autopsy cases. 136 cases of suicidal origin were evaluated in terms of age, gender, and method of suicide. The ages ranged between 7 and 18, with a mean of 15.54 +/- 2.691(SD). The most common method of suicide was hanging (59.2%) in both genders. Older adolescents (16-18 age group) constituted the overwhelming number (63.2%, n=86) of all cases. Seven cases of 10 years of age and below were determined, and hanging was the method of suicide in five of these cases. In order to prevent childhood suicides, families and society should be aware of their responsibilities.

AB BACKGROUND: Australia is one of the world's foremost mining nations. Over the past decade, the number of resources sector employees has risen steadily. It is increasingly suggested in lay press and popular discourse that mining industry employees (the majority of whom are men) face an elevated risk of suicide relative to the general population, and that suicide rates are higher among mining industry employees relative to other occupations. However, there has been no empirical evaluation of this proposal, which impedes the ability to develop appropriate policy responses.
   OBJECTIVE: This study begins to fill knowledge gaps, by providing the first quantitative examination of suicide rates in the mining industry. METHODS: Data from the Queensland Suicide Register were used to examine suicide rates in the resources sector, relative to other sectors.
   RESULTS: The mining industry was found to have lower male suicide rates relative to other occupations and the working-age male population overall.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings do not support the view that mining industry employment is necessarily associated with elevated suicide rates. Many factors, ranging from individual personality characteristics through to workplace policies, may contribute to this observation.

AB Objective: Homicide - suicides are rare relative to suicides and homicides, but these lethal events are an emerging public health concern. They have a mortality count similar to meningitis, pulmonary tuberculosis, influenza, and viral hepatitis, and the rate may be increasing in the United States, especially among older persons. The goal of this case - control study was to identify factors that differentiate older married men who commit homicide - suicide from those who commit suicide only. Methods: A total of 20 spousal homicide - suicides involving persons age 55 years and older were ascertained in Florida between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 1999 from medical examiner records. Two suicide controls were matched to each homicide - suicide perpetrator by age, race, marital status, method of death, and medical examiner district. Perpetrator groups were compared on sociodemographic characteristics, medical variables, and autopsy findings. Results: Homicide - suicide perpetrators displayed significantly more domestic violence or were caregivers for their wives, in contrast to suicide perpetrators, who had health problems and were receiving care from their spouses. Both groups of perpetrators had reported depressed mood, and there were no differences in sociodemographic factors. Conclusions: Depression plays a significant role in both homicide - suicide and suicide, but the associated factors are different: we see caregiving strain in perpetrators of homicide - suicide, and living with physical health disorders as a care-recipient in men who commit suicide. Marital conflict is a significant factor in some spousal homicide - suicides.

AB Objective(s). To characterize the suicide rates among patients with gynecologic cancer in the Unites States and to identify factors associated with high suicide rates.
   Method(s). Subjects with a diagnosis of gynecologic cancer were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program for the period 1988-2007. Comparison with women in the general US population was based on WHO data 2005, matched for age in 10-year categories. Cox regression models were used to perform multivariate modeling for factors associated with suicide.
   Result(s). Among 252,235 patients followed for 1,207,278 person-years, the suicide rate was 8.3 per 100,000 person-years, with a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of 1.4 (95% CI 1.2-1.7, p<0.001). The highest suicide rates were observed in patients with ovarian cancer and within the first year following diagnosis. Suicide risk was associated with younger age at diagnosis, high grade disease and absence of surgical intervention.
   Conclusion(s). Patients with gynecologic cancer have an increased suicide risk when compared to the general population. Suicide rates vary by cancer site and time since diagnosis. Effective screening and appropriate treatment of psychosocial stress among women with gynecologic cancer are warranted. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper examines the suicide rates of 23 cities and counties in Taiwan from 1983 to 2001. We found that a combination of economic and social variables can significantly account for the tremendous variations in suicide rates across Taiwan's cities and counties over the last two decades. The level of income per capita in a region appears as the most important predictor of suicide rates. However, some sociological correlates (such as divorce rate) which were less powerful in explaining suicide rate variations in the earlier study appear to exert more significant influence over suicide rates when eight more recent years of information are added, as in the current study. This study also uncovered several gender differences in the determination of regional suicide rates, such as the proportion of elderly population in the region, and the impacts of earthquake and unemployment. Furthermore, this study confirmed the linkages between natural disaster (earthquake) and suicide, between economic and social miseries (unemployment and divorce, respectively) and suicide, as well as those between demographics (aboriginal and elderly sub-population groups) and suicide. This may help to identify high-risk groups or areas where suicide prevention and intervention efforts should be concentrated on or directed to. Lastly, the local suicide crisis-intervention agencies are found to be significantly effective in reducing suicide rates of the community they serve.

AB The objective of this study was to identify the impact of a patient's suicide on psychiatrists in Thailand. A confidential coded postal questionnaire survey was sent to 320 eligible psychiatrists; with a response rate of 52.18%). The results showed that 94 (56.28%) of responding psychiatrists had a patient die by suicide, consistent with high rates found in similar large-scale studies in the United States and United Kingdom. Less than half (41.5%) of patients had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, 33% had a depressive disorder, and the others had a wide array of diagnoses. More than 50% of psychiatrists reported personally experiencing sadness, depression, hopelessness, and guilt; 74.5% reported professional reactions, most frequently a review of their practice (93.4% reported being more aggressive in assessment of suicidality). Respondents were diverse in their postvention; 90% of Thai psychiatrists reported that working through with colleagues was most helpful. Family and friends helped. A majority (72.4%) of psychiatrists prayed or did "merit" for the dead patient; 86.8% found it helpful. This finding suggests that cultural sensitivity may be needed to understand the impact of suicide on psychiatrists but also to its response.

Etiologic research elucidates warrior culture and subculture as contributing factors of this pathology. This paper examines the idiosyncratic nature and influence of warrior culture and subculture and offers recommendations to promote culture change. Faith-based spirituality and prayer are examined as adjunct modalities for stress management and emotional healing. Further research is recommended to assess the associated hidden cost factors and long-term financial impact of warrior culture on society.

AB An emerging problem that health professionals face in working with terminally ill patients is how to respond to the concerns and conflicts that emerge near the end of life. Most important are those that challenge the traditional healing, caring, and therapeutic roles. Among these, perhaps none has drawn as much attention as the issue of physician-assisted dying-particularly what has been termed assisted suicide. Although the ethics of assisted dying have been actively debated by ethicists for decades, the topic is now being discussed with increasing frequency in medical, psychiatric, psychological, and legal journals. Interest has been driven by the interrelationship of changing public opinion, demographics, and the nature of the dying process; admissions of assistance by numerous physicians; and several statewide attempts at legal change, culminating in a successful voters' initiative in Oregon.

AB Objective. The literature on the possible impact of publicized suicide stories on suicide in the real world has been marked by considerable debate and inconsistent findings. Methods. The present study analyzes 293 findings from forty-two studies on the subject which were published between 1974 and 1996. Results. A logistic regression analysis determined that characteristics of the stories were key predictors of finding a copycat effect. Studies measuring the presence of either an entertainment or political celebrity suicide were 14.3 times more likely to find a copycat effect than studies that did not. Studies based on real stories as opposed to fictional stories were 4.03 times more apt to uncover an imitation effect. The medium of coverage was a significant predictor of copycat effects with televised stories being 82 percent less likely to affect suicide than newspaper-based stories. Some evidence was found for period effects, and stories were linked more often to the incidence of suicide attempts than suicide completions. The model correctly classified 79 percent of the 293 findings. Conclusions. Methodological differences among studies are strong predictors of differences in their findings..

TI Predictors of Emerging Suicide Death Among Military Personnel on Social

AB Suicide is a leading cause of death in the United States and is the second leading cause of death in the U.S. military. Previous research suggests that data obtained from social media networks may provide important clues for identifying at-risk individuals. To test this possibility, the social media profiles from 315 military personnel who died by suicide (n=157) or other causes (n=158) were coded for the presence of stressful life situations (i.e., triggers), somatic complaints or health issues (i.e., physical), maladaptive or avoidant coping strategies (i.e., behaviors), negative mood states (i.e., emotion), and/or negative cognitive appraisals (cognition). Content codes were subsequently analyzed using multilevel models from a dynamical systems perspective to identify temporal change processes characteristic of suicide death. Results identified temporal sequences unique to suicide, notably social media posts about triggers followed by more posts about cognitions, posts about cognitions followed by more posts about triggers, and posts about behaviors followed by fewer posts about cognitions. Results suggest that certain sequences in social media content may predict cause of death and provide an estimate of when a social media user is likely to die by suicide.

AB Background: Studies on attitudes toward suicide are of great interest to researchers worldwide. Although various instruments have been developed to measure attitudes toward suicide, psychometric properties of these instruments have not been systematically reviewed and organized.
   Aim: We aimed to identify valid, reliable and feasible attitudinal scales by systematically reviewing published articles on scale development and validation studies. In particular, this study focused on scales used for a wide range of populations to measure multidimensional attitudes toward suicide and related issues.
   Methods: Electronic searches of two databases, PubMed and PsychInfo, were performed. Scales with unique names were identified and listed after reviewing selected publications, and then evaluated for psychometric properties, multidimensionality and appropriateness for a wide range of populations.
   Results: A total of 2,210 publications were identified by the first electronic search. In the final review process of the selected publications, three scales - the Suicide Opinion Questionnaire (SOQ), Suicide Attitude Questionnaire (SUIATT) and Attitudes Toward Suicide (ATTS) - were identified.
   Conclusion: Each of these scales has its own characteristics and should be used in accordance with research purposes.

ID UNITED-STATES; HEALTH; DISEASES; IDEATION
AB Background: Patients diagnosed with skin conditions have a higher risk of comorbid psychiatric conditions and suicide-related outcomes such as suicidal ideations and behaviors. There is paucity of evidence in the US general population about the risk of suicide death in patients with dermatologic conditions. Methods: We conducted a retrospective case-control study to investigate the risk of suicide death in patients receiving care for dermatologic conditions. This study involved 8 US health systems. A total of 2674 individuals who died by suicide (cases) were matched with 267,400 general population control individuals. Results: After adjusting for age, sex, and any mental health or substance use condition, we did not find an association between death by suicide and any skin condition including conditions where clinicians are generally concerned about the risk such as acne (adjusted odds ratio [alpha OR] = 1.04, p = 0.814), atopic dermatitis (aOR = 0.77, p = 0.28), and psoriasis (aOR = 0.91, p = 0.64). Conclusion: This case-control study provides no evidence of increased risk of death by suicide in individuals with major skin disorders in the US general population.

AB Background: Suicide rates in China are among the highest in the world, although there has been a decreasing trend in the past few years. One practical approach to study this characteristics and risk factors of suicide is to interview the suicide attempters. It was to compare completed suicides with serious attempters that may shed lights on suicide prevention strategies.
   Method: This is a combination of two case control studies for suicide completers and suicide attempters respectively. After a sample of suicides (n=392) and community living controls (n=416) were obtained and studied in rural China, we collected in the same rural areas data of suicide attempt and studied 507 medically serious attempters and 503 community counterparts.
   Results: Characteristics and previously observed risk factors were compared between the suicides and the attempters, and we found that the demographic characteristics and risk factors for the suicides were also for the medically serious attempters but at some lesser degrees for the attempters than for the suicides. It was especially true of suicide intent, deficient coping, negative life events, and impulsivity. While most of the demographic characteristics were not significantly different between the suicides and the attempters, most of the clinical variables could distinguish the two groups.
   Conclusions: The suicide victims and the serious attempters could be of the same group of people who were at the edge of fatal self-injury, and the same clinical risk factors but of different degrees have divided them into the life and death groups. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved

   IDEATION; DEPRESSION; PARASUICIDE; PREVALENCE; BEHAVIOR; EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Background. Few studies have focused on factors that uniquely distinguish suicide attempters from suicide ideators. This study assesses prevalence of suicide attempts among suicide ideators within a community sample; explores demographics, employment status, mental and physical health conditions, personality, life stresses and social environment as factors that may distinguish these groups; examines effects of age and gender upon suicide attempts and associated factors; and investigates the increase in suicide attempts when multiple factors related to this behaviour are present.
   Method. Data were drawn from the PATH Through Life Project, a community survey of 7485 people in Canberra, Australia. A subsample of 522 suicide ideators were used for this study.
   Results. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with suicide attempts. Physical medical conditions (OR 1.95) and negative interactions with friends (OR 1.20) were associated with an increased likelihood of suicide attempts among suicide ideators. Age and gender interaction effects for suicide attempts were found involving physical medical condition and mastery among men (OR 3.78 and 0.83 respectively) and not being employed for those aged 40-44 years (OR 8.94). A cumulative effect was found when multiple factors associated with suicide attempts were present, and the probability of an attempt was significantly elevated.
   Conclusions. Factors distinguishing those who attempt suicide from suicide ideators involve being unemployed, physical ill health and relationship difficulties. Contrary to expectation, this study found that ideators and attempters experience comparable levels of depression and anxiety.

   END; PRACTITIONERS; LEGALIZATION; RESPONSES
AB Context: The topic of physician-assisted suicide is difficult and controversial. With recent laws allowing physicians to assist in a terminally ill patient's suicide under certain circumstances, the debate concerning the appropriate and ethical role for physicians has intensified. Purpose: This paper utilizes data from a 1997 survey of family physicians (FPs) in Washington State to test two hypotheses: (1) older respondents will indicate greater opposition to physician-assisted suicide than their younger colleagues, and (2) male and rural physicians will have more negative attitudes toward physician-assisted suicide than their female and urban counterparts. Methods: A questionnaire administered to all active FPs obtained a 68% response rate, with 1074 respondents found to be eligible in this study. A ZIP code system based on generalist Health Service Areas was used to designate those practicing in rural versus urban areas. Findings: One-fourth of the respondents overall indicated support for physician-assisted suicide. Men asked whether this practice should be legalized, 39% said yes, 44% said no, and 18% indicated that they did not know. Fifty-eight percent of the study sample reported that they would not include physician-assisted suicide in their practices even if it were legal. Responses disaggregated by age-groups closely paralleled the group overall. There was a significant pattern of opposition on the part of rural male respondents compared to urban female respondents. Even among those reporting support for physician-assisted suicide, many expressed reluctance about including it in their practices. Conclusions: These findings highlight the systematic differences in FP attitudes toward one aspect of health care by gender, rural-urban practice location, and other factors.

AB Youth transitioning to adulthood have unique developmental tasks that make them vulnerable to suicide. Brain development, life stressors, and psychological adjustments during the transition contribute to a high rate of suicidal gestures. To reduce the incidence of self-harm in this age group, a public health approach that identifies and reduces risk factors and enhances protective factors should be used. Institutions and employment arenas should consider structural supports to facilitate this transition of youth into adulthood, with a particular focus on youth with self-harm thoughts, and should provide education about suicide, evidence-based resources, and intervention programs to encourage help seeking.

AB Suicide and major depressive disorder (MDD) are complex conditions that almost certainly arise from the influences of many interrelated factors. There are significant regional variations in the rates of MDD and suicide in the United States, suggesting that sociodemographic and environmental conditions contribute. Here, we review epidemiological evidence that increases in the altitude of residence are linked to the increased risk of depression and suicide. We consider the possibility that chronic hypobaric hypoxia (low blood oxygen related to low atmospheric pressure) contributes to suicide and depression, which is suggested by animal models, short-term studies in humans, and the effects of hypoxic medical conditions on suicide and depression. We argue that hypobaric hypoxia could promote suicide and depression by altering serotonin metabolism and brain bioenergetics; both of these pathways are implicated in depression, and both are affected by hypoxia. Finally, we briefly examine treatment strategies to address hypoxia-related depression and suicidal ideation that are suggested by these findings, including creatine monohydrate and the serotonin precursors tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptophan.

DE advance directives; end-of-life decisions; health care; palliative care;
   physician-assisted suicide; U. S. Supreme Court rulings
AB In the United States, judicial rulings that unrealistically addressed the complexity of cases and demonstrated limited understanding of principles, helped to create a legal quagmire which legislatures had to confront. Moreover, the legislative response was often slow and inadequate in terms of both the scope and clarity of the laws. However, since the 1970s, progress has been made on many fronts, particularly in regard to advance directives dealing with end-of-life decisions. The debate over physician-assisted suicide has spawned a repetition of moral and legal arguments. Those against legalization have failed to make a realistic appraisal of the dilemmas facing patients and their families in an age of technological medicine delivered in the context of the marketplace. The underlying problem is a system in dire need of reform that will no longer treat health care as a commodity of the marketplace and provide universal health care. Terminal care as an integral part of health care will substantially benefit from such reforms because a major obstacle to comprehensive palliative care is the condition of the present system.

AB Background: There are only a few recent studies on secular trends in child and adolescent suicides. We examine here trends in rates and methods of suicide among young people in Finland, where suicide rates at these ages are among the highest in the world. Methods: The data, obtained from Statistics Finland, consisted of all suicides (n = 901) committed by persons under 18 years of age over the period 1969-2008. Gender-specific trends were analysed separately for the years 1969-1989 and 1990-2008 using 3-year moving averages. Trends in methods of suicide were examined from 1975 to 2008 in five-year periods. Results: The male-to-female ratio in youth suicides was 3.6:1. The male rates increased in 1969-1989, while the rates among females were inconsistent. After 1990, the rates decreased for males but turned to an increase among females. Shooting was the most common suicide method among males throughout the period, while hanging exceeded poisoning as the most common method among females after 1990. All violent suicides decreased for males and increased for females in 1990-2008. Conclusions: The increase in violent, i.e., more lethal, suicide methods among young females is alarming, as females are known to have higher rates of attempted suicide than males. Alcohol consumption, rates and treatment of depression and violent behaviour among adolescents are discussed as approaches towards explaining this phenomenon.

AB Completed suicide and nonfatal suicide-related outcomes (SROs), such as suicidal ideation and attempts, are heritable. A recent genetic association study in a sample of suicide victims reported a protective effect of the G allele of Asn40Asp (rs1799971) on risk for completed suicide. We examined the association of three OPRM1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs1799971, rs609148, and rs648893) with SRO in 426 European Americans, using GEE logistic regression analysis to examine the association of a lifetime history of SRO. There was no allelic association with the SRO phenotypes. A larger sample may be needed to identify risk variants that convey SRO risk. OPRM1 may not be important in the risk of SRO.

   multilevel National Violent Death Reporting System analysis
SO PLOS ONE

AB Objective Higher prevalence of suicide notes could signify more conservatism in accounting and greater proneness to undercounting of suicide by method. We tested two hypotheses: (1) an evidentiary suicide note is more likely to accompany suicides by drug-intoxication and by other poisoning, as less violent and less forensically overt methods, than suicides by firearm and hanging/suffocation; and (2) performance of a forensic autopsy attenuates any observed association between overtness of method and the reported presence of a note.
   Methods This multilevel (individual/county), multivariable analysis employed a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). Representing the 17 states participating in the United States National Violent Death Reporting System throughout 2011-2013, the study population comprised registered suicides, aged 15 years and older. Decedents totaled 32,151. The outcome measure was relative odds of an authenticated suicide note.
   Results An authenticated suicide note was documented in 31% of the suicide cases. Inspection of the full multivariable model showed a suicide note was more likely to manifest among drug intoxication (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.70; 95% CI, 1.56, 1.85) and other poisoning suicides (OR, 2.12; 1.85, 2.42) than firearm suicides, the referent. Respective excesses were larger when there was no autopsy or autopsy status was unknown (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.61, 2.14) and (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.86, 2.72) relative to the comparisons with a forensic autopsy (OR, 1.62, 95% CI, 1.45, 1.82 and OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.66, 2.43). Hanging/suffocation suicides did not differ from the firearm referent given an autopsy.
   Conclusions Suicide requires substantial affirmative evidence to establish manner of death, and affirmation of drug intoxication suicides appears to demand an especially high burden of proof. Findings and their implications argue for more stringent investigative standards, better training, and more resources to support comprehensive and accurate case ascertainment, as the foundation for developing evidence-based suicide prevention initiatives.

ID UNITED-STATES; PHYSICIANS; CANCER; DEATH
AB A high suicide risk has been reported among veterinarians in comparison to the general population. Postulated causes have included depression, substance abuse, work-related stress, reluctance to admit psychiatric problems, and access to lethal drugs and/or familiarity with euthanasia. Members of the Student Chapter of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), all veterinarians licensed in Alabama, and all US veterinary-association executive directors were surveyed regarding their attitudes concerning mental health issues, including veterinarian suicide. Only 10% of veterinary student respondents (N = 58) believed that suicide risk is higher among veterinarians than in the general population. Of the 22 state associations executive directors who participated in the survey, 37% believed that suicide is a significant concern for veterinarians and only 44% indicated that a veterinary wellness program was available in their respective states. Of the 1,455 licensed veterinarians in Alabama, 701 responded to the survey; 11% of respondents believed that suicide among veterinarians was a problem. In addition, 66% of respondents indicated that they had been "clinically depressed," but 32% of those with depression had not sought treatment. More females (27%) than males (20%) admitted that they had "seriously considered suicide" (p < .01). Female veterinarians were more likely than male veterinarians (15% versus 7%) to indicate that they were "not sure they'd made the right career choice" (p < .001), and 4% of all respondents indicated "definitely not being happy with their career." It is of concern that veterinarians not only have a higher risk of suicide but that they also have fewer support structures. The wide discrepancies between the published risk of suicide for veterinarians and their own views of their risk suggests an inadequate awareness of their own mental health vulnerability which could put them at higher risk.

AB The military has a well-defined population with suicide prevention programs that have been recognized as possible models for civilian suicide prevention efforts. Monitoring prevention programs requires accurate reporting. In civilian settings, several studies have confirmed problems in the reporting and classification of suicides. This analysis evaluated whether suicides were underreported or misclassified under accident or undetermined manner of death in the military system. We reviewed all 1998 and 1999 military deaths using official death reports and compared these data with additional sources, most importantly the DoD Medical Mortality Registry. We assessed for evidence of expressed suicidal intent and past psychiatric history among deaths classified as undetermined and accidents due to gunshot, overdose, drowning, falls, or asphyxia. Using sources other than official records, we found 17% more suicides than were reported, and an additional 4% of deaths that were suspicious for suicide. This study suggests that reporting and classification errors may account for 21% additional suicides in the military. These findings are comparable to rates seen in civilian studies and add to the literature regarding the problems inherent in using administrative death classification data for medical Surveillance purposes.

AB Purpose: This study aims to examine how inequalities in suicide by education changed during and after macroeconomic restructuring following the economic crisis of 1997 in South Korea. Materials and Methods: Using Korea's 1995, 2000, and 2005 census data aggregately linked to mortality data (1993 - 2006), relative and absolute differentials in suicide mortality by education were calculated by gender and age among Korean population aged 35 and over. Results: Average annual suicide mortality rates have steadily increased from 1993 - 1997 to 2003 - 2006 in almost all sociodemographic groups stratified by gender, age, and education. Based on the relative index of inequality (RII) and slope index of inequality (SII), educational differentials in suicide mortality generally increased over time in men and women aged 45 years +. Although RII did not increase with year among men and women aged 35 - 44 years, SII showed a significantly increasing trend in this age group. Conclusion: These worsening absolute inequalities in suicide mortality indicate that the governmental suicide prevention policy should be directed toward socially disadvantaged groups of the Korean population.

AB The interpersonal-psychological theory of suicidal behavior (joiner, 2005) proposes that the need to belong is fundamental; when met it can prevent suicide and when thwarted it can substantially increase the risk for suicide. We investigate one source of group-wide variation in belongingness among college students-changes In the social composition of college campuses across academic semesters-as an explanation for variation in suicidal ideation across the academic year. Our results indicate that in a sample of college students at a large southern state university (n = 309), suicidal ideation varied across academic semesters, with highest levels in summer compared to both spring and fall. Differences in suicidal ideation between summer and spring were, in large part, accounted for by belongingness. Theoretical, as well as practical, implications are discussed regarding mechanisms for seasonal variation in suicidal ideation.

TI Bargaining in the shadow of the law: Divorce laws and family distress
SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

DT Article
AB This paper exploits the variation occurring from the different timing of divorce law reforms across the United States to evaluate how unilateral divorce changed family violence and whether the option provided by unilateral divorce reduced suicide and spousal homicide. Unilateral divorce both potentially increases the likelihood that a domestic violence relationship ends and acts to transfer bargaining power toward the abused, thereby potentially stopping the abuse in extant relationships. In states that introduced unilateral divorce we find a 8-16 percent decline in female suicide, roughly a 30 percent decline in domestic violence for both men and women, and a 10 percent decline in females murdered by their partners.

AB Validated measures that can be administered to school populations are needed to advance knowledge of help-seeking processes and to evaluate suicide prevention programs that target help-seeking. With 6,370 students from 22 high schools, we assessed the psychometric properties of three brief measures: Help-Seeking Acceptability at School, Adult Help for Suicidal Youth, and Reject Codes of Silence. Internal consistency coefficients ranged from .64 to .84. In support of construct validity, lower scores on each scale were associated with more maladaptive coping norms; for each one unit increase on each scale, students were one third to one half as likely to report suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and elevated depression.

ID REPORTING SYSTEM; CASE-CROSSOVER; STATES; INTOXICATION; METAANALYSIS;
   SAMPLE
AB This is a commentary on a meta-analysis in this journal by Anestis, Joiner, Hanson, and Gutierrez (2014) that analyzed 92 studies reporting data on the presence/absence of alcohol in suicide decedents based on positive blood alcohol concentrations (BACs). The authors conclude that the weighted mean percentage of suicide decedents with positive BACs is 26.9%, a result that is underestimated by 6.7% due to a coding error. The authors argue that acute use of alcohol may not be an important proximal risk factor for suicide based largely on the fact that it is not modal in decedents, a point that overlooks the fact that risk factors need not be modal to be of major public health significance. For example, most traffic fatalities do not involve a driver who had been drinking but this does not imply that alcohol use is unimportant in road deaths. Furthermore, the authors do not discuss controlled studies providing evidence that acute use of alcohol confers marked risk. The authors also predict that the percentage of suicide decedents with positive BACs who are intoxicated is low. However, published data on alcohol levels and suicide in the United States are available and show that most suicide decedents with positive blood tests have BACs at or above the U.S. legal limit of 0.08 g/dl for drinking and driving, with mean BACs well in excess of the legal limit, evidence of intoxication.

AB Minority sexual orientation has been repeatedly linked to elevated rates of suicide attempts. Whether this translates into greater risk for suicide mortality is unclear. We investigated sexual orientation-related differences in suicide mortality in Denmark during the initial 12-year period following legalization of same-sex registered domestic partnerships (RDPs).
   Using data from death certificates issued between 1990 and 2001 and population estimates from the Danish census, we estimated suicide mortality risk among individuals classified into one of three marital/cohabitation statuses: current/formerly in same-sex RDPs; current/formerly heterosexually married; or never married/registered.
   Risk for suicide mortality was associated with this proxy indicator of sexual orientation, but only significantly among men. The estimated age-adjusted suicide mortality risk for RDP men was nearly eight times greater than for men with positive histories of heterosexual marriage and nearly twice as high for men who had never married.
   Suicide risk appears greatly elevated for men in same-sex partnerships in Denmark. To what extent this is true for similar gay and bisexual men who are not in such relationships is unknown, but these findings call for targeted suicide prevention programs aimed at reducing suicide risk among gay and bisexual men.

AB Objectives. To characterize Firearm ownership and storage practices in Washington State and assess their relationship with suicide risk Factors.
   Methods, Using Washington State Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data For 2013 to 2016, we conducted survey-weighted multivariable Poisson regression models to obtain prevalence ratios (PRs) and confidence intervals (Cls).
   Results. OF 34 884 adult respondents, 34.3% (95% CI = 33.7%, 35.0%) reported a Firearm in their household, among whom 36.6% (95% CI = 35.4%, 377%) stored their Firearm locked and unloaded. There were no differences in mental health indicators by Firearm ownership or storage practice status. Binge and chronic alcohol use were somewhat more prevalent among adults From Firearm-owning households (PR = 1.2;95% CI = 1.1, 1.3; PR = 1.2; 95% CI = 1.1, 1.4, respectively) and among those living in households not practicing safe storage (PR= 1.4; 95% Cl = 12, 1.7; PR= 1.9; 1.5, 2.3, respectively).
   Conclusions. Variability in mental health does not explain the substantial increased suicide risk among individuals in firearm-owning households. Greater prevalence of alcohol misuse among adults in firearm-owning households not practicing safe storage highlights the need For suicide prevention interventions.

AB Death, like many social problems, has become medicalized. In response to this medicalization, physician-assisted suicide (PAS) has emerged as one alternative among many at the end of life. And although the practice is currently legal in the states of Oregon and Washington, opponents still argue that PAS is unethical, is inconsistent with a physician's role, and cannot be effectively regulated. In comparison, Switzerland, like Oregon, permits PAS, but unlike Oregon, non-physicians and private organizations play a significant role in assisted death. Could the Swiss model be the answer ? The following essay explores the Swiss model of assisted suicide for its potential to enhance the regulation of PAS, reduce physician involvement, and perhaps demedicalize the way we die.

TI The Pain Relief Promotion Act of 1999 - A serious threat to palliative
   care
SO JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
ID ASSISTED SUICIDE; SUPREME-COURT
AB Recent educational efforts in the US medical community have begun to address the critical issue bf palliative care for terminally ill patients. However, a newly introduced bill in; Congress, the Pain Relief Promotion Act of 1999 (PRPA), could dramatically hinder these efforts if enacted. The act criminally punishes the use of controlled substances to cause-or assist in causing-a patient's death. The primary purposes of PRPA are to override the physician-assisted suicide law currently in effect in Oregon and prohibit other states from enacting similar laws, The act also includes valuable provisions for better research and education in palliative care, but the benefits of those provisions are outweighed by the punitive sections of the act.
   Under PRPA, the quality of palliative care in the United States could be compromised when physicians, fearing criminal prosecution, err on the side of caution rather than risk their patients' deaths by using highly aggressive pain treatments. Furthermore,PRPA would put Drug Enforcement Administration officials, who have no medical expertise, in the position of regulating medical decisions. The act also would interfere with individual states' long-standing authority over medical practice. Finally, PRPA would discourage physicians from engaging in experimentation and innovation in palliative care, again out of concern for crossing the line between relief of suffering and physician-assisted suicide.
   Other bills have been introduced that go much further than PRPA to encourage palliative care, without its problematic provisions. Regardless of the controversy surrounding physician-assisted suicide in the United States, the need for quality end-of-life care will be far better sewed if Congress enacts one of these bills rather than PRPA.

AB Older persons in the United States are at higher risk for suicide than any other segment of the population. The epidemiology and risk factors for suicide in later life and the most promising approaches to its prevention are reviewed. Available data suggest that psychiatric and physical illnesses, functional impairment, personality traits of neuroticism and low openness to experience, and social isolation are important correlates of late-life suicide. Affective illness is the risk factor with the strongest association. As treatable conditions in most cases, mood disorders are critical targets for preventive interventions. Because 70% of older adults who committed suicide saw their primary care provider within 30 days of death, the primary care setting is an important venue for intervention. Mood disorders are common in primary care practice, but often go undiagnosed and inadequately treated. One important approach to late-life suicide prevention, therefore, is to optimize the ability of primary care providers to diagnose and treat late-life mood disorders and suicidality effectively. Other elders at high risk have no active relationship to primary care. Strategies designed to identify this group and provide them with preventive services through outreach to the community have shown promise as late-life suicide prevention measures as well.

AB Sexual minority populations are exposed to more forms of distress than heterosexual individuals, thereby increasing the risk of suicidal behavior. It therefore seems surprising that suicidal behavior in sexual minorities is not sufficiently addressed in the nursing literature.The aim of this review was to integrate evidence-based knowledge and experiences related to suicide in sexual minorities into the nursing literature. This study has been conducted according to PRISMA guidelines, which contains a basic systematic screening process. Fourteen articles met the research criteria. The evaluation encompassed 4 themes: 1) Suicide attempts; 2) Thoughts of suicide; 3) Suicide attempts and completed suicide; 4) Suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts. Most studies focused on the dimensions of attempted suicide. The key finding was that young people in sexual minority groups exhibit more suicidal ideation, more suicide attempts and are more at risk of completed suicide than heterosexual individuals. Family-centered care for young people can therefore be one of the basic principles of nursing practice. Nurses can routinely ask adolescents about their sexual orientation and identity to provide appropriate assessment and care. Additionally, nurses can use educational, counseling, case manager and therapist roles to avoid negative experiences such as homophobia, stigmatization and the discrimination of sexual minorities.

AB Objective: Data on risk factors for suicide in blacks in the United States are needed, given the dramatic increase in the black suicide rate from 1980 to 1997. The 1993 National Mortality Followback Survey represented an unprecedented opportunity to identify risk factors for suicide in blacks and to determine whether race differences (black versus white) in risk factors exist.
   Method: Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to compare cases of suicide (150 suicides in blacks and 1,279 Suicides in whites) with cases of accidental deaths (737 cases in blacks and 3,458 cases in whites). Predictors of interest were 18 items tapping four domains: antisocial behavior, substance use/abuse, depressive symptoms, and psychotic symptoms.
   Results: Four items distinguished suicides from accidental deaths in both black and whites: death ideation, suicidal ideation, bizarre behavior, and making violent threats. Items in two of the four domains discriminated risk for suicide in whites more strongly than in blacks: reports of community complaints and problem drinking. No variable conferred greater risk for suicide in blacks than in whites.
   Conclusions: The current study underscores the need for examination of race differences in risk factors for suicide. It is also essential to examine variables that were unavailable in the National Mortality Followback Survey data set, particularly racism, perceived discrimination, and feelings of alienation from the dominant culture.

AB Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 42,000 deaths in 2014. Although this tragedy cuts across groups defined by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and geographic location, it is striking that nearly four times as many males as females die by suicide in the U.S. We describe the current regulations and recommendations for suicide risk screening in healthcare systems and also describe the aspirational goal of "Zero Suicide," put forth by the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention. We then provide information about suicide risk screening tools and steps to take when a patient screens positive for suicide risk. Given the substantially higher suicide rate among males than females, we argue that it is important to consider how we could optimize suicide risk screening strategies to identify males at risk and females at risk. Further research is needed to accomplish this goal. It is recommended that we consider multi-factorial suicide risk screens that incorporate risk factors known to be particularly important for males as well as computerized, adaptive screens that are tailored for the specific risk considerations of the individual patient, male or female. These strategies are not mutually exclusive. Finally, universal suicide risk screening in healthcare settings, especially primary care, specialty medical care, and emergency department settings, is recommended.

AB Background: Restricting access to common means of suicide, such as firearms, toxic gas, pesticides and other, has been shown to be effective in reducing rates of death in suicide. In the present review we aimed to summarize the empirical and clinical literature on controlling the access to means of suicide. Methods: This review made use of both MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science and the Cochrane library databases, identifying all English articles with the keywords "suicide means", "suicide method", "suicide prediction" or "suicide prevention" and other relevant keywords. Results: A number of factors may influence an individual's decision regarding method in a suicide act, but there is substantial support that easy access influences the choice of method. In many countries, restrictions of access to common means of suicide has lead to lower overall suicide rates, particularly regarding suicide by firearms in USA, detoxification of domestic and motor vehicle gas in England and other countries, toxic pesticides in rural areas, barriers at jumping sites and hanging, by introducing "safe rooms" in prisons and hospitals. Moreover, decline in prescription of barbiturates and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), as well as limitation of drugs pack size for paracetamol and salicylate has reduced suicides by overdose, while increased prescription of SSRIs seems to have lowered suicidal rates. Conclusions: Restriction to means of suicide may be particularly effective in contexts where the method is popular, highly lethal, widely available, and/or not easily substituted by other similar methods. However, since there is some risk of means substitution, restriction of access should be implemented in conjunction with other suicide prevention strategies.

AB Suicide is culturally patterned. A cultural perspective, however, is rarely used to examine suicidal behavior among dominant groups in industrialized countries. This study explored the culture of suicide in the U. S. Mountain West region. Specifically, it examined the perceived precipitants and protectors of older adult suicide in a Mountain West community with higher than national average rates of older adult suicide, particularly among males of European-American descent. Respondents read a fictional local obituary of an older male or older female who died by suicide. They indicated what they believed were the two most likely precipitants, the number of suicides due to those precipitants, and the three most effective protective factors. Physical illness and death of a first-degree relative were ranked as the most likely suicide precipitants. Illness was thought to be a more likely precipitant than interpersonal or impersonal problems. Family, friends, religious beliefs, and counseling were believed to be the most effective suicide protectors. These findings add to past evidence of a belief, among European Americans, that physical illness is a key influence in older adult suicide. This belief may act as a cultural script for older adults of European-American descent, particularly males, given the association between physical integrity and dominant masculinity.

AB Background An accumulating body of research demonstrates that risk of suicide varies between occupational groups. Identification of the occupations at risk, and the factors that contribute to the increased risk of suicide in these groups is essential for the development of effective suicide prevention strategies. There is preliminary evidence to suggest that veterinary surgeons are a group at risk.
   Aims To conduct a systematic review of studies of rates and methods of suicide in the veterinary profession.
   Methods A systematic search of the international research literature was performed in May 2008. The data from the 19 studies of the prevalence of suicide in the veterinary profession were extracted by two independent reviewers and analysed.
   Results Between 0 and 43% of veterinary surgeon deaths were due to suicide. In all but one of the 15 studies presenting risk of suicide in veterinary surgeons with a comparison population, an elevated risk was found. The better quality studies with the lowest risk of bias indicated that in the UK, the rate of suicide in the veterinary profession was at least three times the general population rate. Studies of the methods of suicide veterinary surgeons use suggest that self-poisoning and firearms are particularly common.
   Conclusions There appears to be an elevated risk of suicide for veterinary surgeons in several countries. Access to means of suicide influences the methods used and may contribute to increased risk.

AB Suicide accounts for over 30,000 deaths per year in the United States and is associated with psychiatric illness and substance abuse. Research suggests a strong relationship between method of suicide and the lethal means that are readily available in one's community of residence. However, certain individuals may also seek the opportunity for suicide outside their proximal environment, often in well-known places. Whereas prevention efforts have been aimed at certain repeatedly used sites for suicide (i.e., Golden Gate Bridge), little research has studied "suicide tourism," the phenomenon of out of town accompanied by suicide. We collected data on all suicide deaths in New York City (NYC) between 1990 and 2004 from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of NYC. We examined trends and correlates of out-of-town residents who committed suicide in NYC. Manhattan accounted for 274 of the 407 nonresident suicides in NYC, which represented over 10% of all suicides committed in Manhattan. The most common methods of suicide for the Manhattan nonresidents were long fall, hanging, overdose, drowning, and firearms; the most common locations included hotels and commercial buildings, followed by outside locations such as bridges, parks, and streets: Nonresident victims tended to be younger, more often white and Asian and less often black and Hispanic than their residential counterparts. An analysis of nonresident suicides in Manhattan revealed that it is a location where individuals travel and take their lives, often by similar means and in similar locations. A comparison with residential suicide implied that a different type of individual is at risk for nonresidential suicide, and further research and prevention efforts should be considered.

AB Women, particularly educated White women, are at the forefront of the U.S. physician-assisted-suicide legalization movement, as advocates and leaders. They also represent half of decedents by physician-assisted suicide, though they are a minority among unassisted-suicide decedents. The dominant physician-assisted-suicide narrative is framed in terms of choice. This article focuses on the rhetoric and the reality of choice in physician-assisted suicide for White women in the united States, consistent with an intersectional perspective and with attention to context. It examines the idea of choice in physician-assisted suicide in light of women's lives, and also considering dominant narratives of physician-assisted suicide and of femininity. A mix of privilege (e.g., White women's good-enough experiences with medical systems. relative to ethnic-minority women) and disadvantage (e.g., White women's economic and care challenges. given their longevity but in poor health), combined with dominant physicianassisted-suicide rhetoric (e.g., physician-assisted-suicide as a death of dignity and graceful self-determination) and dominant-femininity ideals (e.g., femininity as graceful self-abnegation), likely contribute to White women's strong participation in physician-assisted suicide. The implications for professional psychology of intersectional and contextual perspectives on physician-assisted-suicide discourses and practices are discussed.

AB Background Debate continues about antidepressants and suicide. However, there are few recent nation-wide data about antidepressant overdoses. The purpose of this stud, was to describe United States trends from 1983 through 2003 in antidepressant overdoses as well as trends in health care utilization and mortality.
   Methods Data were obtained from the American Association of Poison Control Centers' (AAPPC) Toxic Exposure Surveillance System (TESS), the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) of emergency departments, and the National Hospital Discharge Survey(NHDS).
   Results Antidepressant overdose reports rose dramatically in the United States (from 0.61 per 10000 population in 1983 to 3.26 per 10000 population in 2003) chiefly due to the rise in selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) ingestion. However, fatalities per antidepressant overdose report declined from 73 per 10000 reported ingestions to 32 per 10000 ingestions. Tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdoses had higher rates of hospitalization (78.7 vs. 64.7% hospitalized) and much higher fatality rates than did SSRI overdose reports (0.73 vs. 0.14% mortality). If the 55 977 SSRI overdoses in 2003 had represented TCA overdoses, then (other things being equal) approximately 410 fatalities would have been expected but only 106 people died. Emergency department visits associated with antidepressant overdose increased along with all emergency department visits. Hospitalization associated with antidepressant overdose increased in the early 1980s but then reached a plateau while overall hospitalizations declined.
   Conclusions The dramatic rise in United States antidepressant overdoses has not been reflected in antidepressant overdose fatalities nor in hospitalizations. If the marked increase in antidepressant overdoses in the United States had involved TCAs rather than SSRIs, then there would have been roughly 300 excess deaths annually.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB Objective: To identify alcohol-related factors that influence mortality rates from suicide.
   Method: We examined the impact of per capita consumption of total alcohol, spirits, beer, and wine; unemployment rate; and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) membership rate on total, male and female suicide mortality rates in Manitoba during 1976 to 1997. Time series analyses with autoregressive integrated moving average modelling were applied to total, male and female suicide rates. The analyses performed included total alcohol consumption, spirits consumption, beer consumption, and wine consumption. Missing AA membership data were interpolated with cubic splines.
   Results: Total alcohol consumption, and consumption of beer, spirits, and wine individually, were significantly and positively related to female suicide mortality rates. Spirits and wine were positively related to total and male mortality rates. AA membership rates were negatively related to total and female suicide rates. Unemployment rates were positively related to male and total suicide rates.
   Conclusions: The data confirm the important relations between per capita consumption measures and suicide mortality rates. Additionally, the results for AA membership rates are consistent with the hypothesis that AA membership and alcohol abuse treatment can exert beneficial effects observable at the population level.

AB Objective: We examined adolescent suicide risks using the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey (YRBS). Methods: Suicide risk variables were analyzed individually and as a composite measure. Ten correlates were dichotomized for analyses: sex, sexual identity, forced sex, unsafe at school, current cigarette use, current alcohol use, weight perceptions, academic grades, hours of sleep, and hours on computer. Results: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) results for the suicide index indicated that only weight perception was not statistically significant. Logistic regression analyzed multivariate effects on disaggregated index items. For sad/hopeless and consider suicide, all correlates were statistically significant. For suicide planning, only weight perception was not statistically significant. Finally, for attempt suicide, neither weight perceptions nor computer use was statistically significant for younger students; all variables were statistically significant for older students. Conclusions: Certain suicide risk factors are predictive across grade levels and some are specific to older versus younger cohorts. Parents, teachers, and school administrators can reinforce each other by encouraging relevant/sensitive education efforts. Future prevention/intervention programs should be mindful of the particular demographics of intended audience, who must see the utility of efforts relative to their own needs and values.

AB OBJECTIVE: To estimate the rates of pregnancy-associated homicide and suicide in a multistate sample from the National Violent Death Reporting System, to compare these rates with other causes of maternal mortality, and to describe victims' demographic characteristics.
   METHODS: We analyzed data from female victims of reproductive age from 2003 to 2007. We identified pregnancy-associated violent deaths as deaths attributable to homicide or suicide during pregnancy or within the first year postpartum, and we calculated the rates of pregnancy-associated homicide and suicide as the number of deaths per 100,000 live births in the sample population. We used descriptive statistics to report victims' demographic characteristics and prevalence of intimate-partner violence.
   RESULTS: There were 94 counts of pregnancy-associated suicide and 139 counts of pregnancy-associated homicide, yielding pregnancy-associated suicide and homicide rates of 2.0 and 2.9 deaths per 100,000 live births, respectively. Victims of pregnancy-associated suicide were significantly more likely to be older and white or Native American as compared with all live births in National Violent Death Reporting System states. Pregnancy-associated homicide victims were significantly more likely to be at the extremes of the age range and African American. In our study, 54.3% of pregnancy-associated suicides involved intimate partner conflict that appeared to contribute to the suicide, and 45.3% of pregnancy-associated homicides were associated with intimate-partner violence.
   CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that pregnancy-associated homicide and suicide are important contributors to maternal mortality and confirm the need to evaluate the relationships between sociodemographic disparities and intimate-partner violence with pregnancy-associated violent death.

AB OBJECTIVES To identify comorbidity profiles of older patients last seen in primary care before a suicide attempt and assess attempt and clinical factors (eg, means and lethality of attempt) associated with these profiles. DESIGN Cohort study and latent class analysis using Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) national data (2012-2014). SETTING All VA medical centers in the United States. PARTICIPANTS A total of 2131 patients 65 years and older who were last seen by a primary care provider before a first documented suicide attempt. MEASUREMENTS Fatal suicide attempt and means were identified using the National Suicide Data Repository. Nonfatal attempt was defined using the National Suicide Prevention Applications Network. Medical and psychiatric diagnoses and other variables were determined from electronic medical records. RESULTS Patients (mean age = 74.4 y; 98.2% male) were clustered into five classes based on medical and psychiatric diagnoses: Minimal Comorbidity (23.2%); Chronic Pain-Osteoarthritis (30.1%); Depression-Chronic Pain (22.9%); Depression-Medical Comorbidity (16.5%); and High Comorbidity (7.3%). The patients in the Minimal Comorbidity and Chronic Pain-Osteoarthritis classes were most likely to attempt fatally compared with classes with a higher burden of comorbidities. Overall, 61% of the sample attempted fatally, and 82.5% of suicide decedents used firearms. CONCLUSION This study provides evidence that most comorbidity profiles (>50%) in primary care patients attempting suicide were characterized by minimal depression diagnoses and fatal attempts, mostly with firearms. These findings suggest that more than a depression diagnosis contributes to risk and that conversations about firearm safety by medical providers may play an important role in suicide intervention and prevention.

AB For the clinician who works in a behavioral-medicine or primary-care setting, this article presents the association between medical illness and suicide. Specific illnesses such as HIV/AIDS, cancers of the brain and nervous system, and multiple sclerosis all are associated with an increased risk of suicide. Rates of major depression rise with increasing rates of serious medical illness; however, depression and associated suicidal ideation tend to be undertreated in the medically ill. When medical illness becomes terminal, the clinician's patient may be confronted with difficult end-of-life decisions. Great concern exists in the United States about the ethics of end-of-life decision making and the issue of physician-assisted suicide, The latter part of this article examines the terminally ill patient's right to refuse life-sustaining treatments or to have death hastened according to the principle of the "double effect." it also reviews psychologists' apparent acceptance of the concept of rational suicide, as well as assisted suicide under certain conditions; and offers several caveats. A reexamination of psychology's role, standards, and principles with respect to rational suicide is recommended. (C) 2000 John Wiley a Sons, Inc.

AB BACKGROUND: Reducing maternal mortality is a priority in the United States and worldwide. Drug-related deaths and suicide may account for a substantial and growing portion of maternal deaths, yet information on the incidence of and sociodemographic variation in these deaths is scarce.
   OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine incidence of drug-related and suicide deaths in the 12 months after delivery, including heterogeneity by sociodemographic factors. We also explored maternal decedents' health care utilization prior to death.
   STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective, population-based cohort study followed up 1,059,713 women who delivered a live-born infant in California hospitals during 2010-2012 to ascertain maternal death. Analyses were conducted using statewide, all-payer, longitudinally-linked hospital and death data.
   RESULTS: A total of 300 women died during follow-up, a rate of 28.33 deaths per 100,000 person-years. The leading cause of death was obstetric-related problems (6.52 per 100,000 person-years). Drug-related deaths were the second leading cause of death (3.68 per 100,000 person-years), and suicide was the seventh leading cause (1.42 per 100,000 person-years); together these deaths comprised 18% of all maternal deaths. Non-Hispanic white women, Medicaid-insured women, and women residing in micropolitan areas were especially likely to die from drugs/suicide. Two thirds of women who died, including 74% of those who died by drugs/suicide, made >= 1 emergency department or hospital visit between their delivery and death.
   CONCLUSION: Deaths caused by drugs and suicide are a major contributor to mortality in the postpartum period and warrant increased clinical attention, including recognition by physicians and Maternal Mortality Review Committees as a medical cause of death. Importantly, emergency department and inpatient hospital visits may serve as a point of identification of, and eventually prevention for, women at risk for these deaths.

AB Glenn and colleagues have examined rates of adolescent suicide across 45 countries and explored the role of sex, age, rurality and availability of guns and railways on suicide rates. Higher rates of adolescent suicide in New Zealand may be explained by the very high rate of adolescent suicide in young Maoris. Future work could be enhanced by reporting on national trends in suicide, reporting on rates broken down by race and ethnicity, and through the development of international psychological autopsy studies that could shed light on cross-country differences. While this article found that income inequality was correlated with the male-to-female ratio of adolescent suicide across countries, the opposite trend has been reported in the United States. However, as noted by this article, the effects of poverty matter. The Move To Opportunity study found that when youth under the age of 13 were moved from a high poverty to a low poverty neighbourhood, there were enduring effects, including lower levels of depression and anxiety. While adolescent suicide is a global concern, reduction in the suicide rate may have local solutions, including those that address the pernicious effects of poverty and poor neighbourhoods on youth.

AB Aim: To examine rates of contact with primary and mental health care prior to suicide in men and women and across a range of age categories. Method: The authors performed a systematic review of 44 studies from 2000 to 2017 of which 36 reported rates on contact with primary health care and 14 reported on contact with mental health care prior to suicide. Results: Contact with primary health care was highest in the year prior to suicide with an average contact rate of 80%. At one month, the average rate was 44%. The lifetime contact rate for mental health care was 57%, and 31% in the final 12 months. In general, women and those over 50 years of age had the highest rates of contact with health care prior to suicide. Conclusions: Contact with primary health care prior to suicide is common even in the final month before death. The findings presented in this study highlight the importance of placing suicide prevention strategies and interventions within the primary health care setting.

AB Suicidal behavior is a significant problem among adolescents in the United States. Three types of school-based suicide prevention programs have been proposed to address this problem including curriculum programs, staff in-service training, and school-wide screening. The relative acceptability of these three programs among older adolescents was examined. The sample included 662 freshmen (496 females, 161 males) enrolled in a large private university. Respondents rated the degree to which they considered adolescent suicide to be a significant problem, and the acceptability, intrusiveness, and time demands of the three suicide prevention programs. A majority (85.9%) of the sample agreed that adolescent suicide was a significant problem. Significant gender differences were observed in relation to the acceptability ratings of the school-based suicide programs. Female participants rated the curriculum-based program and staff in-service training as more acceptable than mate participants. In addition, female participants rated the curriculum-based program assignificantly less intrusive and less time demanding than male participants. Implications of these findings for implementation of suicide prevention programs and for future research are discussed. (c) 2006 Society for the Study of School Psychology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Given that suicidality is a well-known symptom and outcome of untreated or inadequately treated depressive illness, the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warning of emergent suicidality in children and adolescents based on the antidepressant arm of placebo-controlled randomized trials (RCTs) has created understandable concern in clinical practice. The issues involved are of broader public health importance for all age groups. As in other branches of medicine, psychiatrists must always be vigilant of the rare risk of iatrogenesis when prescribing potent agents like antidepressants for patients with depressive disorders where the risk of suicidality is inherent. The overall evidence we review suggests that the widespread use of antidepressants in the new "SSRI-era" appear to have actually led to highly significant decline in suicide rates in most countries with traditionally high baseline suicide rates. The decline is particularly striking for women who, compared with men, seek more help for depression. Recent clinical data on large samples in the US too have revealed a protective effect of antidepressant against suicide.
   We argue that the discrepancy between RCTs (in children) and national and clinical suicide statistics (in adults) may reside in new provocative data documenting high rates of unrecognized pseudo-unipolar mixed states particularly in juvenile, but also in adult, clinical populations. Such an interpretation accords well with equally provocative data that bipolar 11 (which is often "mixed" in nature) may well represent a particularly vulnerable clinical substrate for suicidality. In this respect, the widespread (at least in the psychiatric sector) augmentation of antidepressants with benzodiazepines, atypical antipsychotics or mood stabilizers may represent one situation where current practice is superior to evidence-based medicine. We conclude that rather than being a threat, the judicious clinical use of antidepressants actually does serve to effectively treat and indeed protect depressed patients from suicidal outcome. The fact of being in treatment with regular clinical follow-up appears beneficial as well. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO INJURY PREVENTION

ID CRIME
AB Objective: To determine if any of five different state gun laws were associated with firearm mortality: ( 1) " shall issue'' laws permitting an individual to carry a concealed weapon unless restricted by another statute; ( 2) a minimum age of 21 years for handgun purchase; ( 3) a minimum age of 21 years for private handgun possession; ( 4) one gun a month laws which restrict handgun purchase frequency; and ( 5) junk gun laws which ban the sale of certain cheaply constructed handguns.
   Design: A cross sectional time series study of firearm mortality from 1979 to 1998.
   Setting: All 50 states and the District of Columbia.
   Subjects: All residents of the United States.
   Main outcome measures: Firearm homicides, all homicides, firearm suicides, and all suicides.
   Results: When a " shall issue'' law was present, the rate of firearm homicides was greater, RR 1.11 ( 95% confidence interval 0.99 to 1.24), than when the law was not present, as was the rate of all homicides, RR 1.08 ( 95% CI 0.98 to 1.17), although this was not statistically significant. No law was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the rates of firearm homicides or total homicides. No law was associated with a statistically significant change in firearm suicide rates.
   Conclusion: A " shall issue'' law that eliminates most restrictions on carrying a concealed weapon may be associated with increased firearm homicide rates. No law was associated with a statistically significant reduction in firearm homicide or suicide rates.

AB This paper builds a case for examining suicide in the U.S. military relative to broad societal context, specifically, the unique experiences of birth cohorts relating to processes described by Durkheim's theory of suicide. In more recent birth cohorts, suicide rates have increased among teenagers and young adults. In addition, suicide rates of age intervals at a given time period have been reliably predicted by the size of the birth cohort and the percentage of nonmarital births-supposed indicators of Durkheim's diminished social integration and behavioral regulation. Consequences of these trends are likely more evident in the U.S. military due to having proportionally more individuals known to be at risk for suicide, that is, young males who are from nontraditional households. The all-volunteer force compared to draft force has fewer applicants to select, and proportionally more of applicants are accepted for military service. Consequently, more recruits having varied conditions now than before, perhaps including greater vulnerability to suicide, serve in the U.S. military. These points are further elaborated with supporting evidence, concluding with a call for new directions in suicide research, practice, and policy.

AB Objective: To identify the factors associated with suicide ideation among medically and surgically hospitalized patients.
   Methods: A consecutive sample of 4328 individuals admitted to a general hospital completed a screening questionnaire comprised of demographic and clinical information, the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview item on current suicide ideation, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale subscale for depression and the Alcohol use Disorder Identification Test. A multiple logistic regression produced a discriminate profile of individuals with suicide ideation.
   Results: The prevalence rate for current suicide ideation was 4.9% (95% Cl: 4.3-5.6). Patients admitted to the Infectious Disease, Oncology and Hematology units presented higher rates of suicide ideation (7.9%, 7.8% and 7.2%, respectively). Suicidal ideation was associated to depression [odds ratio (OR)=8.3], young age (18-35 years old: OR=2.5), alcohol use disorders (OR=2.3), and smoking (OR=1.8).
   Conclusion: Suicidal ideation was consistently associated with indicators of mental disorders. It is proxy, not for completed suicide, but for a variety of common psychiatric conditions that can and should be dealt with in the medical/surgical setting. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.

   Homicide
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE
LA English

ID UNITED-STATES; VIOLENCE; LAWS
AB Introduction: The aim of this study was to assess the association between state firearm legislation and female intimate partner homicide.
   Methods: In 2017, the authors conducted a secondary data analysis of 16 states from 2010 to 2014, using data from the National Violent Death Reporting System, the State Firearm Law Database, and additional public sources. Poisson regression analyses quantified the association between the number of state restrictive firearm legislative provisions and the female population-based intimate partner homicide rate. For etiologic reasons, intimate partner homicide was disaggregated into homicide-suicide (intimate partner homicide followed by perpetrator suicide) and homicide-only intimate partner homicide (intimate partner homicide in the absence of perpetrator suicide).
   Results: There were 1,693 female intimate partner homicide deaths in the 16 states during 2010-2014; 67% were homicide-only intimate partner homicide. The number of state-level legislative provisions related to firearm restrictions ranged from four (Alaska) to 95 (Massachusetts). The intimate partner homicide rate in states with zero to 39 provisions was 1.16 per 100,000 person years (95% CI=1.10, 1.22) and in states with >40 provisions was 0.68 per 100,000 person years (95% CI=0.61, 0.72). The incidence of female intimate partner homicide was 56% lower in states with >= 40 legislative provisions (adjusted incidence rate ratio=0.44, 95% CI=0.28, 0.68), relative to states with zero to 39 provisions. This protective association was stronger for homicide-only intimate partner homicide than homicide-suicide intimate partner homicide.
   Conclusions: More state-level restrictive firearm legislation is associated with a lower rate of female intimate partner homicides. (C) 2019 American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The nature of rurality varies considerably across the world, and there is no single pattern of suicide in rural areas. However, some common themes are evident from countries as diverse as India, the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, and China. Suicide rates tend to be higher in rural populations compared with urban, with relatively higher female rates in some areas. North American and Australian data suggest that indigenous people may be at particularly high risk. Specific rural occupations, such as farming, often seem to be associated with higher risk. Although mental illness plays an important role in suicide in rural areas, as it does elsewhere, it is unclear whether higher rural suicide rates are linked to a correspondingly higher prevalence of mental illness in such populations. Instead, other factors may be important including: adverse socio-economic conditions; higher rates of alcohol or substance misuse; greater access to potentially lethal methods, such as pesticides or firearms; cultural attitudes which promote independence and discourage help-seeking behaviour; poor access to services providing help at times of psychological crisis; and cultural discontinuity in traditional societies. Not all factors apply in all areas, hence, the literature on rural suicide prevention initiatives varies considerably. Strategies have involved: the restriction of access to lethal methods; improving attitudes to, and knowledge of, mental illness in high-risk populations; improving the accessibility of conventional mental health services; making the use of such supports more culturally acceptable; and the development of context-specific supports, such as programmes addressing specific cultural issues.

AB Objective: Risk for suicide is often higher among college students, compared to same-age noncollegiate peers, and may be exacerbated by quality of social support and interactions. The authors examined the independent contributions of positive social support and negative social exchanges to suicide ideation and attempts in college students. Participants: Participants were 439 volunteer undergraduate students, who were primarily female (71%). Methods: Cross-sectional, survey design. Participants completed measures assessing positive social support, including emotional, informational, and tangible support; negative social exchanges; and suicidal behavior, including ideation and attempts. Results: Positive social support, particularly tangible support, and negative social exchanges were significantly predictive of greater suicidal behavior. Conclusions: Practical manifestations of support may buffer against suicide risk for college students, whereas conflict-based interactions may contribute to increased risk. At the institutional, parental, and peer levels, promotion of supportive relationships may be an important suicide prevention strategy.

AB There is little research to distinguish those who attempt suicide and those who only consider suicide, and the role that substance use plays in this progression. We aim to describe clinical correlates of suicide attempters versus ideators in substance users. We examined characteristics of substance users (N = 185) that had either a suicide attempt within the last 6months (n = 94) or were suicide ideators (n = 91). Suicide attempters displayed significant different clinical profiles to that of non-attemptors. Relative to ideators, attempters had greater scores on impulsivity, the brief psychiatric scale and more likely to be female and a recent psychostimulant user. Logistic regression revealed that male gender was associated with a decreased odds of a previous suicide attempt (OR = 0.37, p < 0.05) and greater impulsivity scores were associated with increased odds of an attempt (OR = 1.15, p < 0.05), although entering interaction terms diminished the role of impulsivity and revealed a significant interaction of alcohol use x depression. While impulsivity was a significant predictor of suicide attempt relative to depression or alcohol use alone, this reduced when considering interactions between psychological characteristics and substance use, whereby the effect of alcohol use on the likelihood of a recent suicide attempt varied at different levels of depression.

AB Suicidal behavior is a major problem worldwide and, at the same time, has received relatively little empirical attention. This relative lack of empirical attention may be due in part to a relative absence of theory development regarding suicidal behavior. The current article presents the interpersonal theory of suicidal behavior. We propose that the most dangerous form of suicidal desire is caused by the simultaneous presence of two interpersonal constructs-thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness (and hopelessness about these states)-and further that the capability to engage in suicidal behavior is separate from the desire to engage in suicidal behavior. According to the theory, the capability for suicidal behavior emerges, via habituation and opponent processes, in response to repeated exposure to physically painful and/or fear-inducing experiences. In the current article, the theory's hypotheses are more precisely delineated than in previous presentations (Joiner, 2005), with the aim of inviting scientific inquiry and potential falsification of the theory's hypotheses.

AB Objective: To study the effects of college students' physical activity and gender on depressive and suicidal symptoms. Method: The National College Health Assessment survey was administered to college students nationwide. Data were analyzed with 4x2 ANOVAs and Games-Howell post hoc tests when appropriate. Results: More frequent physical activity related to less frequent depressive symptoms and consideration of suicide, but not with attempted suicide. Males reported depressive symptoms less frequently than did females. Conclusion: Depression research has implications for an increasingly sedentary college population. Institutions should provide increased access and knowledge pertaining to emotional health and psychological benefits through physical activity.

AB Aim. The aim of the paper was to: (1) present economic, socio-demographic and other indicators related to suicide, useful from the perspective of social integration theory, and (2) identify new indicators of special importance to contemporary Poland.
   Method. A narrative literature review on the sociological approach to suicide was undertaken by searching MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO, Google Scholar databases using the following key words: suicide, suicide risk factors, Durkheim 's theory of suicide, integration and disintegration of society, sociodemographic factors, economic factors, religion, and the time descriptors: 2000-2017.
   Results. Suicide risk was analyzed in relation to: family integration (including the rates of divorce, marriage, fertility, and women's participation in the labour market); economy (including the unemployment rate, gross domestic product per capita, Gini social inequality index, and social welfare indicators); social issues (including the indicators of the healthcare system quality, the rates of alcohol consumption per capita and migration); religion (including the parameters of conventional religiosity, Gallup index, and percentage of religious books). The issues relevant for Poland were addressed while discussing Balanced Development Index in economic aspect, and dominicantes and communicantes rates in religious aspect.
   Conclusions. This literature review may be useful in the assessment of suicide risk when designing suicide prevention programs and for mental health clinicians in their daily practice.

AB Background: Rates of suicide among older adults in the United States are higher than that of other age groups. Therefore, it is critically important to deepen understanding of the processes that drive suicide risk among at-risk older patients. To this end, we examined the longitudinal course of suicide ideation in a sample of treatment-seeking depressed adults 60 years of age or older.
   Methods: Secondary analyses were conducted with a longitudinal dataset including 343 older adults seeking treatment for depression in the context of a naturalistic treatment setting. Participants completed assessments of depressive symptoms and thoughts of suicide every three months for one year. Multi-level mixed models were used to examine the trajectory of suicide ideation over five waves.
   Results: Depressive symptoms contributed significantly to change in thoughts of suicide early in treatment for depression. Age-related differences were also observed, such that increasing age was associated with significantly greater reports of suicide ideation.
   Limitations: Use of a single measure to ascertain severity of depressive symptoms and thoughts of suicide.
   Conclusions: Clinicians should expect to see the most pronounced decrease in thoughts of suicide during the first two months of depression treatment for older adults. Further, clinicians should be especially vigilant to monitor suicide ideation for adults, with increasing vigilance for those at more advanced ages. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB It is nowadays accepted that, independently of methodological issues, women commit fewer suicides than men but make more frequent attempts. Yet, female suicidal risk varies greatly along the lifetime and is linked to the most significant moments in it. A wide analysis of the existing literature was performed to provide a narrative description on the evolution of female suicidal rates from childhood to old age, considering the milestones in their life history. A detailed analysis of gender differences in suicidal behavior is key to establish preventive measures and priorities. More specific studies are needed to adapt future interventions on female suicide.

DE hydrogen sulfide; suicide; post mortem
AB The authors report a case of suicide by hydrogen sulfide in Australia. A young woman was located in a car wearing protective eye-wear. A tub of foamy yellow substance and a quantity of hydrochloric acid and lime sulfur were also located in the rear of the vehicle. Morphological findings at autopsy were nonspecific. Toxicologic analysis of a specimen of leg blood detected elevated levels of methemoglobin.
   If Australia follows a similar trend to Japan and the United States, it is possible that incidences of such cases will rise, probably because of Internet dissemination. From a public health perspective, emergency service providers and forensic case workers should be aware of the potential hazards to themselves and others when dealing with such cases.

AB Suicide is an important public health difficulty and the third leading cause of death among young population. This study examines some of the demographic risk factors of suicidal behaviors in Savojbolagh city. In a retrospective, descriptive, and cross-sectional study, suicidal behaviors from March 2007 to March 2009 in Savojbolagh city were investigated. A unified questionnaire was designed in mental health research centre for data gathering. A total of 892 suicidal behavior reports were collected from the health facilities. Suicide attempts were more frequent in females, young people, the married, high school graduates, and housewives. The most common motive for suicide attempt was interpersonal quarrels and secondly, economical problems. Completed (fatal) suicide was higher in males, older people, and unemployed subjects. Demographic risk factors in any region or country are dependent upon the local factors such as socioeconomic status and cultural beliefs which need to be considered in suicide prevention planning.

AB Any lifetime history of injection drug use (IDU) is associated with markedly elevated rates of addiction to alcohol and other substances on a lifetime basis. In this population, substance use tends to manifest early in life, as do conduct problems such as school disciplinary problems, theft, fighting, and juvenile arrest. Many people who inject drugs will ultimately merit a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder. Rates of depressive illness and anxiety disorders are also high in this population, and IDU is associated with high rates of suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and completed suicide. The severity of social, medical, and psychiatric disability in this population poses significant treatment challenges.

AB Three theories have been proposed to explain the relationship between suicide and economic fluctuations, including the Durkheim (nonlinear), Ginsberg (procyclical), and Henry and Short (countercyclical) theories. This study tested the effect of economic fluctuations, measured by unemployment rate, on suicide rates in Canada from 1926 to 2008. Autoregressive integrated moving average time-series models were used. The results showed a significant relationship between suicide and economic fluctuation; this association was positive during the contraction period (1926-1950) and negative in the period of economic expansion (1951-1973). Males and females showed differential effects in the period of moderate unemployment (1974-2008). In addition, the suicide rate of mid-adults (45-64) was most impacted by economic fluctuations. Our study tends to support Durkheim's theory and suggests the need for public health responses in times of economic contraction and expansion.

ID UNITED-STATES
AB An influential study from the United States generated considerable discussion and debate. This study documented rising morbidity and mortality in midlife among white non-Hispanic Americans in the 21st century, with clear linkages of all-cause mortality to increasing rates of poisonings, suicides and chronic liver disease deaths. All of these causes of deaths are strongly related to the use of legal and illegal substances, but the study stressed the importance of prescription opioids. Given the similarities between the United States and Canada in prescription opioid use, the assessment of similar all-cause mortality trends is relevant for Canada. As this commentary highlights, the all-cause mortality shifts seen in the United States cannot be seen in Canada for either sex or age groups. The exact reasons for the differences between the two countries are not clear, but it is important for public health to further explore this question.

AB Background: In 2012, over 1.3 million U.S. adults reported that they attempted suicide in the past year, and 39,426 adults died by suicide. This study estimated national suicide case fatality rates among adult suicide attempters (fatal and nonfatal cases) and examined how they varied by sociodemographic characteristics.
   Methods: We pooled data on deaths by suicide (n = 147,427, fatal cases in the U.S.) from the 2008-2011 U S. mortality files and data on suicide attempters who survived (n = 2000 nonfatal cases) from the 2008-2012 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. Descriptive analyses and multivariable logistic regression models were applied.
   Results: Among adult suicide attempters in the U.S., the overall 12-month suicide case fatality rate was 3.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.9%-3.5%). It varied significantly by sociodemographic factors. For those aged 45 or older, the adjusted suicide case fatality rate was higher among men (7.6%) than among women (2.6%) (suicide case fatality rate ratio (SCFRR) = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.83-4.79), was higher among non Hispanic whites (7.9%) than among non-white minorities (0.8-2.5%) (SCFRRs = 3.2-9.9), and was higher among those with less than high school education (16.0%) than among college graduates (1.8%) (SCFRR = 8.8, 95% CI = 3.83-20.16). Across male and female attempters, being aged 45 or older and non Hispanic white and having less than secondary school were at a higher risk for death by suicide.
   Conclusions: Focusing on these demographic characteristics can help identify suicide attempters at higher risk for death by suicide, inform clinical assessments, and improve suicide prevention and intervention efforts by increasing high-risk suicide attempters' access to mental health treatment.

AB Background: Suicide prevention programs have become ubiquitous among military units; identifying temporal trends and nonclinical factors associated with the chosen suicide methods may help improve suicide prevention strategies.
   Objective: To calculate suicide rates of active duty military personnel and identify those who are at risk for firearm-specific suicide.
   Design: Retrospective cohort study.
   Setting: Military units in the United States.
   Patients: All active duty enlisted U.S. military personnel from 2005 to 2011.
   Measurements: Suicide rates per 100 000 were calculated for each branch. Adjusted odds ratios for firearm-specific suicide were calculated with 95% CIs.
   Results: 1455 military personnel committed suicide from 2005 to 2011. From 2006 to 2011, the rates were highest among army personnel (19.13 to 29.44 cases per 100 000). Among suicides with a known cause of death, 62% were attributed to firearms. The results of this study also suggest that among army personnel or marines who committed suicide, those with infantry or special operations job classifications were more likely than those in non-infantry positions to use a firearm.
   Limitations: Results are generalizable only to enlisted personnel and reflect only stateside suicides. Data regarding previous psychiatric illness, deployment history, and firearms ownership were lacking.
   Conclusion: These results may help inform policymakers and advisors about differences in risks of suicide and violent suicide among the armed services and may help guide efforts to prevent self-harm within the military.

AB Background: Past research suggests that suicide has a profound impact on surviving family members and friends; yet, little is known about experiences with suicide bereavement among military populations. This study aimed to characterize experiences with suicide exposure and their associations with lifetime and current psychiatric symptoms among military service members and veterans.
   Methods: A sample of 1753 United States military service members and veterans completed self-report questionnaires assessing experiences with suicide exposure, lifetime history of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, current suicidal symptoms, and perceived likelihood of making a future suicide attempt.
   Results: The majority of participants (57.3%) reported knowing someone who had died by suicide, and of these individuals, most (53.1%) reported having lost a friend to suicide. Chi-square tests, one-way ANOVAs, and logistic regression analyses revealed that those who reported knowing a suicide decedent were more likely to report more severe current suicidal symptoms and a history of suicidal thoughts and behaviors compared to those who did not know a suicide decedent. Hierarchical linear regression analyses indicated that greater self reported interpersonal closeness to a suicide decedent predicted greater self-reported likelihood of a future suicide attempt, even after controlling for current suicidal symptoms and prior suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
   Limitations: This study utilized cross-sectional data, and information regarding degree of exposure to suicide was not collected.
   Conclusions: Military personnel and veterans who have been bereaved by suicide may themselves be at elevated risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Additional work is needed to delineate the relationship between these experiences.

AB Self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs), including nonsuicidal self-injury, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts, and suicide death exhibit substantial sex differences. Across most countries, men die by suicide more frequently than women; yet, women think about and attempt suicide more frequently than men. Research on sex differences in nonsuicidal self-injury is less developed; however, nonsuicidal self-injury is historically understood as a primarily female phenomenon. This review describes current research on sex differences across SITBs with a focus on factors that moderate these effects, such as age, race, geographic region, and time. Additionally, this review describes factors that may help to explain why sex differences across SITBs exist, including differences in culture, access to lethal suicide methods, rates of mental illness, and utilization of health care. The role of gender, and particularly non-binary gender, is also discussed. Current understanding of these sex differences is described with an eye toward future research on this topic.

AB Objective: To analyze sex differences in demographic and clinical characteristics of individuals who died by suicide in Mexico City.
   Method: Statistical analysis of residents of Mexico City whose cause of death was suicide, during two years period from January 2014 to December 2015, with a coroner's report. Suicide mortality rates were calculated by age, sex, and location within the city. The Chi-squared test was used to assess statistical differences.
   Results: From January 2014 to December 2015, 990 residents of Mexico City died by suicide (men: 78.28%, women: 21.72%). Among males, the highest mortality rates were among the groups of 20-24 and 75-79 years old, whereas in women, the group with the highest mortality rate was 15 to 19 years old. 74% of the sample used hanging as suicide method. However, men had higher rates of a positive result in the toxicology test (40%) (p < 0.05). There was no concordance between male and female suicide by city jurisdictions.
   Conclusion: Our results provide evidence that the characteristics of Mexico City's residents who committed suicide had significant sex-related differences, including where they used to live. Understanding the contributory factors associated with completed suicide is essential for the development of effective preventive strategies.

AB Suicidal behavior in children and youth continues to be a major public health problem in the United States. School personnel have a legal and ethical obligation to recognize and respond to the mental health needs of their students and to take steps to ensure their safety. In this exploratory study, suicide risk assessment practices of three large school districts were examined. More than 3,400 suicide risk assessments were conducted in these districts during the 3 years considered. The results indicate that all three districts have implemented suicide prevention programs that include risk-assessment practices in an effort to reduce suicidality. Suicides risk assessments were conducted with at least one child in each grade from kindergarten through 12(th) in each district, occurring most frequently at the middle school level. Differences by gender were noted in terms of level of risk and hospitalizations, but no significant differences were observed based on race/ethnicity. These risk assessment efforts of these three districts appear to be promising in preventing suicides: none of the students who were assessed went on to commit suicide. Implications for school-based practices and training are discussed. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Background: Suicide is a serious public health problem. Prevention of suicide depends to a great degree on identification and mitigation of its risk factors. Allergy has been associated with mood and anxiety disorders, risk factors for suicidality. Antiallergic medication could modulate or mediate these predictive associations. Recently, the FDA issued a warning raising concerns about the suicidality potential of montelukast and other leukotriene (LT) antagonists. Objective: The purpose of this review is to integrate the emerging interpretations of the link between suicidality, suicide risk factors, allergy and treatment of allergy in particular, with LT antagonists. Methods: We reviewed the available reports on the possible relationships between montelukast, allergy, suicide, suicidality and suicide risk factors. We also present the positions of the FDA, manufacturer, and national organizations of allergists and immunologists on the possible role of montelukast in suicidality. Conclusion: At present, there is insufficient data to prove that there is a link between montelukast and suicidality. Inquiring about mood changes and suicidal ideation should be integrated in general medical practice.

AB The authors developed the Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview (SITBI) and evaluated its psychometric properties. The SITBI is a structured interview that assesses the presence, frequency, and characteristics of a wide range of self-injurious thoughts and behaviors, including suicidal ideation, suicide plans, suicide gestures, suicide attempts, and nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI). This initial study, based on the administration of the SITBI to 94 adolescents and young adults, suggested that the SITBI has strong interrater reliability (average kappa =.99, kappa = 1.0) and test-retest reliability (average kappa = .70, intraclass correlation coefficient =.44) over a 6-month period. Moreover, concurrent validity was demonstrated via strong correspondence between the SITBI and other measures of suicidal ideation (average kappa =.54), suicide attempt (kappa =.65), and NSSI (average kappa =.87). The authors concluded that the SITBI uniformly and comprehensively assesses a wide range of self-injury-related constructs and provides a new instrument that can be administered with relative ease in both research and clinical settings.

AB Objective Individuals living in rural areas die by suicide at higher rates than those living in metropolitan areas. Telemental health interventions provide rural residing individuals with access to needed care. Identifying telemental health clients at risk for suicide is an important task for clinicians and policymakers. This study evaluated to what degree rural status and other demographic variables predicted suicide ideation in clients seeking services at a telemental health clinic.
   Methods Study participants included 457 low-income clients residing in the medically underserved, geographically diverse Brazos Valley region of Texas. Clients completed the patient health questionnaire during their initial counseling appointment, which assessed depression severity and suicide ideation in the 2 weeks prior to assessment.
   Results Suicide ideation was common among telemental health clients, with approximately 40% of clients in all demographic groups reporting some recent thoughts of suicide. Rates of suicide ideation did not significantly differ by geographic designation (ie, rural/metropolitan status), gender, or race/ethnicity. However, depression was a strong predictor of recent suicide ideation.
   Conclusions Telemental health programs can effectively connect clinicians with rural residing clients who are otherwise isolated from health care services. However, clinicians working in high-need, historically underserved areas should be prepared to encounter a high prevalence of suicide ideation and depression. In these regions, clinical and diagnostic features may be better indicators of suicide ideation than demographic variables.

AB Despite substantial research on media influences and the development of media guidelines on suicide reporting, research on the specifics of media stories that facilitate suicide contagion has been limited. The goal of the present study was to develop a content analytic strategy to code features in media suicide reports presumed to be influential in suicide contagion and determine the interrater reliability of the qualitative characteristics abstracted from newspaper stories. A random subset of 151 articles from a database of 1,851 newspaper suicide stories published during 1988 through 1996, which were collected as part of a national study in the United States to identify factors associated with the initiation of youth suicide clusters, were evaluated. Using a well-defined content-analysis procedure, the agreement between raters in scoring key concepts of suicide reports from the headline, the pictorial presentation, and the text were evaluated. The results show that while the majority of variables in the content analysis were very reliable, assessed using the k statistic, and obtained excellent percentages of agreement, the reliability of complicated constructs, such as sensationalizing, glorifying, or romanticizing the suicide, was comparatively low. The data emphasize that before effective guidelines and responsible suicide reporting can ensue, further explication of suicide story constructs is necessary to ensure the implementation and compliance of responsible reporting on behalf of the media.

AB What is the best way to care for a child with severe neurologic impairment who seems to be dying and is in intractable pain? Can we give sedation as we remove life support? Is it ethically permissible to hasten death? In the United States, 5 states have legalized assisted suicide (although only for competent adults). In Belgium and the Netherlands, euthanasia is legal for children under some circumstances. We present a case in which parents and doctors face difficult decisions about palliative care. Experts from Belgium, the Netherlands, and the United States then discuss how they would respond to such a case.

AB Background: Multivariate studies of specific suicide means are relatively rare, given the logistical challenges associated with the low base rate of suicide in the general population. Thus, information on individual characteristics associated with specific suicide means remains relatively wanting. The current study provided the largest examination to date of sociodemographic characteristics associated with different means of lethality among suicide decedents, using data from a multi-state population-based surveillance system.
   Methods: Multivariate logistic regression was used with data for 20,577 suicide decedents in the National Violent Death Reporting System from 2003 to 2005.
   Results: Firearm decedents were more likely male, elderly, non-Hispanic white, married, veterans, and born in the U.S. Hanging and suffocation decedents were more likely male, young, racial/ethnic minorities, never married, non-veterans, and foreign-born. Decedents that jumped from heights were more likely female, older, non-Hispanic black, never married, non-veterans, and foreign-born. Decedents who used sharp instruments were more likely older, never married, and foreign-born. Self-poisoned decedents were more likely female, middle-age, non-Hispanic white, and not married. Regarding specific poisons, alcohol was more likely to be used by middle-age decedents; gas by males, elderly, and married individuals; over-the-counter drugs by females, adolescents, and foreign-born decedents; prescription drugs by females, middle-aged, and U.S. born individuals; and street drugs by males and racial/ethnic minorities.
   Limitations: The data were drawn from 18 states and so cannot be regarded as nationally representative.
   Conclusions: Substantial sociodemographic variability exists across different suicide means. Recognition of this variability may help to tailor prevention efforts involving means restriction. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,

AB This study explores the relationship between church-based informal social support and lifetime prevalence of suicide ideation and attempts within a representative national sample of African American and Black Caribbean adults. Characteristics of church-based social support networks, as well as emotional support and negative interaction with church members were examined in relation to lifetime suicide ideation and attempts. This study used data from the National Survey of American Life (2001-2003). Frequency of interaction with church members was positively associated with suicide attempts, while subjective closeness to church members was negatively associated with suicide ideation. Emotional support, service attendance, and negative interaction with church members were unrelated to both suicide ideation and attempts. Findings are discussed in relation to research on church-based support networks, different models linking church support and suicidality, and the mechanisms by which church-based networks deter suicide ideation and attempts.

AB The present study compares dual-diagnosis patients with other groups of psychiatric patients to determine the differential characteristics in suicide risk and other clinical variables between them. During 2008 in Madrid, 837 outpatients were evaluated in addiction and mental health services. Three comparison groups were created according to current diagnosis: (i) dual patients, (ii) patients with substance use disorders but no other mental disorders, and (iii) patients with mental disorders but no substance use disorders. A multinomial logistic regression model was built to explore the risk associated with dual diagnosis. Criteria for dual diagnosis were met at the time of the study by 440 patients (52.6%). Dual patients showed several demographic and clinical differences and a higher risk for suicide than the other two comparison groups. Further research is needed to define suicide preventive strategies for dual patients.

   TREATMENT; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; MENTAL-HEALTH; RISK-FACTORS; INTERVENTION
AB Purpose of review
   Recent increases in adolescent suicide rates after a decade of decline highlight the relevance of pediatric suicide prevention. Existing strategies to intervene with youth at risk for suicide are largely based on the premise that access to effective services is of critical importance. This review aims to examine the relationship between youth suicide and access to care.
   Recent findings
   Promising reductions in suicidal thinking and behavior have been associated with the application of manualized psychotherapies, collaborative interventions in primary care, lithium for mood-disordered adults, and clozapine in schizophrenia. Suicide rates correlate inversely with indices of care access across the lifespan, including antidepressant prescription rates.
   Summary
   Suicide is a preventable cause of death, and any public health relevant effort to prevent youth suicide must include improving access to effective care for at-risk youth as a strategy. Education and training of professionals and consumers, the integration of mental health services in primary care, and the use of novel technologies to track and maintain contact with at-risk youth are worthy of study. Additional research on the relationship between specific treatments, especially antidepressants, and youth suicide risk reduction is desperately needed.

SO JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID RISK-FACTORS
AB Study objectives: Although stress is thought to be a risk factor for suicide, most research has been retrospective or has focused on attempted suicides or suicide ideation. This study examined prospectively the associations between self perceived stress, diazepam use, and death from suicide among adult women.
   Design: A cohort study was conducted with 14 years of follow up. Stress at home and at work were assessed by questionnaire and scored on a four point scale: minimal, light, moderate, or severe.
   Setting: Eleven states within the United States.
   Participants: Female nurses (n=94110) who were 3:6 to 61 years of age when they answered questions on stress and diazepam use in 1982.
   Results: During 1 272 000 person years of observation 73 suicides were identified. After adjustment for age, smoking, coffee consumption, alcohol intake, and marital status, the relation between self reported stress and suicide remained U shaped. Compared with the light home and work stress categories , which had the lowest incidences of suicide, risks were increased among women reporting either severe (relative risk (RR) = 3.7, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.7 to 8.3) or minimal (RR=2.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 4.5) home stress and either severe (RR=1.9, 95% CI 0.8 to 4.7) or minimal (RR=2.4, 95% CI 0.9 to 6. 1) work stress. When responses to home and work stress were combined, there was an almost fivefold increase in risk of suicide among women in the high stress category. Risk of suicide was over eightfold among women reporting high stress or diazepam use compared with those reporting low stress and no diazepam use.
   Conclusions: The relation between self reported stress and suicide seems to be U shaped among adult women. The excess risk for those reporting minimal stress may reflect denial or undiagnosed depression or an association with some other unmeasured risk factor for suicide.

AB This literature review examines intimate partner violence in relation to pregnancy-associated femicide and suicide. Empirical publications were eligible for review if they included information on intimate partner violence and examined females who were pregnant/postpartum and who were victims of femicide/attempted femicide and/or suicide/attempted suicide. Nine publications met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Results suggest that intimate partners perpetrate one- to two-thirds of the pregnancy-associated femicides in the United States and that pregnant women make up 5% of urban intimate partner femicides. Intimate partner abuse during pregnancy appears to be a risk factor for severe intimate partner violence, including attempted/completed femicide. So little information exists concerning intimate partner violence in pregnancy-associated suicides that it is impossible to draw conclusions regarding this topic; however, a hospital-based study suggests that intimate partner violence may be a risk factor for attempting suicide while pregnant. More research is needed concerning intimate partner pregnancy-associated femicide and suicide so that evidenced-based preventive/therapeutic interventions may be developed.

AB Youths who are lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) are more likely than heterosexuals to commit suicide. Substance use, PTSD, and depression are independent risk factors for suicidality; however, the extent to which these factors interact to predict suicidality is unclear. The current study examined the association between substance use, PTSD symptoms (PTSS), depressive symptoms, and suicidality in a sample of 68 traumatized minority LGB youths. Participants were recruited from an LGBT community center and completed a packet of questionnaires. Substance use and depressive symptoms were positively associated with prior suicide attempts. A significant three-way interaction revealed that substance use interacted with both PTSS and depressive symptoms to increase the odds of attempted suicide. Results underscore the importance of integrating substance use components into PTSD/depression treatment to reduce suicide risk in LGB youth.

AB There are more firearms in Northern Finland as compared to Southern Finland, and a positive association between suicide rates and the number of firearms in a given region has been demonstrated in previous literature. Accordingly, the authors compared firearm suicide rates of Finnish adolescent (under 18 years) males in the two geographic regions. Young adult (18-24 years) and adult (25-44 years) males were used as reference groups. National data on cases of suicide in Northern and Southern Finland between 1972 and 2009 were obtained from Statistics Finland. Firearm suicides (n = 5,423) were extracted according to ICD-classification (ICD-8/9: E955, ICD-10: X72-X75). The distribution of types of firearms (hunting gun, handgun, other) employed in suicides was also investigated. The adolescent male firearm suicide rate in Northern Finland was almost three times higher than that observed in Southern Finland, while there was no difference in rates of suicide by other methods. A northern excess in firearm suicide rates was also found among young adult and adult males. Hunting guns were the most common type of firearms employed in young male suicides, and their use was especially common in Northern Finland. Our results indicate that the use of firearms plays a major role in explaining the northern excess in young Finnish male suicide rates, and emphasize a need to advance suicide prevention according to specific regional characteristics.

TI Domestic Homicide and Homicide-Suicide: The Older Offender

AB The importance of clarifying the features characteristic of older homicide offenders is highlighted by recent research that indicates an increase in rates of homicides followed by suicides of older perpetrators. In a retrospective study of data from coroners' files on domestic homicides involving individuals killed by an older spouse or family member (65+ years of age) over a 15-year period in Quebec, Canada, we identified several specific offender and victim characteristics and circumstances surrounding the offenses. The homicide was frequently followed by the suicide of the perpetrator. Several victims had pre-existing medical illnesses, indicating that the offenses may have been committed by individuals who were caregivers to chronically ill spouses. At the time of the offense, most of the perpetrators had a mental illness, usually depressive disorder, but few had received psychiatric help. The impact of mental illness on domestic homicide-suicide is indicated, underscoring the importance of identifying existing psychopathology.

AB The objectives of this study were to generate precise estimates of suicide rates in the military while controlling for factors contributing to rate variability such as demographic differences and classification bias, and to develop a simple methodology for the determination of statistically derived thresholds for detecting significant rate changes. Suicide rate estimates were calculated for the military population and each service branch over 11 years, directly standardized to the 2000 U.S. population. Military rates were highly comparable across branches and were approximately 20% lower than the civilian rate. Direct adjustment essentially controlled for the demographic confounds in this sample. Applying the Poisson-based method, we demonstrate that suicide rate fluctuations as large as 20-40% in any year may be attributed to random error.

AB Among older adults, suicide is a significant and persistent health problem. The highest suicide rate is found among white men aged 65 years and older. The causes of elder suicide are multifaceted. Although no predominate factor precipitates or explains geriatric suicide, alcohol is strongly linked to suicide attempts and completions. This study examined the relationship between rates of suicide in 65- to 74-year-olds and per capita consumption of alcoholic beverages in European countries. Data on suicide rates in 65- to 74-year-olds and per capita consumption of alcoholic beverages were obtained from the World Health Organization databases. Correlations were computed to examine relationships between suicide rates in 65- to 74-year-old males and females and per capita consumption of beer, wine, and spirits in the general population in 34 European countries. There was a positive correlation between suicide rates in 65- to 74-year-old males and per capita consumption of spirits. No correlations between suicide rates in 65- to 74-year-old males and per capita consumption of beer or wine were found. We also found no correlations between rates of suicide in 65- to 74-year-old females and per capita consumption of beer, wine, or spirits. The results of this study are consistent with reports that consumption of spirits is associated with suicide events. It is to be hoped that this paper will stimulate further studies that are necessary to clarify the relation between suicide rates in different age groups and consumption of alcoholic beverages, and attract more attention to the problem of geriatric suicide.

AB This study applied the recently developed asymmetric causality test and asymmetric generalised impulse-response method to demonstrate the dynamic relationship between unemployment and suicide rates in the U.S. over the period of 1928-2013. The results suggest that there exist asymmetric effects of unemployment on suicide rates. An economic recession (in terms of an increase in unemployment rate) is more likely to increase the suicide rate among an old age group (55-64 years old) than among other age groups, while an economic expansion (in terms of a decrease in unemployment rate) is more likely to reduce the suicide rate of young (15-24 and 25-34 years old) and middle age groups (35-44 and 45-54 years old) than their counterpart. Therefore, policy implications generated from our results include the following: that intervention to prevent suicidal behaviour should be directed more towards the older age group during economic recession and that we may expect that an economic expansion may not result in a great reduction of suicide rates for the old age (55-64 years) group.

AB Suicide rates within the military have continued to rise in recent years, resulting in re-doubled efforts to understand and remedy this trend. In an attempt to clarify unique pathways to suicide risk in this population, the current study examined the relationship between length of time since most recent deployment and several suicide risk factors (hopelessness, suicidal ideation, and resolved plans and preparations). Furthermore, this study examined the moderating influence of post-deployment social support in the prediction of suicide risk. Results indicated that the interaction of time since deployment and post-deployment support predicted both hopelessness and resolved plans and preparations, but did not predict suicidal ideation. These findings suggest that the negative effects of time spent away from recognized military support may be compounded by the isolating effect of decreased access to alternative supports at home, resulting in increased hopelessness and/or resolved plans and preparations. Implications for the necessity of improved post-deployment programs are discussed.

AB The main objective was to identify distinct patterns of suicidal behaviors over the life course from adolescence to young adulthood and to determine influences of religiosity and other contextual factors on subgroup membership. Semiparametric growth mixture models were used to identify distinct clusters of suicide ideation and suicide attempt trajectories, and generalized estimating equations were used to assess individual and contextual characteristics predicting suicidal behaviors in adolescence and in young adulthood. Distinct trajectories of suicide ideation and suicide attempt were identified for the total sample and for the gender groups. Results showed marked gender differences in the trajectory of suicide ideation and attempt patterns. Religiosity effects on suicidality were prominent in adolescence but not in young adulthood. Analysis showed that an important window of opportunity for preventing the escalation of suicidality exists during the early adolescent period, an opportunity that should be emphasized in interventions on adolescence suicide prevention.

AB We analyzed data from the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) database for the years 2008 to 2013 to characterize deliberate self-harm among children and adolescents presenting to an emergency department (ED) in the United States. All ED visits for patients aged 19 years or younger involving any self-inflicted injuries were selected. We identified 594 658 ED visits involving self-harm. The majority of patients were female (65.8%), and between ages 16 and 19 years (62.6%). Most were treated and released from the ED (44.9%). The most common mechanisms involved injury by cutting/piercing instruments (26.4%) or poisoning by analgesics or antipyretics (21.5%). There was decrease in ED visits involving 16 to 19 year olds (-8%), and an increase in visits involving 13 to 15 year olds (+45%), 11 to 12 year olds (+94%), and 10 year olds or younger (16%). Our findings highlight a new vulnerable younger population at risk for self-inflicted injuries.

AB Utilization of health care services has been found to differ between psychiatric disorders. However, the pattern of health care contacts among suicide attempters with mental disorders is not known. This study systematically investigated the pattern of health care contacts among suicide attempters with schizophrenia spectrum versus mood disorders with or without comorbid substance use disorders both before and after attempted suicide. All consecutive medically treated suicide attempters in Helsinki from January 15, 1997, to January 14, 1998, were identified (n = 1,198). Data were gathered on all their health care contacts within the 12 months before and after the index attempt. Whereas the clear majority of all suicide attempters with schizophrenia spectrum or mood disorders had a treatment contact during the 30 days following the attempt, half of those with pure substance use disorders were without any contact with health care. Comorbid substance use made treatment less likely after attempted suicide among both psychiatric disorder groups; those with schizophrenia spectrum and comorbid substance use disorders were seven times more often left without aftercare recommendation than those without substance use comorbidity. Comorbid substance use disorders among suicide attempters with schizophrenia spectrum disorders decrease the likelihood of active aftercare, despite high suicide risk.

ID UNITED-STATES; LETHALITY; RISK
AB Study objective: We examine how method-specific case fatality rates for suicide differ by age and sex.
   Methods: Seven northeastern states provided mortality and hospital discharge data (1996 to 2000). Suicide acts were divided into 8 categories according to the method used. For each method, the fraction of acts resulting in death (the method-specific case fatality rate) was calculated. Only suicide acts that resulted in hospitalization or death were included.
   Results: Overall, 13% of all suicide acts proved lethal (23% for males compared with 5% for females; 7% for people aged 15 to 24 years compared with 34% for individuals aged greater than or equal to65 years). Poisoning with drugs accounted for 74% of acts but only 14% of fatalities; firearms and hanging accounted for only 10% of acts but 67% of fatalities. Firearms were the most lethal means (91% resulted in death), followed by drowning (84%) and hanging (82%). For every means, method-specific case fatality rates were higher for male victims and older individuals. Age and sex were associated with overall case fatality rates primarily because of their association with the distribution of methods chosen.
   Conclusion: Our findings are based on suicide acts that result in hospitalization or death and therefore underestimate the actual incidence of suicide acts and overestimate case fatality rates. Nevertheless, we find that age and sex influence overall case fatality rates primarily through their association with methods used, rather than because of variation in method-specific case fatality rates.

AB This knowledge synthesis provides an overview of published studies on the attitudes of mental health workers towards euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. A search of the Medline, PsycInfo, and Embase databases located eleven articles that met the inclusion criteria and form the basis of this review. The results show that mental health workers generally have positive attitudes towards euthanasia and assisted suicide, with slightly more favorable attitudes toward physician-assisted suicide than toward euthanasia. Several studies showed a negative correlation between religious commitment and attitudes toward euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, as well as a negative correlation reflecting experience with professionals. The relationship between attitudes and other personal characteristics (e.g., gender, age, education) is not consistent across studies. Specific methodological issues must be considered in interpreting the results, including differences in the definitions and terminology used, as well as in the way questions are formulated. The link between personal experiences and attitudes toward euthanasia or assisted suicide should be the subject of future research.

AB There is an intuitive appeal to the notion that the more lethal the weaponry the more lethal the violence. We explore one aspect of lethal weaponry, firearm accessibility. Using nation-level (N = 168) data from the Small Arms Survey and the World Health Organization's measures of mortality we examine whether rates of small arm ownership have a positive effect on rates of homicide and suicide. Contrary to the opportunity model, the accessibility of firearms does not produce more homicide or suicide when other known factors are controlled for. Consistent with past research, structural factors, like deprivation, explain a large portion of the cross-national variation in homicide and suicide, with some interesting differences between the two models. We discuss explanations for our findings and suggest that firearm accessibility may make some structural positions more lethal.

ID ACTIVITY RECOGNITION; PSYCHIATRIC-SERVICES; SUICIDE
AB In the United States, there are more than 35, 000 reported suicides with approximately 1, 800 of them being psychiatric inpatients. Staff perform intermittent or continuous observations in order to prevent such tragedies, but a study of 98 articles over time showed that 20% to 62% of suicides happened while inpatients were on an observation schedule. Reducing the instances of suicides of inpatients is a problem of critical importance to both patients and healthcare providers. In this paper, we introduce SHARE - A Self-Harm Activity Recognition Engine, which attempts to infer self-harming activities from sensing accelerometer data using smart devices worn on a subject's wrist. Preliminary classification accuracy of 80% was achieved using data acquired from 4 subjects performing a series of activities (both self-harming and not). The results, application, and proposed technology platform are discussed in-depth.

AB The capability for suicide is posited to facilitate the relatively rare transition from suicidal ideation to suicidal behavior, although the operational definition of the construct continues to evolve. The Three Step Theory proposes that capability is multifaceted and includes practical capability for suicide, defined as comfort with and access to lethal means. Empirical examinations of this construct are thus far limited. Two previous studies have examined the association between firearm storage and shooting experience and common measures of capability for suicide. This study expands the generalizability of previous findings by investigating the relationship between capability for suicide, firearm storage practices, and experience shooting a firearm in a sample of 300 American firearm owners. We found that individuals who store their firearms unsafely (loaded, in a non-secure 4 location, or without a locking device) and who have greater experience shooting firearms have significantly higher capability for suicide. These findings extend the evidence for the construct of practical capability as it relates to firearms and highlight the need for firearm-specific means safety measures to prevent suicide.

AB In this study, we examined the relationship between familism and family environment type as well as the relationship between family environment type and suicide attempts among Latina youth. Latina teen attempters (n = 109) and nonattempters (n = 107) were recruited from the New York City area. Latent class analysis revealed three family environment types: tight-knit, intermediate-knit, and loose-knit. Tight-knit families (high cohesion and low conflict) were significantly less likely to have teens who attempted suicide as compared with intermediate-knit families or loose-knit families. Moreover, familism increased the odds of being in a tight-knit family versus a loose-knit family and the odds of being in a tight-knit family versus a intermediate-knit. The results suggest that familism may protect against suicide behavior among Latinas via its influence on family environment.

AB Despite evidence of considerable racial/ethnic variation in adolescent suicidal behavior in the United States, research on youth of European American descent accounts for much of what is know about preventing adolescent suicide. In response to the need to advance research on the phenomenology and prevention of suicidal behavior among ethnic minority populations, NIMH co-sponsored the "Pragmatic Considerations of Culture in Preventing Suicide" workshop to elicit through interdisciplinary dialogue how culture can be considered in the design, development, and implementation of suicidal behavior prevention programs. In this discussion paper we consider the three ethnic minority suicide prevention efforts described in the articles appearing in this issue, along with workshop participants' comments, and propose six major areas where issues of culture need to be better integrated into suicidal behavior research.

AB This study investigates suicidality and health-risk behaviors among female juvenile detainees and identifies the extent to which suicidal behaviors are correlated with other risky activities. This study also explores 12 health risk behaviors, their prevalence, and relative associations to suicidal behaviors within the sample-population. Researchers collected data from 104 female adolescents, ages 12 to 20, residing in a long-term, detention center in the southeastern region of the United States. Descriptive statistics and regression analysis were utilized. Suicidal ideations (40%) and suicide attempts (34%) were highly prevalent among female juvenile detainees. Results also suggest that the persistence of suicidal ideations was significantly influenced by exposure to various forms of interpersonal violence. Despite increased exposure to psychosocial factors strongly correlated to suicidal and high risk behaviors, little attention has been given to this particular population. Research recommendations are also discussed.

AB The world-wide annual suicide rate currently averages approximately 13/100,000 (0.013%/year), with higher average rates for men than women in all but a few countries, very low rates in children, and relatively high rates in elderly men Suicide rates vary markedly among regions of the world, countries, and locales, in part reflecting differences in case-identification and reporting procedures. Rates of attempted suicide average 20-30 times higher than rates of completed suicide in the general population, but are probably under-reported A highly controversial question is whether antidepressant treatment modifies the risks of various aspects of "suicidality" among patients with major depressive disorders. Research on the relationship between pharmacotherapy and suicidal behavior was virtually unknown until a decade ago. A minority of ecological studies and most large clinical studies have found that decreases of suicide rates by region or time are correlated with higher rates of prescribing modern antidepressants. However, other studies and data from brief, randomized, controlled trials in patients with acute major depression have found increases for patients of some ages, particularly for the risk of suicide attempts, as well as increases in suicidal ideation in the young. Although other pharmacological treatments, such as clozapine and lithium, appear to have sound evidence for reducing the risk of attempted and completed suicide, in this paper we proposed to analyze the relationship between suicidality in depressed adults and only antidepressants.

AB Background: The suicide case-fatality rate (CFR)-the proportion of suicidal acts that are fatal-depends on the distribution of methods used in suicidal acts and the probability of death given a particular method (method-specific CFR).
   Objective: To estimate overall and method-specific suicide CFRs and the distribution of methods used in suicidal acts by demographic characteristics.
   Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Setting: United States, 2007 to 2014.
   Participants: Suicide deaths (n = 309 377 records from the National Vital Statistics System) and nonfatal suicide attempts requiring treatment in an emergency department (ED) (n = 1 791 638 records from the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample) or hospitalization (n = 1 556 871 records from the National [Nationwide] Inpatient Sample) among persons aged 5 years or older.
   Measurements: Rates of suicide deaths and nonfatal suicide attempts, overall and method-specific CFRs, and distribution of methods used, by sex, age group, region, and urbanization.
   Results: Overall, 8.5% of suicidal acts were fatal (14.7% for males vs. 3.3% for females; 3.4% for persons aged 15 to 24 years vs. 35.4% for those aged >= 65 years). Drug poisoning accounted for 59.4% of acts but only 13.5% of deaths; firearms and hanging accounted for only 8.8% of acts but 75.3% of deaths. Firearms were the most lethal method (89.6% of suicidal acts with a firearm resulted in death), followed by drowning (56.4%) and hanging (52.7%). Method-specific CFRs were higher for males and older persons. The distribution of methods varied across demographic groups.
   Limitations: Results are based on suicidal acts resulting in an ED visit, a hospitalization, or death. Consequently, the reported CFRs are larger than they would have been had the data included nonfatal attempts that did not result in an ED visit.
   Conclusion: Variation in overall suicide CFR between sexes and across age groups, regions, and urbanization is largely explained by the distribution of methods used in suicidal acts.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine psychological, substance use, and sociodemographic predictors of 12-month suicide ideation and attempts across six US racial/ethnic groups-white, Latino/a, Black, Asian or Pacific Islander (A/PI), American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN), and multiracial adults. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted for 218,765 adults who participated in the 2008-2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Overall, commonly cited factors were associated with increased risk for suicide ideation and attempt for some racial/ethnic groups, but not for others. As one example, 12-month depression was associated with 12-month suicide attempt for A/PI, AI/AN, Latino/a, and white, but not for Black or multiracial adults. Alcohol abuse and dependence were also associated with suicide attempt for AI/AN, Black, and white respondents but not for other racial/ethnic groups. Risk factors for suicide ideation and attempt may not increase risk universally. More theoretically supported research is needed.

AB The current study examined characteristics of bullying involvement and social connectedness in relation to suicide ideation and attempts in a sample of youth who report bully victimization, bully perpetration, and/or low social connectedness. The sample was comprised of 321 youth (67% female), ages 12-15 years (M = 13.6), recruited from an emergency department in the Midwest region of the United States. Results indicated that lower levels of social connectedness and higher levels of bully victimization and perpetration were significantly associated with suicide ideation and attempts. Level of social connectedness did not moderate the relationship between bullying involvement and suicide risk. The associations between the severity of subtypes of bully victimization and perpetration (verbal, relational, physical), electronic bullying involvement, and suicide risk were examined. Results highlight a continuum in severity of bullying involvement and social connectedness associated with suicide risk. Implications of these results are discussed.

AB Suicide is currently the second leading cause of death in the U.S. military. Little recent research has been done on a well-defined cohort at high risk for death by suicide, which consist of military patients who attempt suicide or are admitted for suicidal ideation. As a pilot investigation based on a literature review of suicidal behavior in the U.S. military, 100 consecutive charts of suicidal patients at a tertiary military treatment facility were reviewed. The findings included the following: 94% were admitted with a depressed mood; 67% had a history of previous attempts or gestures; 49% had been treated with psychiatric medication prior to admission and 88% were treated with psychiatric medications while on the ward; 47% returned to a full duty status; 29% were recommended for administrative separation; and 18% were recommended for a medical board. Suggestions for future research are presented to help improve our suicide prevention programs.

AB Objectives. To describe trends in suicides with opioid poisoning noted as a contributing cause of death.
   Methods. Using National Vital Statistics data (1999-2014), we calculated age-adjusted rates of suicide with opioid poisoning (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes T40.0-T40.4) per 100 000 population per year and annual percentage change (APC) in rates. We used Joinpoint regression to examine trends in suicide rates and proportion of suicides involving opioids.
   Results. The annual age-adjusted death rate from suicide with opioid poisoning as a contributing cause of death increased from 0.3 per 100 000 in 1999 to 0.7 per 100 000 in 2009 (APC = 8.1%; P <.001), and remained at 0.6 to 0.7 per 100 000 through 2014. The percentage of all suicides with opioid poisoning listed as a contributing cause of death increased from 2.2% in 1999 to 4.4% in 2010 (P <.001). Rates were similar for men and women, higher among Whites than non-Whites, higher in the West, and highest for individuals aged 45 to 64 years.
   Conclusions. Opioid involvement in suicides has doubled since 1999. These analyses underscore the need for health care providers to assess suicidal risk in patients receiving opioids.

   18-MONTH TRIAL; MOOD DISORDERS; UNITED-STATES; ANTIDEPRESSANT TREATMENT;

AB Bipolar disorders are prevalent, often severe, and disabling illnesses with elevated lethality largely due to suicide. Suicide rates average similar to 1% annually, or perhaps 60 times higher than the international population rate of 0.015% annually. Suicidal acts typically occur early in bipolar disorders and in association with severe depressive or mixed states. The high lethality of suicidal acts in bipolar disorders is suggested by a much lower ratio of attempts:suicide (similar to 3:1) than in the general population (similar to 30:1). Risk factors can help to identify patients at increased suicidal risk, but ongoing clinical assessment is essential to limit risk. Empirical short-term interventions to manage acute suicidal risk include close clinical supervision, rapid hospitalization, and electroconvulsive therapy. Remarkably, however, evidence of the long-term effectiveness of most treatments against suicidal behavior is rare. A notable exception is lithium prophylaxis, which is associated with consistent evidence of major (similar to 80%), sustained relative reductions of risk of suicides and attempts, and lower lethality (increased attempts:suicide ratio). Such benefits are unproved for other treatments commonly used to treat bipolar disorder patients, including anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, antidepressants, and psychosocial interventions. Applying available knowledge systematically, with close and sustained clinical supervision, can enhance management of suicidal risk in bipolar disorders patients.

AB Background: With the exception of the United States, in recent years suicide rates have been declining in most western countries. Notoriously, suicide rates fluctuate - especially in males - in response to a range of socio-political and environmental factors, some of them difficult to identify. Our aim was to obtain an updated profile of main commonalities in suicide cases of Queensland residents between 2002 and 2011 to inform prevention strategies.
   Methods: Data were obtained from the Queensland Suicide Register (QSR), including police and toxicology reports, post-mortem autopsy and Coroner's findings. Data are crosschecked with records from the National Coronial Information System. Age-standardised rates (ASR) of suicide, Poisson regression and Chi(2) tests are presented.
   Results: A total of 5752 suicides by Queensland residents was registered between 2002 and 2011; 76.9% by males and 23.1% by females. The average ASR was 14.3 per 100,000, with a significant decrease between 2002 and 2011. Rates declined significantly in males, not in females. On average, rates were 3.41-times higher in males. ASR for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples was significantly higher than for other Australians. Overall, male suicide rates were particularly high in remote areas, as well as in the most disadvantaged ones. One third of suicide cases presented history of previous suicidal behaviour, and half a detected and treated mental disorder. Hanging was the most common method.
   Conclusions: Suicide rates have declined in Queensland, Australia. It is problematic to say if this was due to suicide prevention programs or other factors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Our study was designed to explore additional outcome variables of a suicide case-control study to determine the association between sexual orientation and gender identity in suicide completion in children and adolescents.
   Method: Fifty-five child and adolescent suicide victims and 55 community control subjects were assessed using semi-structured, proxy-based interviews and questionnaires regarding sexual orientation and gender issues, psychopathological diagnoses, and service use.
   Results: In our sample, no significant differences between suicide victims and control subjects were found regarding same-sex sexual orientation nor intimidation related to same-sex sexual orientation. Suicide victims with same-sex sexual orientation were more likely than suicide victims without same-sex sexual orientation, to meet criteria for anxiety disorders. Within the month preceding their deaths, these youth were more likely to have consulted a health professional, a psychiatrist, as well as having been hospitalized, and were more likely to have consulted a psychiatrist in the last year.
   Conclusions: In our sample, same-sex sexual orientation and gender identity issues do not appear to be more prevalent among youth who die by suicide, compared with youth recruited from the general population, nor for same-sex sexual-related intimidation. While exhibiting comparable levels of general psychopathological diagnoses associated with suicide, suicide victims with same-sex sexual orientation were more likely to meet criteria for anxiety disorders and to have consulted mental health professionals before their deaths.

AB The present study reports the multistage development and evaluation of a Spanish translation of the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (INQ). The INQ measures the constructs of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness, which the interpersonal theory of suicide proposes are proximal causes of suicidal desire. Participants were bilingual Hispanic college students in the United States (n = 56), heritage Spanish-speaking college students in the United States (n = 281), college students in Spain (n = 1,016), psychiatric inpatients in Mexico (n = 181), college students in Mexico (n = 239), and Spanish-speaking U.S. adults (n = 104). Results indicated that a 9-item 2-factor solution (INQ-S-9) provided good fit. Multiple group analyses were also consistent with measurement invariance across nationalities and clinical severity. Finally, both subscale scores demonstrated good internal consistency, test-retest reliability, convergent validity, and concurrent associations with scores on measures of suicide ideation. Cultural considerations and implications for use in clinical and research settings are discussed.
   Public Significance Statement
   The present study provides a 9-item Spanish-language version of the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire to promote research on perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness-two robust suicide risk factors-among Hispanic populations. The study details the translation process as well as the factor structure, measurement invariance, reliability, construct validity, and criterion validity of the measure.

AB Objective Youth suicide is a public health problem in the United States. Suicide prevention programs have been shown to be beneficial; however, knowledge of unanticipated adverse consequences of programs is limited. The objective of this review is to present what is known about these consequences so informed decisions and appropriate planning can be made prior to implementation of suicide prevention interventions. Method A narrative but systematic review was conducted assessing what is known about adverse consequences utilizing a comprehensive keyword search of EBSCO and PubMed databases. Study populations beyond youth were included. Results Unanticipated adverse consequences of suicide prevention interventions were included in 22 publications. Consequences occur at three levels: at the level of the youth, those who identify or intervene with at-risk youth, and at the system level. While rare, unanticipated adverse consequences include an increase in maladaptive coping and a decrease in help-seeking among program targets, overburden or increased suicide ideation among program implementers, and inadequate systemic preparedness. Conclusions Overall, the benefits of youth suicide prevention outweigh the unanticipated adverse consequences. Nevertheless, these results may be utilized for informed decision-making regarding suicide prevention programming, and to ensure appropriate infrastructure is in place prior to prevention efforts.

AB Background: Over the last decade, suicide rates in the U.S. military have steadily increased, resulting in a call for suicide-related research with military populations. The present project aimed to describe and evaluate the communications (i.e., verbally and in suicide notes) of 13 suicide risk factors in the suicide death investigation files of 98 active duty U.S. Air Force (USAF) members.
   Methods: Two-hundred thirty-seven suicide death investigation files were coded. Ninety-eight decedents left suicide notes and were included in the current analyses. Descriptive statistics were computed to evaluate the types of risk factors most commonly communicated prior to and at the time of death as well as the medium for their communication. Specifically, verbal and note communications were compared to evaluate which medium decedents most often used to communicate risk factors. Also, the frequency that interpersonal compared to intrapsychic risk factors were communicated was evaluated.
   Results: Hopelessness (35.7% of cases) and perceived burdensomeness (31.6% of cases) were the risk factors most often communicated in suicide notes but not verbally. Thwarted belongingness (29.6% of cases) was the risk factor most often communicated verbally and in the suicide note. Further, evaluated risk factors were more frequently communicated in suicide notes than verbally. Finally, interpersonal risk factors were more often communicated than intrapsychic risk factors.
   Limitations: The validity of the data relies on interviews of decedents' acquaintances and various medical/military records.
   Conclusions: Our findings support emphasizing certain risk factors over others in USAF suicide prevention efforts. Further, interpersonal risk factors appeared to be more salient than intrapsychic risk factors in the minds of decedents. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: This study was to explore the relation between psychological strains and suicidal ideation among Chinese and American college students. Another secondary purpose of the study was to examine the reliability of the psychological strains scales (PPS: Ref) one more time in China and the United States in college populations.
   Method: Samples of college students were randomly recruited from China and United States. All of 529 college students (aged 17-27, 68.9% female) completed self-report assessments of psychological strains (Psychological Strain Scale), suicidal ideation (Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation), and indicators of psychological well-being (e.g., depression, anxiety, and stress).
   Results: Empirical results show that Psychological Strain Scales (PSS) has a good reliability. Chinese college students reported higher suicide ideation scores than American students whereas there was no statistical difference in psychological strains. Psychological strains and, depression, anxiety, and stress, were positively related to suicidal ideation in both countries. Stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that psychological strain can significantly predict suicidal ideation.
   Conclusions: These findings provide support for the Strain Theory of Suicide for both Chinese and American college students and some measures can be taken to reduce psychological strains in students. However, future work could extend these findings by utilizing a longitudinal design to determine whether psychological strains are in fact antecedents, and not simply correlates, of suicide ideation.

AB Background: Suicide-bereaved individuals represent an important group impacted by suicide. Understanding their experiences following the suicide of a loved one is an important research domain, despite receiving limited attention. Although suicide-bereaved individuals may benefit from mental health treatment, their attitudes toward therapy and therapists are poorly understood. Aims: The present study aimed to understand the extent to which bereaved individuals' attitudes toward therapy and therapists are impacted by whether their loved one was in therapy at the time of death. Method: Suicide-bereaved individuals (N = 243) from the United States were recruited to complete an online survey about their experience with and attitudes toward therapy and therapists following the suicide of a loved one. Results: Bereaved individuals whose loved one was in therapy at the time of death (N = 48, 19.8%) reported more negative and less positive attitudes toward the treating therapist than those whose loved one was not in therapy at the time of death (N = 81, 33.3%) or whose loved one was never in therapy/the deceased's therapy status was unknown (N = 114, 46.9%). Conclusion: The deceased's involvement with a therapist appears to be an important factor impacting the experience of bereaved individuals and should be considered when attempting to engage these individuals in postvention.

AB Background: Pesticide self-poisoning is the most commonly used suicide method worldwide, but few studies have investigated the national epidemiology of pesticide suicide in countries where it is a major public health problem. This study aims to investigate geographic variations in pesticide suicide and their impact on the spatial distribution of suicide in Taiwan.
   Methods: Smoothed standardized mortality ratios for pesticide suicide (2002-2009) were mapped across Taiwan's 358 districts (median population aged 15 or above = 27 000), and their associations with the size of agricultural workforce were investigated using Bayesian hierarchical models.
   Results: In 2002-2009 pesticide poisoning was the third most common suicide method in Taiwan, accounting for 13.6% (4913/36 110) of all suicides. Rates were higher in agricultural East and Central Taiwan and lower in major cities. Almost half (47%) of all pesticide suicides occurred in areas where only 13% of Taiwan's population lived. The geographic distribution of overall suicides was more similar to that of pesticide suicides than non-pesticide suicides. Rural-urban differences in suicide were mostly due to pesticide suicide. Areas where a higher proportion of people worked in agriculture showed higher pesticide suicide rates (adjusted rate ratio [ARR] per standard deviation increase in the proportion of agricultural workers = 1.58, 95% Credible Interval [CrI] 1.44-1.74) and overall suicide rates (ARR = 1.06, 95% CrI 1.03-1.10) but lower non-pesticide suicide rates (ARR = 0.91, 95% CrI 0.87-0.95).
   Conclusion: Easy access to pesticides appears to influence the geographic distribution of suicide in Taiwan, highlighting the potential benefits of targeted prevention strategies such as restricting access to highly toxic pesticides.

AB Investigators from a number of countries have linked temporal declines in the rate of completed suicide in children and adults to the increasing utilization of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. They suggest that the relationship is causal. We undertook a thorough literature search of the rates of completed suicide using data from 1980 onwards, from the World Health Organization, the US National Center for Health Statistics, and related studies, in order to ascertain if a broad array of epidemiological evidence would or would not support a consistent association between suicide completion and SSRI utilization. The major findings were: (1) within and between countries, suicide rates vary prominently by age group; (2) national differences are marked with respect to a temporal association between rates of completed suicide and SSRI utilization; (3) in nearly half of the countries of the world, the decline in the suicide rate preceded the onset of the use of SSRIs; (4) suicide rates have fluctuated dramatically over the last century; and (5) the association between declining rates of completed suicides and increased SSRI use in the USA between 1990 and 1999 was no longer present between 2000 and 2004. We conclude that available ecological evidence does not support an inverse temporal relationship between rates of completed suicide and SSRI utilization.

AB A scale to measure attitudes toward physician assisted suicide was administered to a sample (N = 246) of Polish citizens and a sample (N = 246) of U.S. citizens equated on gender, marital status, religion, and socioeconomic level. In both samples the reliability was substantial (Cronbach's alphas of .93 and .89), and the factor structure identical (one major factor). Significant ethnic differences were found for 10 of the 12 scale items, but no differences related to demographic variables. The obtained differences appear to parallel a conservative-liberal dimension, though this will need to be assessed in future studies.

AB Suicide rates vary among racel- and age-defined groups, yet little is known about how Suicide risk factors differentially impact individual groups. This study assessed differential associations of socioeconomic status among age- and race-defined groups Of suicide victims. A database containing demographic information on declared suicides in Fulton County, GA, from 1 January 1988 through 31 December 2003 was combined with annual per capita income by zip code in Atlanta, GA. Analyses were performed to evaluate differential associations of socioeconomic status among age- and race-defined groups Of Suicide victims. Compared with the respective ethnic Populations of Fulton County, white Suicide victims lived in areas with lower per capita income ($51,232 vs. $35,893); African American suicide victims did not (S 17,384 vs. S 18,179). Elderly Suicide victims (>= 65 years) were more likely to live in the lowest per capita income areas compared with other age groups (OR 1.80, 95% C.I. 1.14, 2.84). Cox proportional hazards models showed increasing income increased the instantaneous risk of suicide among adolescents (HR 2.76; 95% C.I. 2.15, 3.53), particularly African American adolescents (FIR 4.22; 95% C.I. 2.19, 8.11), and decreased risk among the elderly (HR 0.58; 95% C.I. 0.50, 0.68). Socioeconomic status had differential associations among age- and race-defined groups of suicide victims. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Nurse practitioners have the power to assess psychosocial risk and detect and prevent suicide, a problem plaguing rural areas of the United States. Suicide risk assessment can be completed using the Home, Education, Activities, Drug use and abuse, Sexual behavior, and Suicidality and depression (HEADSS) interview instrument. The purpose of this study was to determine if HEADSS is appropriate for guiding suicide risk assessment of rural adolescents.
   Method: High school students in Southwestern Pennsylvania completed qualitative questions from the Child Behavior Checklist and Coping Response Inventory as part of the Intervention to Promote Mental Health in Rural Youth. Qualitative content analysis was performed.
   Results: Prominent themes identified by participants included academic performance, relationships, dislikes about school, friends, death, mental health, and the future. Several minor themes concerned safety. Most known risk factors for suicide were concerns of participants.
   Discussion: The expansion of HEADSS to include death and safety should be considered. The modified version-HEADDSSS-can be used to guide suicide risk assessment of youth in rural Pennsylvania, ensuring both thoroughness of assessment and safety. J Pediatr Health Care. (2010) 24, 152-167.

AB In countries/states where voluntary euthanasia (VE) or physician-assisted suicide (PAS) is legal, the patient's decision about whether to request VE or PAS heavily relies on the information others provide. We use the tools of microeconomic theory to study how communication between the patient, his family and his physician influences the patient's decision. We argue that families have considerable power over the patient and that the amount of information that is transmitted from physician to patient might be severely diminished as a result of legalizing VE or PAS. We discuss our main results in the context of the ongoing normative debate over the legalization of VE and PAS. (JEL D8, I12)

AB Objectives To test, among older Chinese adolescents, the associations of childhood maltreatment with single and multiple suicide attempts and whether these associations vary in relation to the presence of sleep disturbance.
   Study design We analyzed data collected from 10th to 12th graders from 7 randomly selected provinces of China in the 2015 School-based Chinese Adolescents Health Survey. There were 83 200 students who were invited to participate. and 75 715 students' questionnaires were completed and qualified for the survey. Adjusted multinomial logistic regression models were conducted to evaluate the associations of childhood maltreatment with suicide attempts.
   Results Compared with no suicide attempts, each type of adjusted childhood maltreatment (physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect, or emotional neglect) was associated with an increased risk of single and multiple suicide attempts (P < .05). The magnitude of the aORs in multiple suicide attempters was greater than those in single suicide attempters. Moreover, the adjusted interaction effects for a single suicide attempt between each type of childhood maltreatment and sleep disturbance were all statistically significant in the multivariable multinomial logistic regression models (P < .001). However, the adjusted interaction effects for multiple suicide attempts were not significant (P > .05).
   Conclusions Maltreatment during one's childhood is associated with an increased risk of single and multiple suicide attempts among older Chinese adolescents. Sleep disturbances play a moderating role in these associations for a single suicide attempt.

AB Purpose: To provide the first national description of death in juvenile justice residential facilities.
   Methods: Data come from recent censuses of all public and private juvenile justice facilities in the United States. Death rates for the custody population are adjusted for length at risk, and are compared to death rates of adolescents in the general population. Multivariate modeling is used to identify facility-level risk factors related to deaths.
   Results: Adjusting for the number of days at risk, adolescents in juvenile justice facilities have lower risks of death by accident and homicide, but considerably higher risks of death from suicide and illness (200% and 50%, respectively). Facilities with larger Black populations, those that lock sleeping room doors, and facilities designed to screen young persons for future placements all had significantly higher odds of experiencing a death.
   Conclusions: The higher rates of death from suicide or illness suggest either (a) juvenile justice facilities host very high risk adolescents who would have died on the outside, (b) the facility environment itself increases the risk of death relative to the adolescents' environment outside the facility, particularly in the case of deaths from suicide, (c) placement in a juvenile justice facility may be indicative of a time of crisis in adolescents' lives in terms of physical or mental health and thus the risk of death increases, or most realistically, (d) some combination of the above. That deaths are more likely in facilities with larger Black populations warrants significant future investigation. Finally, the policy of locking sleeping room doors should be seriously evaluated in light of the strong association found with suicide. (c) 2006 Society for Adolescent Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB An association between antidepressant use and suicidality is currently the topic of considerable study, debate, and controversy. This has generated enormous public interest. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency have placed warnings on the use of antidepressants. In both countries only fluoxetine has been approved for use in children, while other drugs are not shown to be effective and can increase the risk of suicide in that age group. For adults use, the FDA has asked manufacturers to change the labels of 10 drugs to include stronger cautions and warnings about the need to monitor patients for the worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidal ideation, regardless of the cause of such worsening. These drugs are bupropion, citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, mirtazapine, nefazodone, paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram and venlafaxine. Moreover, on October 15, 2004, the FDA directed the manufacturers of all antidepressants to add a "black box" warning that describes the increased risk of suicidality in children and adolescents given antidepressant medications and notes what uses the drugs have been approved or not been approved for in these patients. Antidepressants should no longer be associated with the terms "cosmetic psychopharmacology" and "lifestyle drugs". This is a medically necessary treatment that requires expertise and close monitoring. It should be kept in mind however that the greatest cause of suicide is not antidepressant use, but untreated depression. Over 50% of all suicides, including over 70% of suicides in children are caused by depression. At autopsy, less than 20% of suicide cases have measurable antidepressant in postmortem toxicology testing. Because most suicide victims suffer from major depression and commit suicide as a result of untreated or inadequately treated depression, suicide prevention in depression should therefore be addressed with expert treatment.

AB Objective To assess the association of eczema with a patient's subsequent risk of death from suicide. We hypothesised that persistent eczema would be associated with an increased risk for death from suicide.
   Design Double matched case-control study.
   Setting General population of Ontario, Canada.
   Participants Patients 15-55 years old. We identified cases of suicide from coroners' reports between 1 January 1994 and 31 December 2014 and matched 1:2 with alive controls based on age, sex and socioeconomic status.
   Exposure The primary predictor was a history of persistent eczema, defined as five or more physician visits for the diagnosis over the preceding 5years.
   Main outcome and measure Logistic regression to estimate the association between eczema and death from suicide.
   Results We identified 18441 cases of suicide matched to 36882 controls over the 21-year accrual period. Persistent eczema occurred in 174 (0.94%) suicide cases and 285 (0.77%) controls yielding a 22% increased risk of suicide associated with persistent eczema (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.48, p=0.037). In mediation analyses, this association was largely explained through major suicide risk factors. Two-thirds of patients with eczema who died from suicide had visited a physician in the month before their death and one in eight had visited for eczema in the month before their death. Among patients who died by suicide, jumping and poisoning were relatively more frequent mechanisms among patients with eczema.
   Conclusions Patients with persistent eczema have a modestly increased subsequent risk of death from suicide, but this is not independent of overall mental health and the absolute risk is low. Physicians caring for these patients have opportunities to intervene for suicide prevention.

AB Objective Suicides among active duty US Army personnel have been increasing since 2004, surpassing comparable civilian rates in 2008. This analysis uses US military data to assess suicide rates for the 2-year period 2007-8, and examines relative risks (RR) of suicide associated with mental health disorders.
   Methods Historical trends of US Army suicides were assessed using 1977-2008 data from Army G-1 (Personnel). Suicide rates, RR and the 2000-8 trends of mental health disorders were calculated using data from the Defense Casualty Information Processing System and Defense Medical Surveillance System.
   Results A total of 255 soldiers committed suicide in 2007-8 (2008 rate 20.2 per 100 000). Factors associated with higher suicide risk included male gender, lower enlisted rank and mental health disorders treated on an outpatient basis (RR 3.9), as well as a number of mental health disorders (mood disorders, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, personality/psychotic disorders, substance-related disorders and adjustment disorder; RR range 4.7-24.5). Analysis of historical trends suggested that 25-50% of the suicides that occurred in 2008 might have been related to the major commitment of troops to combat beginning in 2003.
   Conclusions The recent increase in suicides parallels an increase in the prevalence of mental disorders across the army. This finding suggests that increasing rates of clinically treated psychopathology are associated with increasing rates of suicides; these rates probably serve as sentinels for suicide risk in this population. Soldiers seeking treatment for mental disorders and substance abuse should be a focus for suicide prevention.

AB Objectives. Reducing access to firearms as a suicide prevention strategy is limited in the US today because of divergent cultural attitudes and political contentiousness surrounding gun restrictions. This research examined the effects of culturally-specific suicide prevention messages on the likelihood of restricting firearm access during periods of suicide risk.Methods. Focus groups and key informant interviews were conducted with rural gun owners in order to develop a suicide prevention message that highlighted the importance of restricting access to firearms during periods of risk without threatening second amendment concerns. The effectiveness of this gun culture message, relative to standard suicide prevention messaging and a control condition, was then tested with a national sample of gun owners.Results. Relative to all other conditions, respondents who received our culturally-specific message in conjunction with standard suicide prevention content reported the greatest likelihood of taking steps to restrict access to firearms. This tendency was enhanced for individuals who were more politically conservative, lived in more rural areas, and supported gun rights to a stronger degree.Conclusions. Findings underscore the importance of attending to cultural factors in public health messaging. Messaging that respects the values of gun owners could hold promise in promoting firearm restriction for suicide prevention.

AB Ways of conceptualizing suicide prevention are reviewed briefly, and the preventive model: Universal, Selected, and Indicated prevention (USI) is chosen as the structure for the literature review, and the discussion. Universal preventive interventions are directed toward entire population; selective interventions are directed toward individuals who are at greater risk for suicidal behaviour; and indicated preventions are targeted at individuals who have already begun self-destructive behaviour.
   On the universal prevention level, an overview of the literature is presented with focus on restrictions in firearms and carbon monoxide gas. At the selective prevention level, a review of risk of suicide in homelessness and schizophrenia and risk factors for suicide in schizophrenia is conducted and possible interventions are mentioned together with the evidence for their effect. Suicide rate and preventive measures in affective disorder are also touched upon. At the indicated prevention level, studies of fatal and non-fatal suicide acts after suicide attempt are mentioned. The evidence of preventive measures to reduce repetition rates is presented.
   Finally, the state of the art is discussed with regard to prevention at the universal, the selected and the indicated level and clinical and research implications are outlined. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objectives. We assessed the risk of suicide among veterans compared with nonveterans.
   Methods. Cox proportional hazards models estimated the relative risk of suicide, by self-reported veteran status, among 500 822 adult male participants in the National Death Index (NDI) linked National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a nationally representative cohort study.
   Results. A total of 482 male veterans died by suicide during 1 837 886 person-years of follow-up (76% by firearm); 835 male nonveterans died by suicide during 4 438 515 person-years of follow-up (62% by firearm). Crude suicide rates for veterans and nonveterans were, respectively, 26.2 and 18.8 per 100 000 person-years. The risk of suicide was not significantly higher among veterans, compared with nonveterans, after adjustment for differences in age, race, and survey year (hazard ratio = 1.11; 95% confidence interval = 0.96, 1.29).
   Conclusions. Consistent with most studies of suicide risk among veterans of conflicts before Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom, but in contrast to a previous study using the NDI-linked NHIS data, we found that male veterans responding to the NHIS were modestly, but not significantly, at higher risk for suicide compared with male nonveterans.

AB Background: There have been conflicting findings on temporal variation in suicide risk and few have examined the phenomenon in clinical populations. The study investigated seasonal and other temporal patterns using national data.
   Methods: Data on 73,591 general population and 19,318 patient suicide deaths in England between 1997 and 2012 were collected through the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide examining suicide rates in relation to month of the year, day of the week, and individual days of national or religious significance.
   Results: Suicide incidence fell over successive months of the year and there was evidence of an overall spring peak. Monday was associated with the highest suicide rates and in the patient population this effect appeared to be more pronounced in those aged over 50 or those who lived alone. Suicide risk was significantly lower during Christmas, particularly for women. There was a peak in suicide on New Year's Day in the general population. Other 'special days' were not associated with a change in suicide incidence. Limitations: We were limited to identifying associations between the variables investigated and were unable to explore causal mechanisms. We did not carry out comprehensive multi-variable adjustment in our regression models.
   Conclusions: There is substantial seasonal and temporal variation in suicide deaths, and there appears to be some evidence in the clinical as well as the general population in England. Clinical services should be aware of the risk of suicide just after the weekend, especially in people who live alone, and the potential need for closer supervision during this period.

AB Background The availability of firearms in homes and at aggregate levels is a risk factor for suicide and homicide. One method of reducing access to suicidal means is the restriction of firearm availability through more stringent legislation.
   Aims To evaluate the impact of firearm legislation reform on firearm suicides and homicides as well as on the availability of firearms in Austria.
   Method Official statistics on suicides, firearm homicides and firearm licences issued from 1985 to 2005 were examined. To assess the effect of the new firearm law, enacted in 1997, linear regression and Poisson regressions were performed using data from before and after the law reform.
   Results The rate of firearm suicides among some age groups, percentage of firearm suicides, as well as the rate of firearm homicides and the rate of firearm licences, significantly decreased after a more stringent firearm law had been implemented.
   Conclusions Our findings provide evidence that the introduction of restrictive firearm legislation effectively reduced the rates of firearm suicide and homicide. The decline in firearm-related deaths seems to have been mediated by the legal restriction of firearm availability. Restrictive firearm legislation should be an integral part of national suicide prevention programmes in countries with high firearm suicide rates.

AB PurposeDistinctive and dramatic changes in the history of China with a rapid suicide decline in recent years present an opportunity to investigate the risk of suicide. In this study, we investigated suicide risk with a historical perspective with archived data to inform suicide research and prevention policies and strategies.MethodDocumented age-specific suicide mortality rates in 1987-2012 were decomposed into age, period, and cohort effect using APC-modeling method and intrinsic estimator (IE) technique. The estimated effects were further analyzed by numerical differentiation.ResultsThe data satisfactorily fit the constructed APC models. Cohort effect indicated that suicide risk in China fluctuated at very high levels during 1903-1967, followed by a sharp decline during 1968-1977, and reached the lowest level in 1983-1987 before increased again. Period effect confirmed the declining trend since 1987. Three sunny cohorts with reduced suicide risk and four cloudy cohorts with increased risk were, respectively, associated with significant cultural, social, political, and economic events in China since the 1900s.ConclusionsThe mega trends in the suicide risk at the population level are closely related to significant historical events in China. Suicide is anticipated to increase because of the growing risk for the young cohorts (particularly young females) as the country further develops. Study findings suggest the significance of national strategies for suicide prevention and control, including maintenance of social harmony and stability, provision of more opportunities for development, enhancement of social integration, and restriction of suicide facilitating factors.

AB Previous studies have found that primary care resources are associated with various health outcomes. The primary purpose of the study was to test for associatiorts between psychiatrist availability, social disintegration and suicide rates. Data utilized were from. the 2002 Area Resource File on U.S. counties (N = 3080). Suicide rates were averaged over 6 years covering 1990 through 1995. Poisson and Negative binomial regression models were used to assess the association of psychiatrist availability and suicide rate ratios. Availability of psychiatrists was significantly related to suicide. Counties with greater availability of psychiatrists per 10,000 experienced a 0.12% reduction. in their suicide rates (beta = -0.0012, incidence density ratio [IDR] = 0.9988, 95% CI = 0.9984-0.9992). Divorce strongly elevated suicide rates (beta = 0.0724, IDR = 1.075.1, 95% CI = 1.0664-0858). Counties with a high percentage of men 65 years or older had significantly high suicide rates. An increase in, the While population between. 1980 and 1990 was also associated with a significant increase in suicide. Increases in psychiatrists reduced suicide rates, but the association was small. Psychiatrist availability may also partially reduce the effects of social disintegration at the county level. Primary care was not associated with suicide once other variables, including hospital beds were taken into account. Results provide evidence to suggest that greater mental health promotion might reduce area inequalities in suicide rates. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Objectives
   What are the correlates of suicide among blacks and whites? One body of literature suggests that structural factors such as poverty, inequality, joblessness, and family disruption are the key contributors, while another literature considers the availability of firearms to be the central factor. No studies have thoroughly explored both possibilities together and thus we know little about the relative contributions of motivation to commit suicide due to structural conditions and opportunity to commit suicide due to firearm availability. The current study addresses this issue.
   Methods
   Using suicide data from Mortality Multiple Cause of Death Records and 2000 Census data, we examine the roles of motivation and opportunity in shaping suicide rates among young white and young black males in U.S. cities.
   Results
   We find racial differences in the predictors of suicide; although concentrated disadvantage directly affects suicide among young white males, it only raises levels for young black males by increasing access to firearms. This finding is confirmed in additional analyses, which examine the effects of concentrated disadvantage on black and white gun and nongun suicides separately.
   Conclusion
   The findings suggest complex relationships among the structural characteristics of cities, gun availability, and suicide. They also begin to address unresolved issues in the literature including why blacks have demonstrated comparatively lower rates of suicide despite higher levels of disadvantage as well as what may have fueled the increase in young black male suicide over the last 30 years. Finally, the findings have important implications for the study of race and suicide prevention.

AB Background: Restriction of access to suicide methods has been shown to effectively reduce suicide mortality rates.
   Aims: To examine how the global economic crisis of 2008 and the firearm legislation reform of 1997 affected suicide and homicide mortality rate within Austria.
   Methods: Official data for the years 1985-2016 for firearm certificates, suicide, homicide, unemployment rates and alcohol consumption were examined using auto regressive error and Poisson regression models.
   Results: Firearm certificates, total suicide mortality rate, suicide and homicides by firearms, and the fraction of firearm suicides/homicides among all suicides/homicides decreased after the firearm legislation reform in 1997. However, significant trend changes can be observed after 2008. The availability of firearm certificates significantly increased and was accompanied by significant changes in trends of firearm suicide and homicide rates. Concurrently, the total suicide mortality rate in 2008, for the first time since 1985, stopped its decreasing trend. While the total homicide rate further decreased, the fraction of firearm homicides among all homicides significantly increased.
   Conclusion: The initially preventative effect of the firearm legislation reform in Austria in 1997 seems to have been counteracted by the global economic downturn of 2008. Increased firearm availability was associated with corresponding increases in both firearm suicide and firearm homicide mortality. Restrictive firearm legislation should be an imperative part of a country's suicide prevention programme. Although firearm legislation reform may have long-lasting effects, societal changes may facilitate compensatory firearm acquisitions and thus counteract preventive efforts, calling in turn again for adapted counter-measures.

ID CROSS-NATIONAL ANALYSIS; INTEGRATION; INEQUALITY
AB Publication of 19th-century age- and gender-specific suicide rates (Morselli, 1882, Table XXIX) and similar 20th-century suicide rates (World Health Organization 1956, Table 4) invited comparative study of the age structures of suicide, but Girard's 1993 article was the first detailed effort to construct a measure of age structure that would allow systematic comparative analysis of cross-national data, We replaced Girard's qualitative typology with a quantitative measure of age structures. We then tested the theory that economic development is a key to understanding the age structure of suicide. We found no difference between these structures around 1850 and those in industrialized countries more than a century later. Differences between the male age structure of suicide in the United States and the other 19 developed countries in the 1955-1994 period were measured. We also found that change in the age structure in each country between 1955-1964 and 1985-1994 was statistically significant in 19 of the 20 countries. Over this period the share of total suicides to men ages 15-44 increased in nearly all countries, while the share to men 45-74 declined. Regression analysis using measures of societal integration, the culture of suicide, and the 1955-1964 suicide rate successfully predicted the 1985-1994 age structure in 18 of 20 countries.

AB Suicide rates are higher in rural communities than in their urban counterparts. Of particular concern are veterans residing in rural communities, who have a 20% higher risk of dying by suicide than veterans who live in urban areas. The objective of this manuscript is to assess the availability of evidence-based and promising practices to support a community-based suicide prevention effort for rural veterans. We compiled a compendium of evidence-based and promising practices-the "menu of options"-with resources across 4 levels: increasing access to crisis services, enhancing primary care suicide prevention, training community members, and raising public awareness. We compiled resources from multiple sources, then reviewed and rated each one to arrive at consensus on the final selections. The final menu includes 70 resources. However, only 20 are tailored for veterans, only one for rural communities, and none for rural veterans. More research is needed to identity effective strategies and develop rural-tailored resources for preventing suicide among this unique and often underserved population. The menu of options represents a first step toward developing an approach to rural veteran-suicide prevention that aligns with evidence-based practice, theory, and a public health model for suicide prevention.

ID EVENTUAL SUICIDE; WORST-POINT; INPATIENTS; DISORDERS; IDEATION
AB Background: Suicide is the third leading cause of death in the United States for youth 12-17 years or age. Acute psychiatric hospitalization represents a clear worst point clinically and acute suicide risk is the most common reason for psychiatric admission. We sought to determine factors associated with differences in individual suicide risk assessment for children and adolescents during acute psychiatric admission.
   Methods: Study participants were 1153 youth consecutively admitted to an inpatient psychiatry unit who completed a self-administered Suicide Status Form (SSF) within 24 h of admission. Additional information on suicide risk factors was obtained through medical chart: abstraction.
   Results: Females reported significantly greater psychological pain, stress, hopelessness, and self hate on the SSF and were significantly more likely to have made a suicide attempt just prior to the index hospital admission (OR=1.59, SE=0.29; Cl=1.12-2.26), report a family history of suicide (OR=2.02, SE=0.33; Cl=1.47-2.78), and had experienced a greater number of inpatient psychiatry admissions related to suicidal ideation (RR=1.33, SE=0.13; Cl=110-1.61). High school aged youth and those with a primary diagnosis of depression displayed consistently elevated SSF scores and risk factors for suicide compared to comparison groups.
   Limitations: Diagnosis was determined through chart abstraction. Responses to access to firearm question had missing data for 46% of the total sample.
   Conclusions: Systematic administration of a suicide-specific measure at admission may help clinicians improve identification of suicide risk factors in youth in inpatient psychiatry settings. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE Violence; Firearms; Epidemiology
ID SUICIDE RATES; OUTCOMES; CHILDREN; PREVENTION
AB Objective. This paper examines the epidemiology of fatal and nonfatal firearm violence in the United States. Trends over two decades in homicide, assault, self-directed and unintentional firearm injuries are described along with current demographic characteristics of victimization and health impact.
   Method. Fatal firearm injury data were obtained from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). Nonfatal firearm injury data were obtained from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS). Trends were tested using Joinpoint regression analyses. CDC Cost of Injury modules were used to estimate costs associated with firearm deaths and injuries.
   Results. More than 32,000 persons die and over 67,000 persons are injured by firearms each year. Case fatality rates are highest for self-harm related firearm injuries, followed by assault-related injuries. Males, racial/ethnic minority populations, and young Americans (with the exception of firearm suicide) are disproportionately affected. The severity of such injuries is distributed relatively evenly across outcomes from outpatient treatment to hospitalization to death. Firearm injuries result in over $48 billion in medical and work loss costs annually, particularly fatal firearm injuries. From 1993 to 1999, rates of firearm violence declined significantly. Declines were seen in both fatal and nonfatal firearm violence and across all types of intent. While unintentional firearm deaths continued to decline from 2000 to 2012, firearm suicides increased and nonfatal firearm assaults increased to their highest level since 1995.
   Conclusion. Firearm injuries are an important public health problem in the United States, contributing substantially each year to premature death, illness, and disability. Understanding the nature and impact of the problem is only a first step toward preventing firearm violence. A science-driven approach to understand risk and protective factors and identify effective solutions is key to achieving measurable reductions in firearm violence. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Substance use is associated with suicidal ideation, planning and attempts among adolescents, but it is unclear how this association varies across different types and number of substances. This study examined the association between patterns of substance use and suicidality among a nationally representative sample of high school students in the United States during the last decade.
   Data from the 2001 to 2009 Youth Risk Behavior Survey including 73,183 high school students were analyzed. Logistic regression analyses examined the association between lifetime use of ten common substances of abuse (alcohol, cocaine, ecstasy, hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, marijuana, methamphetamines, steroids, and tobacco) and four measures of suicidality over the last year (suicidal ideation, suicide plan, suicide attempt, and severe suicide attempt requiring medical attention), controlling for potential confounders (socio-demographic variables, interpersonal violence, sexual intercourse, and symptoms of depression and eating disorder).
   Among the ten substances, univariate analysis demonstrates that adolescents reporting a history of heroin use have the strongest association with suicidal ideation, suicide plan, suicide attempts and severe suicide attempts in the last year (odds ratio = 5.0, 5.9, 12.0, and 23.6 compared to non-users), followed by users of methamphetamines (OR = 4.3-13.1) and steroids (OR = 3.7-11.8). Cocaine, ecstasy, hallucinogens and inhalants had a moderate association with suicidality (OR = 3.1-10.8). Users of marijuana, alcohol and tobacco also had an increased odds ratio of suicidality (OR = 1.9-5.2). The association between each of ten substances and the four measures of suicidality remained significant with multivariate analysis controlling for multiple confounders (p < 0.05), except for the association between alcohol use and severe suicide attempts. The seven illicit substances had a stronger association with severe suicide attempts as compared to all other confounding risk factors except depression. The number of substances used had a graded relationship to suicidality.
   Substance abuse is a strong risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors among American high school students, with the strength of this relationship dramatically increasing with particular illicit drugs and a higher number of substances. The findings reinforce the importance of routine screening for substance abuse in the assessment of adolescent suicide risk.

TI SUICIDE PREVENTION AMONG VETERANS
SO VETERANS BENEFITS AND CARE
SE Defense Security and Strategy
LA English
DT Article; Book Chapter
AB Numerous news stories in the popular print and electronic media have documented suicides among servicemembers and veterans returningfrom Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). In the United States, there are more than 30,000 suicides annually. Suicides among veterans are included in this number, but it is not known in what proportion. There is no nationwide system for surveillance of suicide specifically among veterans. Recent data show that about 20% of suicide deaths nationwide could be among veterans. It is not known what proportion of these deaths are among OIF/OEF veterans.
   Veterans have a number of risk factors that increase their chance of attempting suicide. These risk factors include combat exposure, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental health problems, traumatic brain injury (TBI), poor social support structures, and access to lethal means.
   Several bills addressing suicide in veterans have been introduced in the 110(th) Congress. On November 5, 2007, the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act (P.L. 110-110) was signed into law, requiring the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to establish a comprehensive program for suicide prevention among veterans. More recently, the Veterans Suicide Study Act (S. 2899) was introduced. This bill would require the VA to conduct a study, and report to Congress, regarding suicides among veterans since 1997.
   The VA has carried out a number of suicide prevention initiatives, including establishing a national suicide prevention hotline for veterans, conducting awareness events at VA medical centers, and screening and assessing veterans for suicide risk.
   This chapter discusses data sources and systems that can provide information about suicides in the general population and among veterans, and known risk and protective factors associated with suicide in each group. It also discusses suicide prevention efforts by the VA. It does not discuss Department of Defense (DOD) activities, or VA's treatment of risk factors for suicide, such as depression, PTSD, and substance abuse.

AB Suicide is among the leading causes of death in the United States, ranking 10th to 12th annually, depending on the year. Rates of suicide increase markedly among Americans over age 75, especially among white men. After age 85, rates are >5-fold higher in this group than in the general population. The relationship between alcohol use and later-life suicide is complex and currently ill defined. Substance use disorders, particularly alcohol abuse and dependence, are the second most common category of axis I disorders associated with completed suicide among adults aged 65 and older, following only depression. The co-occurrence of alcohol use disorders and depression heightens suicide risk. Most studies that have evaluated the effects of alcohol in geriatric suicide have focused on older adults who met DSM criteria for abuse and/or dependence. However, the majority of older adults who are experiencing problems related to their alcohol use do not meet alcohol abuse/dependence criteria. Therefore, the role of at-risk and problem alcohol use in geriatric suicide may be underestimated. Drinking among elders elevates suicide risk through interactions with other factors that are more prevalent in this age group, such as depressive symptoms, medical illness, negatively perceived health status, and low social support. This article reviews the literature related to alcohol use and suicide among older adults. Clinical and research recommendations for addressing this problem are also presented.

AB Substance use is a risk factor for suicide, suicide attempts, and fatal and non-fatal overdose, but to date, little has been done to integrate the research on suicidal behavior and overdose among substance users. This study reviews the literature on suicide and overdose among substance users with the goal of illuminating the similarities and differences between these two events. A structured review resulted in 15 articles (describing 14 unique studies) published between 1990 and 2010 that examined both overdose and suicide in samples of substance users. There is some evidence that substance users who attempt suicide are more likely to report an overdose and vice versa. This relationship may be partially explained by the fact that overdose is a common method of suicide. The results of the literature review also indicate that substance users with a history of both events may represent a group with particularly poor psychological and social functioning and severe drug-related problems. Further research is needed to understand the overlap of, and differences between, suicide and accidental overdose among individuals who misuse substances, particularly individuals who primarily use substances other than heroin. An improved understanding of the interrelationships between suicide and unintentional overdose among individuals who use alcohol or drugs is necessary to guide the development of effective prevention and intervention approaches.

AB Introduction: To examine how 12-month prevalences of suicidality vary by tobacco use.
   Methods: Data were from 325 800 adults who participated in the 2008-2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Descriptive analyses and multivariable multinomial logistic regression models were applied.
   Results: Among adults aged 18 or older in the United States during 2008-2014, 27.4% (annual average, standard error [SE] = 0.14%) were never tobacco users, 38.8% (SE = 0.17%) were former tobacco users, 5.9% (SE = 0.07%) were past-year users of other types of tobacco (non-cigarette), 20.2% (SE = 0.13%) were past-year cigarette-only users, and 7.7% (SE = 0.07%) were past-year users of cigarettes plus other types of tobacco; 2.6% (SE = 0.04%) had suicidal ideation only, 0.7% (SE = 0.02%) had suicidal ideation and suicide plan only, and 0.5% (SE = 0.02%) attempted suicide. After controlling for covariates, compared with never tobacco users, past-year users of cigarettes plus other types of tobacco were at elevated risk of all examined suicidality outcomes (adjusted relative risks [ARRs] = 1.2-1.7), and past-year cigarette-only users were at higher risk of suicide attempt (ARR = 1.4). Early age of first tobacco use was associated with higher risk of suicidal ideation and suicide plan among former tobacco users, past-year tobacco users, and past-year cigarette users (ARRs = 1.2-1.6). Among past-year tobacco users, frequencies of cigarette and cigar use were associated with suicide attempt (ARRs = 1.4-1.7). Nicotine dependence was associated with suicide attempt among past-year cigarette users (ARR = 1.2).
   Conclusions: Tobacco use is associated with 12-month suicidality among adults. Patients who use tobacco should be assessed further for mental health status and suicide risk.
   Implications: Our results revealed that tobacco use is independently associated with the 12-month suicidality outcomes among adults and identified how the prevalences of 12-month suicidality outcomes vary by tobacco use status and use characteristics among adults. These results have important clinical implications. Future research should assess the effectiveness of tobacco use questions as simple screeners for more extensive assessment of mental health status and suicide risk.

AB In the United States, 5.5 million people over the age of 40 meet criteria for visual impairment (VI). They often suffer significant psychosocial and health consequences, including reduced quality of life and depression, which can be persistent and difficult to treat. Additionally, VI may increase the risk of suicide. We report a case of a patient with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) and suicidal ideation. While this link is reasonable, there are no prior cases of suicidality among patients with ARMD. Moreover, the literature is silent regarding proper approaches to diagnosing and managing suicidality among patients with VI, especially ARMD.

AB Objectives. This study sought to identify, among youths, factors associated with characteristics such as poor health status, substance use, and suicide risk and to explore the extent to which the risk and protective factors identified cut across health-compromising behaviors.
   Methods. A survey was administered to representative samples of young people from 9 Caribbean countries.
   Results. Physical/sexual abuse and having a friend or relative who had attempted suicide were associated with an increased prevalence of health-compromising behaviors. Connectedness with parents and school and attendance at religious services were associated with fewer health risk behaviors.
   Conclusions. When the identified risk and protective factors were compared with those seen among young people in the United States, similarities as well as important differences were found.

AB National mean scores on a historical knowledge test (taken as a proxy for intelligence), stemming from representative samples of male (and female) 9th-grade school students from 26 European countries in a 1999 report by Wilberg and Lynn, were significantly positively associated with the national male (and female) suicide rates, independent of the general quality-of-living conditions in these countries. This finding replicates previous evidence from cross-national studies (by Lester and by Voracek), of a correspondence of higher national IQ to higher suicide rates, with an alternative measure of national IQ that is independent of the national IQ estimates recently published by Lynn and Vanhanen which have been used in prior studies.

AB Older adults have high rates of suicide in the United States and worldwide; rates vary markedly by gender, race, and ethnicity. Geropsychology practice guidelines (e.g., American Psychological Association [APA], 2004) indicate the need for assessment and treatment practices specific to older adults, as the phenomenology of mental disorders and psychotherapeutic change processes may shift across the lifespan. Inadequacies in the available knowledge base and in the education and training of clinicians have slowed progress in suicide research and hindered the development of a healthcare workforce that is deeply dedicated to suicide prevention. Inadequate knowledge stems from inattention to demographic differences, definitional imprecision and conceptual conflation, lack of research focus on older adults, and the exclusion of at-risk patients from clinical trials. The near absence of rigorous training and education in suicidology among clinical psychologists amplifies these problems. This article also reviews the empirical literature on suicide risk, noting in particular the roles of mood disorders, suicidal ideation and behavior, adjustment to life events, lack of social integration, personality traits, and access to lethal means. Suggestions are offered for improving risk assessment, the treatment of at-risk patients, and the development of prevention programs. Implications for training and education in clinical psychology are briefly discussed, and directions for future research are offered.

AB Background Within the context of the recent release of the 2012 National Suicide Prevention Strategy, and as the third leading cause of death for individuals 10- to 24-years-old, suicide prevention is a national priority. A consistently reported and robust risk factor for suicide is a prior suicide attempt; however few studies have investigated the consistency of self-reported lifetime suicide attempts. The goal of this study is to describe the prevalence and characteristics of inconsistent reporting of suicide attempt in a longitudinal cohort of participants annually assessed in 12 waves of data collected from middle school (age 12) to early adulthood (age 22).
   Methods Among this cohort (n = 678), we compared those who consistently, inconsistently, and never reported a suicide attempt according to demographic and clinical variables.
   Results Almost 90% (88.5%) of our sample inconsistently reported a lifetime suicide attempt. Consistent and inconsistent reporters of lifetime suicide attempt did not differ on demographic or clinical variables with the exception of higher rates of lifetime suicidal ideation among consistent reporters (P < .001). Significant clinical differences were evident between inconsistent reporters and nonattempters.
   Conclusions Some level of inconsistent reporting of suicide attempt is inevitable when schools or health care systems systematically screen for suicide risk in adolescents. Inconsistent and consistent reporters of suicide attempt differ on few demographic or clinical variables; further prospective research should investigate the reasons for inconsistent reporting as well as the validity and stability of reporting in predicting future suicidal behavior.

AB Background: Suicide represents a major health problem in the United States, and prediction of suicide attempts is difficult. No structural neuroimaging studies have been done to specifically examine findings in patients who have attempted suicide. The objective of this study was to compare MRI findings in unipolar patients with and without a history of a suicide attempt.
   Methods: In this post hoc analysis, 20 unipolar subjects with a history of a suicide attempt were matched by age and gender to unipolar subjects without a history of an attempt. Subjects were also matched on parameters such as cardiovascular history, electroconvulsive treatment history, and history of psychosis. Subjects with a history of any neurologic condition were excluded. There were no significant differences in age of onset of depression, number of episodes of depression, and Hamilton Depression scores between the two groups. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were rated rising the Coffey and Boyko, rating scales.
   Results: Unipolar patients with a history of a suicide attempt demonstrated significantly more subcortical gray matter hyperintensities compared with patients without such a history.
   Conclusions: Patients with abnormal MRI findings may be at higher risk for mood disorders and suicide attempts because of disruption of critical neuroanatomic pathways. Gray matter hyperintensities in the basal ganglia may be especially associated with risk for suicide attempts. (C) 2001 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

AB Background: This paper argues that the decline in the availability of long-term, intensive mental health services, particularly through state mental health hospital systems, has had negative impacts on firearm-related deaths and possibly on the incidence of mass shooting events.Aims: Establish the effect of reduced availability of long-term, intensive mental health treatment on firearm-related violence in the United States.Method: Ordinary least squares regressions on cross-sectional data of US states.Results: Mass shooting perpetrators had significantly higher rates of mental illness than the general population. In addition, using simple regressions, this paper's results demonstrate that increasing the number of state psychiatric hospital beds is associated with lower rates of homicide.Conclusions: The shrinking number of intensive, long-term mental health facilities in US states has had many negative consequences, including higher rates of firearm homicide.

AB Objective: Model the global distribution of public mass shooters around the world. Method: Negative binomial regression is used to test the effects of homicide rates, suicide rates, firearm ownership rates, and several control variables on public mass shooters per country from 1966 to 2012. Results: The global distribution of public mass shooters appears partially attributable to cross-national differences in firearms availability but not associated with cross-national homicide or suicide rates. Conclusion: The United States and other nations with high firearm ownership rates may be particularly susceptible to future public mass shootings, even if they are relatively peaceful or mentally healthy according to other national indicators.

AB Older men have a higher rate of suicide than the general population, but little is known about the prevalence and correlates of suicidality among older male veterans. In this study, we evaluated the prevalence, and risk and protective factors associated with current suicidal ideation (SI) and past suicide attempt (SA) in a contemporary, nationally representative sample of older male veterans. We analyzed data from 1962 male veterans aged 60 or older who participated in the National Health and Resilience Veterans Survey (NHRVS) between October and December 2011. Bivariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression were used to evaluate risk and protective factors associated with current SI and past SA in the full sample, and separately among combat and non-combat veterans. Six percent of the sample reported past 2-week SI, and combat veterans were more likely to contemplate suicide (9.2%) than non-combat (4.0%) veterans. Lifetime SA was reported by 2.6% of respondents. Major depression and physical health difficulties were the strongest risk factors for SI in combat veterans, while generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) was the strongest risk factor for SI in non-combat veterans. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was independently associated with SI in both groups of veterans, and social connectedness was negatively related to SI in both groups. These results suggest that a significant proportion of older male veterans in the United States contemplates suicide, with higher rates of SI among combat than noncombat veterans. Interventions designed to mitigate psychological distress and physical difficulties, and to promote social connectedness may help mitigate suicidality risk in this population.

ID SURVEILLANCE; PATTERNS; SYSTEM; STATES; RATES
AB Objectives: Suicide is an ongoing public health problem in the United States. The purpose of this epidemiologic investigation was to characterize and identify populations at risk of suicide, which in turn may lead to targeted intervention and improvements in suicide prevention.
   Study design: This is a descriptive analysis of 657 suicide decedents autopsied by the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics between 7/1/2003 and 6/30/2018 (180 months, 15 years).
   Methods: Data were obtained via autopsy report abstraction. Chi-squared tests were used for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used for continuous variables. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS 9.3.
   Results: Decedents were primarily white (88.2%) and male (75.7%). Average age was 43 years. Suicides were more likely to occur at a residence (69.3%), earlier in the week, and in the late night to early morning hours. Suicides were most likely to occur in spring and least likely to occur in winter. The most common method was a firearm (44.6%), most often a handgun (61.3% of firearm suicides). Less than one-half (42.8%) of decedents communicated intent to end their life. Approximately one-quarter (22.1%) of suicides were without a known identified life stressor or a known inciting event, a phenomenon that was markedly more common among men.
   Conclusions: More than one-half of decedents left no communication of intent to commit suicide, and one-quarter-more commonly men-had no known life stressor or other specifically identified motivating factor. While women were more likely to have a known mental health condition, prior contact with mental health care, or prior suicidal behavior, we found that, statistically speaking, the typical profile of a completed suicide is a white male who used a firearm in his place of residence. Future studies should seek to further elucidate factors leading to suicide in this at-risk population. (C) 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Physicians and veterinarians are at increased risk for suicide compared to the general population. In particular, this risk appears to be especially pertinent to females in both of these professions. Although increased risk is well-documented, less is known about potential causes for suicidality in these groups. A host of risk factors have been examined in recent research, including job stressors, personality traits, access to lethal medications, and unique work experiences. In addition to these factors, the interpersonal psychological theory of suicidal behavior may provide promise in specifying why physicians and veterinarians are at increased risk for suicide. While there is recognition of mental health issues in these professions, significant treatment barriers remain.

AB The present study reframes the strong Black woman (SBW) identity as an intersectional cultural coping style that impacts experiences of depression and suicide for African American women in the United States. This study draws on previous findings that distilled affect regulation, self-reliance, and caretaking as SBW components. The researcher explored the SBW as a moderator of the existent relationship between depression and suicide in African American women. Findings indicated that depressed African American women who utilize this coping style, particularly affect regulation, demonstrated increased risk for suicidality. The researcher discusses implications for research and treatment options from a multicultural, feminist framework.

AB Based on Durkheim's 'Control theory,' we explored the association between frequency of terror attacks in Israel and the frequency of suicide attempts admitted to the Emergency Room of a major general hospital in Tel-Aviv (1999-2004). Analysis of the six-year study period as a whole revealed no significant correlation between the variables, with the exception of one 11-month segment within it (December 2000-October 2001) that did show a statistically significant positive correlation, and in opposition to Durkeim's hypothesis. It is suggested that suicide attempts as a phenomena should be seen as a product of a multivariate model, in which the social context plays a role as well.

AB PURPOSE: We investigated whether the substance use problems of excessive alcohol consumption and marijuana use, firearm availability, depressive symptoms, and mental health service utilization, differed among white and African American suicide decedents compared with natural cause-of-death decedents.
   METHODS: The subjects were a representative sample of 22,957 deceased individuals aged 15 years or older from the 1993 US National Mortality Followback Survey (NMFS). A matched case-control study was constructed for suicide decedents aged 15 to 64 years, with natural death controls frequency matched to cases by age and gender. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to examine the associations of risk factors with suicide by race.
   RESULTS: When compared with natural causes of death, suicide deaths among white decedents were associated with use of mental health services, heavy drinking, marijuana use, depression symptoms, and firearm availability. Suicides by African American decedents were associated only with use of mental health services, marijuana, and firearm availability. The interaction of mental health service use and marijuana use was significant only for white suicide decedents.
   CONCLUSION: This study contributes to the limited understanding of how risk factors unique to suicide differ, and possibly interact, among African American and white decedents. Similarities and differences in risk factors should be considered in suicide prevention planning efforts.

   METHODS; UNITED-STATES; RISK-FACTORS; PREVENTION
AB Objective: To evaluate whether reaction to survival of a suicide attempt and method of the index attempt predicted repeat suicide attempts within 6 months.
   Method: Data came from the Suicide Assessment Form in Emergency Psychiatry (SAFE) Database Project, which contains information on all presentations to emergency psychiatric services at the 2 tertiary hospitals in Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada (N = 7,007). During a 4-year period (2009-2012), 922 individuals presented with suicide attempts. Logistic regressions were used to examine whether a person's reaction to attempt survival and the method of attempt predicted repeat suicide attempt within 6 months.
   Results: Of the 922 participants, 82 (8.8%) presented with another suicide attempt within 6 months. Ambivalence about attempt survival (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.84; 95% CI, 1.455.54; P < .01) and wishing to be dead (adjusted OR = 2.68; 95% CI, 1.17-6.17; P < .05) predicted future attempts even when adjusted for age, sex, depression, substance abuse, and method of the initial attempt. Method of the index attempt did not predict future suicide attempts in adjusted models (adjusted OR = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.35-1.25; P > .05).
   Conclusions: Assessment of the patient's reaction to survival, regardless of method of attempt, is important to identify risk of repeat attempts. (C) Copyright 2014 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB Prior research has shown that most known risk factors for suicide attempts in the general population actually predict suicide ideation rather than attempts among ideators. Yet clinical interest in predicting suicide attempts often involves the evaluation of risk among patients with ideation. We examined a number of characteristics of suicidal thoughts hypothesized to predict incident attempts in a retrospective analysis of lifetime ideators (N = 3,916) drawn from a large (N = 29,982), representative sample of United States Army soldiers. The most powerful predictors of first nonfatal lifetime suicide attempt in a multivariate model controlling for previously known predictors (e.g., demographics, mental disorders) were: recent onset of ideation, presence and recent onset of a suicide plan, low controllability of suicidal thoughts, extreme risk-taking or "tempting fate," and failure to answer questions about the characteristics of one's suicidal thoughts. A predictive model using these risk factors had strong accuracy (area under the curve [AUC] = .93), with 66.2% of all incident suicide attempts occurring among the 5% of soldiers with highest composite predicted risk. This high concentration of risk in this retrospective study suggests that a useful clinical decision support model could be constructed from prospective data to identify those with highest risk of subsequent suicide attempt.

AB This study investigates the association between drug use and lifetime suicidal behaviors among Asian American women (n = 720) residing throughout Massachusetts, using data collected from 2010 to 2011. Logistic regression models identified that a history of hard drug use alone or in combination with soft drug use has a significant association with both suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among Asian American women, adjusting for demographic covariates, history of psychiatric diagnosis, and family communication. These findings highlight the importance of addressing hard drug use when designing suicide prevention programs for Asian American women.

TI Completed suicides and self-harm in Malaysia: a systematic review
SO GENERAL HOSPITAL PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Review
DE Suicide; Self-harm Malaysia; Prevalence; Correlates
ID RISK-FACTORS; DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; SUICIDALITY; IDEATION; BEHAVIOR
AB Objective: Most of the research into suicide and self-harm has been conducted in the United States and Europe, yet the volume of research does not reflect the distribution of suicide globally, with Asia accounting for up to 60% of all suicides. The present study systematically reviews the literature to assess the prevalence and correlates of suicidal acts in Malaysia in Southeast Asia.
   Methods: Five relevant databases were searched from inception up to February 2014, and a narrative synthesis of the results from the included studies was performed. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were correlational survey research and archival/observational research describing self-harm and suicide. Outcomes included completed suicides and self-harm including suicide attempts and self-poisoning, suicide plans and suicidal ideation.
   Results: In total, 39 studies met the inclusion criteria. The principal findings were that the prevalence of suicide in Malaysia is approximately 6-8 per 100,000 population per year and that there is an excess of suicide among men, people younger than 40 years and the Indian minority group. The past-month prevalence rates of suicidal ideation, plans and attempts are 1.7, 0.9% and 0.5%, respectively, whereas the past-year prevalence rates of suicidal ideation range between 6% and 8%.
   Conclusions: The present research marks a first step towards understanding the prevalence and correlates of suicide and self-harm in Malaysia. However, the heterogeneity of the included studies was high. Further research into the antecedents, consequences and interventions for suicide and self-harm in the Malaysian context is required.

AB Background: There had been few studies on seasonality of Chinese suicide especially for Chinese rural youths. In this research, we wanted to find the seasonal pattern and the relationship between personal and behavioral characteristics and seasonal variation of suicide.
   Method: We examined Chinese rural young adults aged 15 to 34 years who died by suicide using Psychological Autopsy method to gather information from the informants of suicide victims. Altogether 330 suicide victims were collected among which 144 were female and 186 were male. The chi(2) test was used for comparison, and the multiple logistic regressions and Odds Ratios were adopted to analyze the seasonal preferences of suicide victims.
   Result: Seasonal summer peak of suicide emerged in total population and in each subgroup. Four logistic regression models were constructed: in spring, six variables were included in the regression model, which were Gender (OR = 1.627), Pesticide Used (OR = 1.622), Life Events (OR = 2.764), Suicide Intent (OR = 1.641), Marital Status (OR = 0.574) and Family Conflicts (OR = 0.590); in summer, only Marital Status (OR = 1.927) was accepted; in autumn, four variables including Marital Problems (OR = 1.924), Trait Anxiety (OR = 1.758), Gender (OR = 0.518) and Religion (OR = 0.534) were retained; in winter, Pesticide Used (OR = 0.486) and Suicide Intent (OR = 0.614) were retained.
   Conclusion: Seasonal variations of personal and behavioral characteristics, combined with social activities, might also play very important roles in suicide seasonality. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study compared information gathered from medical examiner reports to information gathered from law enforcement reports in characterizing incidents of homicide and homicide followed by suicide that were abstracted for a public health violent-death surveillance system. The authors found that law enforcement reports contribute substantively to the surveillance system and often augment or provide additional information to the medical examiner reports. The utility of law enforcement data, particularly the narrative information, must be balanced with the time needed to gather the law enforcement reports and funding limitations. As violent-death surveillance needs grow, linking police and other law enforcement data with medical examiner and other public health data sources will provide a clearer picture of the circumstances relating to homicide and other violent deaths at the state and national level.

AB This cross-sectional study evaluated lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts in 170 HIV/AIDS patients with substance use disorders and the impact of suicide attempt history on subjective indices of quality of life and objective indices of cognitive and physical functioning. All patients met the diagnostic criteria for past-year cocaine or opioid use disorders and 27% of patients also had co-occurring alcohol use disorders. Compared to their counterparts without a history of a suicide attempt, patients with a history of a suicide attempt (n=60, 35.3%) had significantly poorer emotional and cognitive quality of life scores (ps<.05), but not physical, social, or functional/global quality-of-life scores. Lifetime suicide attempt status was unrelated to objective indices of cognitive functioning, but there was a non-significant trend (p=.07) toward lower viral loads in those with a lifetime suicide attempt relative to those without. The findings indicate that suicide attempt histories are prevalent among HIV/AIDS patients with substance use disorders and relate to poorer perceived emotional and cognitive quality of life, but not objective functioning. HIV/AIDS patients with substance use disorders should be screened for lifetime histories of suicide attempts and offered assistance to improve perceived emotional and cognitive functioning.

   Methods: Perfect Depression Care (PDC) is a quality improvement suicide prevention initiative within the Behavioral Health Services (BHS) division of the Henry Ford Health System. Eligible subjects were all patients who received services from BHS, were members of the health maintenance organization, and had a medical group physician during the 11-year study period. Mortality data were collected internally and from government-collected death records, and were linked to treatment utilization data from the medical record.
   Results:The mean suicide rate was 96.6 per 100,000 during the 2-year baseline period (1999-2000) and declined to 19.1 per 100,000 during the initiative (2002-2009) using both sources of data combined. We observed a similar statistically significant (P < .001) reduction in the suicide death rate using both the internal and government data sources, There were no significant differences between the 2 sources of data in the mean suicide rates for the baseline and intervention periods (P > .05). The data sources did differ in the capture of unique suicide deaths.
   Conclusions: Internally collected data were an effective measure of suicide deaths in the PDC initiative. A combination of internal and government-collected records may be most effective for future suicide prevention programs.

AB Background: This study aims to estimate suicide risk and its socio-demographic determinants among cancer patients in the country showing the highest suicide rates among developed countries. Methods: The study is based on a unique census-linked dataset based on the linkages between the records from death and cancer registers and the 2001 population census records. Standardized mortality ratios for suicide (SMRs) were calculated for patients diagnosed with cancer in Lithuania between April 6, 2001 and December 31, 2009, relative to suicide rates in the general population. Results: We found that the relative suicide risk was elevated for both males and females, with SMRs of 1.43 (95% CI 1.23-1.66) and 1.32 (95% CI 0.95-1.80), respectively. This relationship for females became statistically significant and stronger after excluding skin cancers. The highest suicide risks were observed at older ages and during the period shortly after the diagnosis. The groups showing an increased suicide risk include lower educated, non-married, and rural male patients. Conclusion: The results of our study point to inadequacies of the health care system in dealing with mental health problems of cancer patients. Interventions allowing early detection of depression or suicidal ideation may help to prevent suicide among cancer patients in Lithuania. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To describe the characteristics associated with suicide in older persons residing in long-term care (LTC) facilities, to compare the characteristics of suicide cases in LTC with those of cases in the community, and to evaluate trends in suicide in these settings over the past 15 years.
   The New York City (NYC) Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME).
   Suicide deaths in NYC from 1990 to 2005.
   Location and method of suicide death reported by OCME.
   Suicides in older persons in LTC and community-dwelling older adults were compared in terms of demographic characteristics and method used. Trends in suicide rate ratios (RRs) were examined using zero-inflated Poisson regression.
   Over the study period, there were 1,771 suicides among NYC residents aged 60 and older: 47 in LTC and 1,724 in the community. Cases in LTC tended to be older (P <.02) but did not differ from community cases in terms of race or sex. Suicides in LTC were significantly less likely (RR=0.05, P <.002) to be due to firearms and 2.49 times as likely to be due to a long fall (P <.002) as community cases. Over the 15-year period, there was a significant decrease in the relative rate of suicide in community-dwelling adults (RR=0.97, P <.001) but no change in residents of LTC (RR=1.05, P <.17).
   Suicide risk in community-dwelling older adults has declined over the past 15 years but has not changed in LTC facilities. This suggests that prevention efforts may not be reaching this population effectively.

AB This study is the first to investigate the relationship between perceived emotional support and negative interaction with family members and suicide ideation and attempts among African American and Caribbean black adults.
   Cross-sectional epidemiologic data from the National Survey of American Life and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between perceived emotional support and negative interaction and suicide behaviors among 3,570 African Americans and 1,621 Caribbean blacks age 18 and older.
   Multivariate analyses found that perceived emotional support was associated with lower odds of suicide ideation and attempts for African Americans and Caribbean blacks. Negative interaction with family was associated with greater odds of suicide ideation among African Americans and Caribbean blacks. Ethnicity moderated the impact of emotional support and negative interaction on suicide attempts; among Caribbean blacks, those who reported more frequent emotional support from their family had a significantly greater reduced risk for suicide attempts than African Americans. The effect of negative interaction on suicide attempts was also more pronounced for Caribbean blacks compared to African Americans.
   Negative interaction was a risk factor for suicide ideation and emotional support was a protective factor for attempts and ideation. These associations were observed even after controlling for any mental disorder. The findings demonstrate the importance of social relationships as both risk and protective factors for suicide and ethnic differences in suicidal ideation and attempts among black Americans.

TI School violence and adolescent suicide: strategies for effective

SO EDUCATIONAL REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID AWARENESS
AB The public school system in the United Stares has always presented itself as representing the hallmarks of vital socialization, equality in education, hope for the future and sense of community. This picture has changed drastically in the past 20 years. Chaos seems to be replacing community. This fact is only too apparent when we read recent accounts of the tragedies that have unfolded in the past 3 years in Pearl, Mississippi, West Paducah, Kentucky, Jonesboro, Arkansas, Springfield, Oregon of Littleton, Colorado. As a result of the deteriorating social environment and a significant growing fiscal crisis faced by our nation's schools, children are encountering substantial hurdles on their journey toward responsible adulthood. Two current trends, which are negatively affecting students' educational experience and quality of life are violence and suicide. Juvenile violence and suicide are becoming increasingly commonplace across the United States. In 1994, an average of one young person aged 24 and lounger killed themselves every 1 hour and 39.6 minutes. The number of incidents of violence and the severity of these acts have also dramatically increased over the past 5 to 7 years. This article addresses the causes and strategies for prevention of school violence and adolescent suicide and delineates a holistic integrated prevention model.

AB Preadolescent suicide continues to be a growing problem and is a leading cause of death for children ages 5 to 14 in the United States. Thwarted belonging offers an explanation as a risk factor for suicide. A lack of connectedness is one of the ways in which thwarted belonging is experienced. Using a qualitative phenomenological research design, the purpose of this study was to understand children's connection with their parents prior to a suicide attempt. We conducted interviews with ten children ages 10 to 13 who were on an inpatient psychiatric unit due to making a suicide attempt. The participants enrolled were five males and five females from Southern California, five Caucasian and five Hispanic. The interview questions were based on the parent-child connectedness model and the responses were coded by using a sentence-by-sentence method. Thematic analysis was used to derive the significant themes from the data. The themes that provided an explanation for thwarted belonging were not sharing personal things with parents, not wanting to grow up to be like parents, and not feeling close to parents. The themes that were found to be a protective factor against suicide were activities and playing together, expressions of affection, and pride about education and grades. A lack of connectedness with parents does explain an aspect of thwarted belonging for preadolescent children who have attempted suicide.

TI Media coverage of Robin Williams' suicide in the United States: A
   contributor to contagion?
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID REPORTING GUIDELINES; MENTAL-ILLNESS; FIDELITY; NEWS
AB Evidence suggests that suicide rates can increase following the suicide of a prominent celebrity or peer, sometimes known as 'suicide contagion'. The risk of contagion is especially high when media coverage is detailed and sensational. A recent study reported a 10% increase in U.S. suicides in the months following the suicide of comedian Robin Williams, who died in August 2014. The authors tentatively linked this increase to sensational media coverage; however, no content analysis of U.S. media was performed. As such, the aim of the present study is to formally examine the tone and content of U.S. newspaper coverage of Williams' suicide. The primary objective is to assess adherence to suicide reporting guidelines in U.S. newspapers after his suicide. The secondary objective is to identify common emerging themes discussed in these articles. The tertiary objective is to compare patterns of results in the U.S media with those in the Canadian media. Articles about Williams' suicide were collected from 10 U.S. newspapers in the 30-day period following his death using systematic retrieval software, which were then examined for adherence to suicide reporting recommendations. An inductive thematic analysis was also undertaken. A total of 63 articles were included in the study. We found that 100% of articles did not call it a 'successful' suicide, 96.8% did not use pejorative phrases and 71% did not say 'commit' suicide. However, only 11% included information about help-seeking, 27% tended to romanticize his suicide and 46% went into detail about the method. The most prominent emerging theme was Williams' struggles with mental illness and addiction. These findings suggest that U.S. newspapers moderately adhered to best practice recommendations when reporting Williams' suicide. Key recommendations were underapplied, which may have contributed to suicide contagion. New interventions targeting U.S. journalists and media may be needed to improve suicide reporting.

AB BACKGROUND: Depression is highly prevalent in patients with pancreatic cancer and can result in fatal outcomes from suicides. The authors report suicide rates among patients with pancreatic cancer in the United States and identify factors associated with greater suicide rates. METHODS: The current study reviewed data in the SEER database for patients diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma from 1995-2005. Logistic regression models were used to perform multivariate modeling for factors associated with suicide, while Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess factors affecting survival. RESULTS: Among 36,221 patients followed for 22,145 person-years, the suicide rate was 135.4 per 100,000 person-years. The corresponding rate in the US population aged 65-74 years was 12.5 per 100,000 person-years, with a Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) of 10.8 (95% CI, 9.2-12.7). Greater suicide rates were noted in males (Odds Ratio (OR) 13.5 [95% CI, 3.2-56.9, P<.001]) and, among males, in patients undergoing an operative intervention (OR 2.5 [95% CI, 1.0-6.5, P=.05]). Married men had a lesser risk of committing suicide (OR 0.3 [95% CI, 0.1-0.6, P=.002]). Median survival among patients undergoing operative intervention was 2 months for those who committed suicide compared with 10 months for those who did not commit suicide. CONCLUSIONS: Male patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma have a risk of suicide nearly 11 times that of the general population. Patients who undergo an operative intervention are more likely to commit suicide, generally in the early postoperative period. Cancer 2011;117:642-7. (C) 2010 American Cancer Society.

AB To identify subtypes of adolescent suicide attempters by examining risk profiles related to substance use, violent behavior, and depressive symptoms. To examine the relationship between these subtypes and having had two or more suicide attempts during the past year. To explore race and gender differences across subtypes of suicide attempters.
   Data were combined from five nationally representative cohorts of the US Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) and focused on a subpopulation of youth who reported a suicide attempt requiring medical attention. Latent class analysis was used to identify subtypes of suicide attempters.
   Analysis yielded three classes of youth who attempted suicide, distinguishable by their levels of substance use and violent behaviors: low substance use and violent behaviors, high substance use and violent behaviors, and extreme substance use and violent behaviors. All three classes had a high propensity for endorsing depressive symptoms. The proportion of youth with two or more suicide attempts during the past year increased across subgroup of attempters with higher levels of substance use and violent behaviors. Racial and gender differences were found across subtypes of suicide attempters.
   Preventing and treating the co-occurrence of substance use and violent behaviors may serve as essential strategies for reducing suicide attempts, especially among male youth. The use of public health strategies for suicide prevention should take into account the different needs of youth at risk for suicide.

TI Euthanasia and assisted suicide: Comparison of legal aspects in
   Switzerland and other countries
SO MEDICINE SCIENCE AND THE LAW
LA English
DT Article
AB The purpose of this paper is to present the legal aspects associated with assisted suicide in Switzerland and compare them with those in other countries. Like euthanasia, assisted suicide is a subject that induces much discussion in many countries. While the law is very liberal in some countries, such as Belgium and the Netherlands (where both euthanasia and assisted suicide take place), these practices are very controversial in other countries, such as France, where they remain taboo subjects.
   In the United States of America, the laws concerning assisted suicide can differ greatly from one state to another. For example, in Oregon, assisted suicide is allowed if applied by a medical doctor; in others, this act is illegal. In Canada, it is punishable according to the Criminal Code.
   In Switzerland euthanasia is punishable by law. However, the penal code does not condemn assisted suicide, whether carried out by a medical doctor or another person, provided it is not carried out through selfish motives. The application of these practices has become simplified in recent years and societies for the right to die with dignity based on this principle have come into being (Exit and Dignitas).
   In the French- and German-speaking parts of Switzerland the association Exit assists individuals living in Switzerland with serious progressive and incurable disease in their engagement to end their life. The association Dignitas, in the German-speaking part of Switzerland, also undertakes - in the same circumstances - to assist individuals coming from foreign countries. Dignitas welcomes several such individuals every year, especially from Germany, where a similar approach does not currently exist.

AB Objective: The purpose was to examine temporal associations among meaning in life and suicide risk across suicide-focused interventions. Methods: A secondary analysis was conducted using data from a randomized clinical trial testing the efficacy of a standard crisis response plan (S-CRP) and a CRP enhanced with a discussion about the patient's reasons for living (E-CRP) as compared to treatment as usual (TAU). A total of 97 active duty U.S. Army personnel presenting to military emergency departments and outpatient behavioral health clinics with active suicide ideation or a lifetime history of suicide attempts were enrolled between January 2013 and February 2016. Meaning in life and suicide risk were assessed at baseline and 1, 3, and 6 month follow-ups. Results: The association of meaning in life with time-lagged suicide risk significantly differed across treatment groups (p = .024). In TAU, meaning in life was not significantly associated with later reductions in suicide risk. In S-CRP, a stronger desire to establish meaning in life was significantly associated with later reductions in suicide risk (p < .001). In E-CRP, a stronger sense of purpose and meaning in life was significantly associated with later reductions in suicide risk (p < .001). Discussion: Faster reductions in suicide risk observed among patients who receive a CRP are attributable in part by the effects of strengthened meaning in life. Different facets of meaning in life contribute to reduced suicide risk in unique ways across treatments with varying components.

AB Lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth (LGBY) report higher rates of mental health concerns compared to heterosexual youth due to minority stressors. This study examined the interpersonal and intrapersonal variables that predict psychological distress and self-reported suicide attempts in a sample of 61 LGBY in the Mid-South, which is a highly overlooked regional area for LGBY research. Youth who lost friends when coming out were 29 times more likely to report suicide attempts, and those who experienced psychological maltreatment from caregivers were 9.5 times more likely to report a suicide attempt. Internalized heterosexism, feelings of guilt or shame, and psychological maltreatment from caregivers were significant predictors of depression and anxiety symptoms. This study highlights the importance of creating affirming spaces for LGBY, particularly in areas of the country that experience greater political oppression of sexual minorities, such as the Mid-South.

AB Background. The relationships between acculturation and suicide were investigated in East Taiwan.
   Methods. Psychological autopsy interviews were conducted for consecutive suicides from two native Taiwanese groups (Atayal and Ami) (N = 30 for each group); each of them was matched with two controls for age, sex and area of residence. The Taiwan Aboriginal Acculturation Scale was used to measure the extent of acculturation.
   Results. A lower degree of social assimilation was significantly associated with a higher risk of suicide in the Atayal and the male groups. In multivariable regression analysis, a significant effect of low social assimilation on the risk of suicide was found in Atayal and in men, even after controlling for the effects of ICD-10 depressive episode and emotionally unstable personality disorder. Meanwhile, there was a significant trend across low, moderate and high social assimilation on suicide risk in Atayal and in men.
   Conclusions. For the native Taiwanese, the stress from rapid acculturation into the main Chinese society is crucial to their mental health, It might be reduced through targeted social and educational programmes.

AB Background: As part of the expansive overhaul of the mental health system that occurred in the latter half of the 20th Century, many states passed laws that allow, under certain conditions, voluntary and involuntarily committed patients to refuse medication. While some predicted the consequences of these laws would be dire, the effect on violent behavior remains untested. Aims of the Study: The aim is to decipher any differences state right to refuse medication laws may have on violence.
   Method: Using the homicide rate of every US state between 1972 and 2001 (N = 1,479), and the suicide rate between 1981 and 2001 (N = 1,071). The study compares the difference in homicide/suicide rates before and after a law change to that same difference in a set of control states to estimate the effect of laws aimed at extending the right to refuse medication to both voluntary and involuntarily committed mental health patients.
   Results: Laws designed to allow voluntarily committed patients to refuse medication are associated with a 0.8 increase in homicides per 100,000 of the state population while laws dictating an involuntarily committed patient's right to request refusal of medication are negative but statistically insignificant using standard t test. Laws designed to allow voluntarily committed patients to refuse medication have no statistically significant effect on suicides while laws dictating an involuntarily committed patient's right to request refusal of medication, specifically when the request is reviewed by independent mental health professionals, are associated with a statistically significant reduction in suicides.
   Implications for Health Policies: Allowing voluntarily committed patients to refuse medication may entice some to enter in-patient facilities, but the brief and optional exposure to medication and their side effects may actually discourage treatment and increase violence.

AB The current paper provides a comprehensive research review of gender differences in rates of and risk factors for adolescent suicidal behavior in four main U.S cultural subgroups: African Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans. and Latino Americans. The paper highlights substantial findings from the most recent literature and provides direction for future research and clinical work. The data presented suggest that clinicians and interventionists relying on nonfatal expressions of suicide will continue to fail to identify adolescent males at risk for suicide. as females are more likely to report suicide ideation and attempts across all cultural groups reviewed. We conclude that researchers and clinicians should utilize indirect, broad measures of suicide proneness, as opposed to the traditional direct self-report tools. Although past research has examined cultural and gender differences in risk factors for suicidal behavior, these investigations have been primarily isolated from each other. Therefore, we sought to examine adolescent suicidal behavior and how it operates as a function of both gender and culture. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Despite the ubiquity of firearms in American homes, and the abundance of evidence linking access to firearms at home with the risk Of Suicide by firearm, information oil consumer product safety issues and policies, such as placement of triggers locks, that may protect household members against risk of suicide by firearm is Conspicuously sparse. Here we report results from the first study to estimate the protective effect of storing firearms locked and/or unloaded (i.e., safer storage practices). We analyzed data from the latest National Mortality Followback Survey (1993 NMFS), a nationally representative survey of next-of-kin of 22,957 decedents representing 2.2 million individuals. In our analysis we partially control for respondents' intention to die and focus on suicides that are likely to have been impulsive. Relative to decedents who did not practice safer storage of firearms, risk of suicide by firearms was less 67% among those who store their firearms locked and/or unloaded. Our findings Strongly Support the utility of consumer product safety devices and regulations intended to reduce the likelihood Of unauthorized or impulsive use of firearms.

AB From the epidemic perspective, suicide appears as an international public health problem due to the remarkable increase of its incidence. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in the year 2000, suicide had the greater percentage (49%) in the statistics of "deaths by intentional injuries"; followed by violence (32%) and war (19%).
   This source also notifies that in countries with population over 100 millions, Mexico is the country that shows the higher increase of "changes in age-standardized groups in specific intervals of time" (+61, 9% in period 81-83/93-95). Followed in descendent order by: India (+54%, period 80-93), Brazil (+13.2%, period 79-81/93-93), and the Russian Federation (+5.3%, period 80-82/96-98). The United States of America (-5.3%, period 80-82/93-97) and Japan (-14.3%, period 80-82/95-97) have shown decreasing rates.
   The increase in the rates of suicide in Mexico has been registered by various studies, which also have proved that the States where those rates were the highest are: Veracruz, Mexico City and, in third place, Guanajuato.
   Some specific sectors of Guanajuato State show an association of two phenomena: suicide and migration, basically migrants travelling to the United States of America and Canada, both countries with a high frequency of suicides. The information on suicide in Mexico come from sources such as local or international studies, and also from reports obtained through public institutions, the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica, Geografia e Informatica (INEGI), the Secreteria de Salud (SS) and the Procuraduria General de Justicia (PGJ). Nevertheless, the data given by these institutions show discrepancies in statistics, a fact due perhaps to differences in the classification criteria for deaths, and to registration and filing mistakes.
   The aim of the present research was to collect and report epidemiological data on suicides and the characteristics of the suicidal events, in the State of Guanajuato, during the period between 1995 and 2001. To this purpose the files of the PGJ in Guanajuato State were analyzed; these files contain detailed information about suicides and the suicidal act, as well as the transcription of suicidal notes, in case they be left. They also contain declarations and testimonies from people who are close (relatives, friends, acquaintances) to the suicidal victim.
   The data gathered included socio-demographical information, migrant condition, variables related to the Suicidal act, alcohol and drug use at the moment of the event, and the transcription of the suicidal note. The declarations and testimonies from the suicide acquaintances were kept for further studies.
   The data-gathering lasted six months and was made by last semester students of the Faculty of Psychology.
   Data were analyzed according to the State distribution Of the PGJ that divides it into 4 zones: Leon, Irapuato, Celaya and San Miguel de Allende. Frequency analysis were made and for some variables, chi square statistical tests.
   Of the 747 cases of death caused by suicide registered by the PGJ in Guanajuato, during the 1995 - 2001 period, 733 were analyzed because the lacking 13 files Could not be located. From the total of cases 80.1% were men and 19.9%, women. The rank of age goes from 8 to 9 1 years. The average for men was 30 years and the mode 20 years; for women the average was 28 wars and the mode 18 years old. This shows that Suicide was committed at,an earlier age by women than by men.
   Only 10% of the whole had no schooling; almost half of the total had completed elementary Studies and 21% had attained high school level. Besides, 30% of the people who committed suicide were employees and only 1.6% were professionals.
   Regarding the characteristics of the suicidal act, the place more used to committ it, was the suicide's house (78%), mainly in the case of women (with significant difference) (p=.001). The suicide method used in most cases was different for both sexes: men preferred hanging (p=.001), and women poisoning (p=.001).
   Forty one per cent of the men had ingested alcohol before committing suicide and only 7.8% of the women. In addition, alcohol use was more frequent in the group of 35 to 44 years of age, and by those who were married. The use of other drugs was present in 13% of the total (no significant differences between sexes).
   As to the migration phenomenon, most of migrant suicides were between 20 and 34 years old. The rate of non-migrant suicides was 4:1 (4 men committed suicide for every suicidal women) and it changed in the migrant group to 3:2. This migration phenomenon is data included: returning migrants, people who were going to leave Mexico in the near future (one day or week later) and also people who had one or more close relatives living as migrant laborers in the northern countries.
   Finally, other differences found when comparing the migrant group with the non-migrants Suicidal group are: the greater use of firearms registered as suicidal method (p=.001) and the higher percentage of psychiatric medication.
   On the other hand, the higher frequency Of Suicides was registered in the month of May (13%), and the lower percentage in October (5.7%).
   State regionalization, showed the higher percentage of suicides in Celaya (254 cases), and the lower corresponded to San Miguel de Allende (103 cases).
   It may be concluded that in the State Of Guanajuato the phenomenon of suicide presents alarming peculiarities: more risked groups include children, adolescents and Young people (this sample found 42 suicidal children under 14 years old).
   Also, considering that migration is the most important social phenomenon in Guanajuato State, we may observe that it has contributed to modify the patterns Of Suicide of some population groups. This is shown by the increasing suicidal women percentage and the most frequent use of firearms, drug and alcohol usage, and psychiatric medication; a possible explanation to this has to do with the Cultural shock of the migration process.
   Although it is difficult to consider the suicidal phenomenon as a consequence of drug abuse and vice versa, from the current frequency of suicide cases involved with drugs, at least at the moment of death, we may observe that this circumstance increases the complexity and difficulty, of the suicide problem.
   Finally, we may stress that obtaining information through the files of the PGJ demonstrated to be fruitful, because they have important elements to consider in the suicide research. Data as the transcription Of suicide notes, the declaration of relatives or close friends of the suicide, and the detailed description of the suicidal event, aren't registered by Other instances. Nevertheless, it is urgent to combine the efforts of the institutions related to the study of the suicidal behaviors, in order to systematize and to unify, the official statistics. This will optimize the registration forms and add some variables aimed to favor research purposes.

AB Previous research comparing rampage shooters in the U.S. and volunteer suicide bombers in the Middle East appears to be virtually non-existent. When these two types of suicidal killers have been mentioned in the same context, it has primarily been to dismiss any possible connections. Rampage shooters are generally assumed to be mentally unbalanced, while suicide bombers are seen as extreme, but rational, political actors. However, this review explores the possibility that the primary differences between the two types of killers are cultural, not individual, and that in terms of their underlying psychology and motivation, they are actually quite similar. In both cases, substantial evidence indicates that these perpetrators of murder-suicide share many of the following characteristics: (1) they had troubled childhoods, (2) they lived in oppressive social environments, (3) they suffered from low self-esteem, (4) they were triggered by a personal crisis, (5) they were seeking revenge, and (6) they were seeking fame and glory.

AB Background: Each year there are over 31,000 suicides in the United States, constituting a significant problem in every respect. It is important for research efforts to focus on the communication elements involved in suicide prevention because the messages produced by individuals close to those who have suicidal thoughts have the potential to save a life. Aims: The current manuscript presents the theory of planned behavior (TPB) as a foundation to increase understanding of what message content would be most effective to convince an individual to intervene when someone is suicidal. Methods: Suicide and suicidal behaviors are briefly reviewed, as is the TPB. Then it is argued how and why TPB can help construct persuasive messages. Results: The authors suggest that TPB guide the content of persuasive messages. Messages created in combination of persuasive theories with TPB are likely to encourage an individual to intervene when someone is suicidal. Conclusions: A key element to suicide prevention is intervention by close others. Use of TPB provides an increased understanding of how to persuade close individuals to intervene when an individual is suicidal.

AB Determining the relationship between gun ownership levels and firearm homicide rates is critical to inform public health policy. Previous research has shown that state-level gun ownership, as measured by a widely used proxy, is positively associated with firearm homicide rates. A newly developed proxy measure that incorporates the hunting license rate in addition to the proportion of firearm suicides correlates more highly with state-level gun ownership. To corroborate previous research, we used this new proxy to estimate the association of state-level gun ownership with total, firearm, and non-firearm homicides. Using state-specific data for the years 1981-2010, we modelled these rates as a function of gun ownership level, controlling for potential confounding factors. We used a negative binomial regression model and accounted for clustering of observations among states. We found that state-level gun ownership as measured by the new proxy, is significantly associated with firearm and total homicides but not with non-firearm homicides.

AB OBJECTIVE: We asked whether adoption status represented a risk of suicide attempt for adopted and nonadopted offspring living in the United States. We also examined whether factors known to be associated with suicidal behavior would mediate the relationship between adoption status and suicide attempt.
   METHODS: Participants were drawn from the Sibling Interaction and Behavior Study, which included 692 adopted and 540 nonadopted offspring and was conducted at the University of Minnesota from 1998 to 2008. Adoptees were systematically ascertained from records of 3 large Minnesota adoption agencies; nonadoptees were ascertained from Minnesota birth records. Outcome measures were attempted suicide, reported by parent or offspring, and factors known to be associated with suicidal behavior including psychiatric disorder symptoms, personality traits, family environment, and academic disengagement.
   RESULTS: The odds of a reported suicide attempt were similar to 4 times greater in adoptees compared with nonadoptees (odds ratio: 4.23). After adjustment for factors associated with suicidal behavior, the odds of reporting a suicide attempt were reduced but remained significantly elevated (odds ratio: 3.70).
   CONCLUSIONS: The odds for reported suicide attempt are elevated in individuals who are adopted relative to those who are not adopted. The relationship between adoption status and suicide attempt is partially mediated by factors known to be associated with suicidal behavior. Continued study of the risk of suicide attempt in adopted offspring may inform the larger investigation of suicidality in all adolescents and young adults.

AB To develop and refine interventions to prevent youth suicide, knowledge is needed about specific processes that reduce risk at a population level. Using a cross-sectional design, the present study tested hypotheses regarding associations between self-reported suicide attempts, emotion regulation difficulties, and positive youth-adult relationships among 7,978 high-school students (48.6 % male, 49.9 % female) in 30 high schools from predominantly rural, low-income communities. 683 students (8.6 %) reported a past-year suicide attempt. Emotion regulation difficulties and a lack of trusted adults at home and school were associated with increased risk for making a past-year suicide attempt, above and beyond the effects of depressive symptoms and demographic factors. The association between emotion regulation difficulties and suicide attempts was modestly lower among students who perceived themselves as having higher levels of trusted adults in the family, consistent with a protective effect. Having a trusted adult in the community (outside of school and family) was associated with fewer suicide attempts in models that controlled only for demographic covariates, but not when taking symptoms of depression into account. These findings point to adolescent emotion regulation and relationships with trusted adults as complementary targets for suicide prevention that merit further intervention studies. Reaching these targets in a broad population of adolescents will require new delivery systems and "option rich" (OR) intervention designs.

AB Objective: Over 30,000 people a year commit suicide in the United States. Prior attempted suicide and hopelessness are the most powerful clinical predictors of future completed suicide. The authors hypothesized that "reasons for living" might protect or restrain patients with major depression from making a suicide attempt.
   Method: Inpatients with DSM-III-R major depression were assessed for depression, general psychopathology, suicide history, reasons for living, and hopelessness. Of the 84 patients, 45 had attempted suicide and 39 had not.
   Results: The depressed patients who had not attempted suicide expressed more feelings of responsibility toward family, more fear of social disapproval, more moral objections to suicide, greater survival and coping skills, and a greater fear of suicide than the depressed patients who had attempted suicide. Scores for hopelessness, subjective depression, and suicidal ideation were significantly higher for the suicide attempters. Reasons for living correlated inversely with the combined score on these measures, considered an indicator of "clinical suicidality." Neither objective severity of depression nor quantity of recent life events differed between the two groups.
   Conclusions: During a depressive episode, the subjective perception of stressful life events may be more germane to suicidal expression than the objective quantity of such events. A more optimistic perceptual set, despite equivalent objective severity of depression, may modify hopelessness and may protect against suicidal behavior during periods of risk, such as major depression. Assessment of reasons for living should be included in the evaluation of suicidal patients.

AB Background and aimsTobacco use may be a risk factor for suicide mortality; however, prior research has produced equivocal findings and has been limited by relatively small sample sizes to study the rare event of suicide, as well as a lack of adjustment for other important factors, including psychiatric illness. We estimate the predictive association between tobacco use disorder and the risk of suicide mortality, adjusting for other important variables.
   DesignA prospective cohort study.
   SettingThe United States Veterans Health Administration (VHA).
   ParticipantsAll individuals who received VHA services in fiscal year (FY) 2005 and were alive at the start of FY 2006 (n=4863086).
   MeasurementsTobacco use disorder was assessed via FYs 2004-05 VHA National Patient Care Database records. The outcome of suicide mortality was assessed during the follow-up interval from the beginning of FY 2006 to the end of FY 2008 using National Death Index records.
   FindingsOf the 4863086 individuals in the study, 4823 died by suicide during the follow-up interval. In the unadjusted model, tobacco use disorder was associated with an increased risk of suicide [hazard ratio (HR)=1.88; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.76, 2.02]. After adjustment for model covariates, the association remained statistically significant, although attenuated (HR=1.36, 95% CI=1.27, 1.46).
   ConclusionsTobacco use disorder may confer a modest excess risk of death by suicide. Psychiatric disorders may partially explain the relationship between tobacco use disorder and suicide.

AB This investigation explored suicide-related characteristics and help-seeking behavior by sexual orientation. Population-based data are from the California Quality of Life Surveys, which included 1,478 sexual minority (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and homosexually experienced individuals) and 3,465 heterosexual individuals. Bisexual women had a nearly six-fold increased risk of lifetime suicide attempts than heterosexual women (RR = 5.88, 95%CI: 3.89-8.90), and homosexually experienced men had almost 7 times higher risk of lifetime suicide attempts than heterosexual men (RR = 6.93, 95%CI: 3.65-13.15). Sexual minority men and women were more likely than heterosexual men and women to have disclosed suicide attempts to a medical professional (RR = 1.48 and RR = 1.44, respectively). Among persons who ever attempted suicide, sexual minority women had a younger age of index attempt than heterosexual women (15.9 vs. 19.6 years of age, respectively). Healthcare professionals should be aware of suicidal risk heterogeneity among sexual minority individuals, including vulnerable points of risk and evidenced-based treatments.

AB Objective: Suicide attempts are prevalent in association with major mood disorders, and risk is greater with bipolar disorder (BD) than major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults. There may be similar relationships in juvenile mood disorders, but the evidence has not been compiled systematically and quantitatively.
   Method: We searched for reports of studies comparing rates of suicide attempts in children or adolescents diagnosed with BD or MDD, and applied random-effects meta-analysis.
   Results: In 6 reports from 1995 to 2017, with 2,303 participants diagnosed with mood disorder from the United States and South Korea, aged 3 to 18 years, rates of suicide attempts differed significantly by diagnosis: BD (31.5%) > MDD (20.5%) > hypomania or mania-only (8.49%). Risk of suicide attempts differed (BD > MDD) highly significantly by meta -analysis (odds ratio [OR] = 1.71, CI = 1.33-2.20, p <.0001), and was very similar if a study with attempts and suicidal ideation was excluded (OR = 1.64, CI = 1.26-2.15, p <.0001).
   Conclusion: Risk of suicide attempts in juvenile mood disorder patients ranked: BD > MDD >> hypomania or mania -only >> juvenile general population.

ID WASHINGTON-STATE; REQUESTS; DEATH
AB Background: The practices of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide remain controversial.
   Objective: To achieve better understanding of attitudes and practices regarding euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in the context of end-of-life care.
   Design: Cohort study.
   Setting: United States.
   Participants: 3299 oncologists who are members of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
   Measurements: Responses to survey questions on attitudes toward euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide for a terminally ill patient with prostate cancer who has unremitting pain, requests for and performance of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, and sociodemographic characteristics.
   Results: Of U.S. oncologists surveyed, 22.5% supported the use of physician-assisted suicide for a terminally ill patient with unremitting pain and 6.5% supported euthanasia Oncologists who were reluctant to increase the dose of intravenous morphine for terminally ill patients in excruciating pain (odds ratio [OR], 0.61 [95% CI, 0.48 to 0.77]) and had sufficient time to talk to dying patients about end-of-life care issues (OR, 0.79 [CI, 0.71 to 0.87]) were less likely to support euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. During their career, 3.7% of surveyed oncologists had performed euthanasia and 10.8% had performed physician-assisted suicide. Oncologists who were reluctant to increase the morphine dose for patients in excruciating pain (OR, 0.58 [CI, 0.43 to 0.79]) and those who believed that they had received adequate training in end-of-life care (OR, 0.86 [CI, 0.79 to 0.95]) were less likely to have performed euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. Oncologists who reported not being able to obtain all the care that a dying patient needed were more likely to have performed euthanasia (P = 0.001).
   Conclusions: Requests for euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are likely to decrease as training in end-of-life care improves and the ability of physicians to provide this care to their patients is enhanced.

AB Objective: Duration of insomnia symptoms and nightmares are related to suicidal risk in young adults independent of current symptoms of insomnia, nightmares, anxiety, depression, and PTSD. However, this relation has yet to be examined among older adults, despite older adults being at higher risk of suicidal behavior. Further, the current study aims to replicate previous research among younger adults showing that insomnia symptoms and nightmares are associated with suicide risk independent of the interpersonal psychological theory of suicide (IPTS).
   Methods: The present study utilized 167 participants age 55 and older obtained by combining two independent mTurk data collections of adults in the United States.
   Results: In the current sample, duration of nightmares was associated with suicide risk in older adults independent of symptoms of current insomnia and nightmares, duration of insomnia, and symptoms of PTSD, anhedonia, and the IPTS.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the duration of nightmares (i.e., how long someone has been experiencing nightmares) predict substantial variance in suicide risk among older adults in addition to the risk factors typically examined. Thus, assessment of sleep dysfunction is important when assessing suicide risk among older adults.

ID UNITED-STATES; MILITARY; PERSONNEL; DEATH
AB Objective: To measure indirectly standardized active duty Air Force (ADAF) suicide rates. Methods: The study period was 1990-2004. ADAF suicide deaths were obtained from the Air Force Mortality Registry. ADAF population counts were obtained from the Defense Manpower and Data Center. Suicide rates for the U.S. general population were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics. Results: The standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), adjusted for age, gender, and race, were: all enlisted personnel, 0.64(95% Cl: 0.59-0.69) and all officers, 0.14(95% CI: 0.10-0.20). Adjusted for age and race, the SMRs were: enlisted men, 0.63 (95% CI: 0.58-0.68); enlisted women, 0.95 (95% Cl: 0.66-1.33); officer men, 0.12 (95% Cl: 0.08-0.17); and officer women, 0.67 (95% Cl: 0.27-1.36). Conclusions: There were significant deficits of suicides in overall enlisted personnel and in overall officers. When analyzed further by gender and rank, there were significant deficits only in enlisted men and officer men. Suicide mortality in enlisted and officer women was not significantly less compared to their general population counterparts.

AB American Indian (AI) youth have some of the highest rates of suicide of any group in the United States, and the majority of AI youth live in urban areas away from tribal communities. As such, understanding the resources available for suicide prevention among urban AI youth is critical, as is understanding the challenges involved in accessing such resources. Pre-existing interview data from 15 self-identified AI community members and staff from an Urban Indian Health Organization were examined to understand existing resources for urban AI youth suicide prevention, as well as related challenges. A thematic analysis was undertaken, resulting in three principal themes around suicide prevention: formal resources, informal resources, and community values and beliefs. Formal resources that meet the needs of AI youth were viewed as largely inaccessible or nonexistent, and youth were seen as more likely to seek help from informal sources. Community values of mutual support were thought to reinforce available informal supports. However, challenges arose in terms of the community's knowledge of and views on discussing suicide, as well as the perceived fit between community values and beliefs and formal prevention models.

AB Objective: A qualitative study among Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) Soldiers was conducted to explore potential constructs underlying suicide according to the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide (IPTS); these include burdensomeness, failed belonging, and acquired capability. Methods: Qualitative semistructured interviews were conducted with 68 Soldiers at 3 months post-OEF/OIF deployment. Soldiers were asked about changes in their experiences of pain, burdensomeness, and lack of belonging. The methodology employed was descriptive phenomenological. Results: Transcripts were reviewed and themes related to the IPTS constructs emerged. Soldiers' postdeployment transition experiences included higher pain tolerance, chronic pain, emotional reactivity, emotional numbing and distancing, changes in physical functioning, combat guilt, discomfort with care seeking, and difficulties reintegrating into family and society. Conclusions: Findings highlight the utility of the IPTS in understanding precursors to suicide associated with transition from deployment, as well as treatment strategies that may reduce risk in Soldiers during reintegration.

AB Recent findings indicate a relationship between anxiety sensitivity (AS) and suicide in a variety of populations in the United States. However, the link between AS and suicide has not been evaluated in other cultures. Suicide rates in Russia are among the highest worldwide making it an excellent choice to evaluate the cross-cultural robustness of these findings. The current investigation sought to replicate and extend the investigation of AS subfactors (i.e., cognitive, physical, and their interaction) in relation to suicidality in a sample of Russian adults. Participants were 390 adults recruited from Moscow using a geographic sampling method. Findings from the current study indicate that the interaction of AS cognitive concerns and AS physical concerns are associated with elevated rates of suicidality and previous suicide attempt, above and beyond negative affectivity and hazardous alcohol use. Clinicians may benefit from implementing AS reduction strategies with individuals who endorse elevated suicide risk as well as elevated AS cognitive concerns and low AS physical concerns.

TI A National Comparison of Suicide Among Medicaid and Non-Medicaid Youth
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; CHILD; MALTREATMENT; PREVENTION; ABUSE
AB Introduction: In the U.S., youth enrolled in Medicaid experience more risk factors for suicide, such as mental illness, than youth not enrolled in Medicaid. To inform a national suicide prevention strategy, this study presents suicide rates in a sample of youth enrolled in Medicaid and compares them with rates in the non-Medicaid population.
   Methods: Data sources were death certificate data matched with Medicaid data from 16 states, and the Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System. Deaths by suicide that occurred between 2009 and 2013 by youth aged 10 to 18 years were identified for Medicaid and non-Medicaid groups. Age-, gender-, and cause-specific mortality rates were calculated separately for both groups. Standardized mortality ratios were calculated to compare rates, and standardized mortality ratio 95% CIs were estimated with Poisson regressions. The data were analyzed in 2018.
   Results: A substantial proportion (39%) of the total number of deaths by suicide (N=4,045) in youth occurred among those enrolled in Medicaid. The overall suicide rate did not significantly differ between groups (standardized mortality ratio=0.96, 95% CI=0.90, 1.03). However, compared with the non-Medicaid group, the suicide rate in the Medicaid group was significantly higher among youth aged 10 to 14 years (standardized mortality ratio=1.28, 95% CI=1.11, 1.47), females (regardless of age; standardized mortality ratio=1.14, 95% CI=1.01, 1.29), and those who died by hanging (standardized mortality ratio=1.26, 95% CI=1.16, 1.38).
   Conclusions: The population-based profile of suicide among youth enrolled in Medicaid differs from the profile of youth not enrolled in Medicaid, confirming the importance of Medicaid as a "boundaried" suicide prevention setting.

DT Article
DE Suicide prevention; Interorganizational collaboration; Social network
   analysis; Tie strength; Community safety net
ID SOCIAL-STRUCTURE; TRUST
AB One explanation for the continued high rates of suicide in the United States may be insufficient coordination between organizations involved in prevention. Therefore, the factors that promote interorganizational collaboration should be identified and fostered. Surveys were administered to 37 organizations involved in suicide prevention in one Colorado community to: (1) assess the nature of collaboration and (2) identify relationship strength indicators associated with different types of collaboration. Results were examined using social network and regression analyses. Organizations reported more sharing information and resources and sending and receiving referrals than developing service infrastructure and coordinating training and screening activities. Some types of organizations were more connected than others, and the influence of relationship strength indicators was mostly consistent across different types of collaboration. This study offers new insight into the structural and relational aspects of interorganizational collaboration in suicide prevention and may serve as a model to better understand networks within other community health settings.

AB Objectives: Fatal and nonfatal suicide attempts are far more common in opioid-dependent individuals than in the general population. More research is needed to understand the specific risk factors for suicidal behaviors in this patient population, particularly outside of the United States and Western Europe. This study investigated the correlates of suicide attempts among Polish patients in methadone maintenance treatment and interpreted results in the context of findings from other countries.
   Methods: The study was based on a sample of 240 individuals recruited from a methadone maintenance clinic in Poland. Participants were interviewed using standardized measures.
   Results: Consistent with studies in other countries, sexual abuse, depression, alcohol dependence, and impulsivity were associated with suicide attempt. Additionally, those patients with somatic comorbidity had an increase in odds (odds ratio = 2.6) of suicide attempt.
   Conclusions: The results of our study suggest a potential benefit to treatment approaches that address somatic concerns of methadone-maintenance patients. More research is needed to identify, assess, and understand possible cultural and regional differences between opioid-dependent populations to better tailor prevention strategies.

AB ObjectivesSuicide is a major global public health problem and much burden in the societies. This study aims to calculate the years of life lost (YLL) due to suicide and investigate its trend in Iran.MethodsInformation on deaths due to suicide in Iran was extracted from Iran Legal Medicine Organization. The years of life lost was calculated in each year according to gender and age-groups. To examine the trend for different years, joinpoint regression was used.ResultsThe 35,297 deaths due to suicide were recorded in 2006-2015. The total YLL in the 10-year period was 34.52 per 1000 persons in males, 13.61 per 1000 persons in females and 23.35 per 1000 persons in both sexes. Hanging comprised the largest YLL of suicide. The annual percent change of YLL rate was 3.3%.ConclusionsThe results revealed that male shows an increasing trend in YLL specifically among youth and adult, while there is no improvement in females. There is a national need to implement an effective health policy intervention in Iran.

SO DEATH STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; HEALTH; LIFE; MORTALITY; SATISFACTION; VALUES; RISK
AB Suicide as a cause of death among adolescents and migration as a component of population have been growing in importance. Very little research has been conducted on the connections between migration and suicidality among adolescents in Hong Kong, and so is the aim of this article. It uses census and registration data to study suicide mortality, and sample survey data collected for this purpose to investigate suicide attempt, suicide ideation, and self-injurious behavior. Relations between suicidality and socio-demographic/psychological factors replicated those found in the literature. Duration Of residence was found important for the study of suicide among migrants. In both the bivariate and multivariate analyses, although the suicidality levels for short-duration (less than 10 years) adolescent migrants were very much lower than the local-born counterparts, those for the long-duration (10 years or more) migrants were very much higher. The findings support the Healthy Migrant Hypothesis and other related hypotheses in migrant mortality studies. They also reveal, in the light of the Integration Theory of Suicide, the problem of migrant integration into the host culture and society, an important social problem for the government to solve.

TI The associations among personality disorder symptoms, suicide proneness

SO PERSONALITY AND MENTAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID LIFE ATTITUDES SCHEDULE; SCALE
AB Suicide is the 11th leading cause of death in the United States, and the third leading cause of death in US jails and penitentiaries. Research has shown that the presence of an Axis II personality disorder (PD) increases the risk for suicidal behaviour. While many correctional institutions screen inmates for suicidal ideation upon intake, they can neglect to assess for the presence of PD symptoms other than those associated with criminality such as Antisocial PD. The current study examined whether symptoms of various PDs were associated with self-reports of current suicide proneness and distress in a small sample of adult male inmates residing in a medium or a maximum security facility. As hypothesized, elevated scores on numerous PD Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III scales (e. g. Schizoid, Depressive, Sadistic, Schizotypal, Borderline) were significantly associated with both self-reports of current suicide proneness and psychological distress. Once the nature of these associations in inmates is better understood, more effective suicide prevention programs can be designed and implemented in correctional facilities.

AB Suicide is a complex phenomenon associated with psychological, biological, and social factors, claiming approximately 30,000 lives each year in the United States. We retrospectively reviewed all cases referred to the Medical Examiners' Office/Forensic Pathology Section at the Medical University of South Carolina from January 1988 to December 1997. The cases of suicide totaled 678. All of the cases were analyzed as to age/race/sex, method of suicide, time of year, and toxicological results. Files were also reviewed to determine if the victim left behind a suicide note. The ages ranged from 12 to 94 years; males comprised 79.5% of the victims, and whites 78.3%. The male to female and white to black ratios were both 3.9:1. The most common methods were gunshot wounds, accounting for 64.6% of the cases. No correlation existed with time of year, and the number of cases was not increased around major holidays. The group of victims 65 years and older and the pediatric group under the age of 18 were also examined separately.

   intervention services
AB The United States has become a country that is constantly at war. This situation has created a crisis amongst our veterans. The current uneven access to appropriate mental health services that returning U.S. veterans encounter echoes the disparities in access to quality mental health services for the general population. The information presented here shows that the shortcomings of our health care system in addressing the mental health needs for our returning veterans may lead to the high suicide rates. Addressing the problem of inadequate access to quality mental health services is critical in any efforts to reforming the U.S. health care system. Our findings suggest that mental health disparities are often a leading factor to the high suicide rates among veterans who experience depression and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. To improve the health and well-being of our veterans who have served this nation, requires a collaboration between public and non-profit mental health providers at the State and local levels. It is imperative that we increase the availability of crisis intervention and mental health services for all veterans that have served this nation.

AB Familicide refers to the killing of multiple family members, most commonly the homicide of an intimate partner and at least one child. This study examines the prevalence of familicide in the United States. Second, it explores the relationship between the prevalence of familicide and the prevalence of financial problems in the United States by making use of Supplementary Homicide Reports data and newspaper reports. In the period of 2000-2009, familicide involving an intimate partner and child(ren) occurred approximately 23 times per year. The majority of the perpetrators were male, who committed the offense with a firearm. Familicides involving an intimate partner and child(ren) with financial motives alone occurred 4 to 5 times per year. The results showed that the association between familicide and financial problems is not a straightforward one. Even though correlational analyses suggest a relationship between the two, the prevalence of familicide motivated by financial problems was unrelated to periods of financial downfall. Directions for future research are discussed.

AB Background: Socioculturally meaningful events have been shown to influence the timing of suicide, but the influence of psychiatric disorder on these associations has seldom been studied. Aims: To investigate the association between birthday and increased risk of suicide in the general population and in a national sample of psychiatric patients. Methods: Data on general population suicides and suicide by individuals in recent care of mental health services were examined for day of death in relation to one's birthday using Poisson regression analysis. Results: An increased risk of suicide was observed on day of one's birthday itself for males in both the general population (IRR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.18-1.64, p < .01) and the clinical population (IRR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.07-2.07, p = .03), especially for those aged 35 years and older. In the clinical population, risk was restricted to male patients aged 35-54 and risk extended to the 3 days prior to one's birthday. Conclusions: Birthdays are periods of increased risk for men aged 35 and older in the general population and in those receiving mental health care. Raising health-care professionals' awareness of patient groups at greater risk at this personally significant time may benefit care planning and could facilitate suicide prevention in these individuals.

AB Background: Whereas firearm suicide mortality has been a longstanding public concern worldwide, in Greece no systematic analysis has been reported so far despite the recent evidence of a rising rate of gun ownership. Aims: To estimate the proportion of firearm suicides on the island of Crete, Southern Greece, well-known for its widespread gun ownership; to describe the victims' sociodemographic profile and firearm-related suicide variables; and to assess the severity of suicidal intention in the group. Methods: Records of suicides between 1999 and 2007 were reviewed and information was extracted into a computerized database. A rating of the circumstances section of the Beck's Suicide Intent Scale (SIS) for each case was also performed. Results: The firearm suicide rate was 1.3 per 100,000, with males constituting the vast majority. These men were more likely to be less than 55 years of age, to have lived in the western part of the island, to have some degree of planning prior to the suicidal act, and to have used a shotgun, but less likely to have left a note. Conclusions: As an important first step toward implementing preventive initiatives the authors stress the need for a thorough look at the sociocultural factors associated with firearms in the region.

AB Suicide rates are higher among those who own or live in a household with a hand gun. This article examines the association between hand gun ownership and mental health, another risk factor for suicide. Data from the General Social Survey, a series of surveys of U. S. adults, are analyzed to compare general emotional and mental health, sadness and depression, functional mental health, and mental health help seeking among gun owners, persons who do not own but live in a household with a gun, and those who do not own a gun. After taking into account a few basic demographic characteristics associated with both variables, there appears to be no association between mental health and gun ownership. Nor is there any association between mental health and living in a household with a firearm. Findings suggest that the high risk of suicide among those who own or live in a household with a gun is not related to poor mental health. Implications for prevention are discussed.

AB The goal of this study was to describe the relative utility of the terms means safety versus means restriction in counseling individuals to limit their access to firearms in the context of a mock suicide risk assessment. Overall, 370 participants were randomized to read a vignette depicting a clinical scenario in which managing firearm ownership and access was discussed either using the term means safety or means restriction. Participants rated the term means safety as significantly more acceptable and preferable than means restriction. Participants randomized to the means safety condition reported greater intentions to adhere to clinicians' recommendations to limit access to a firearm for safety purposes (F[1,367]=7.393, p=.007, eta(2)(p) = .020). The term means safety may be more advantageous than means restriction when discussing firearm ownership and access in clinical settings and public health-oriented suicide prevention efforts.

AB Suicide is the third leading cause of death for youths aged 15 to 24 years in the United States. Approximately 2 million US adolescents attempt suicide each year, and 19% report serious consideration of suicide in the past year. Although suicidal adolescents are frequently treated in emergency departments (EDs), there are few publications about their ED management. Therefore, we reviewed the literature for recommendations for the management of adolescents with suicidal ideation or attempts. Hospitalization is recommended for adolescents who have attempted suicide and cannot be adequately monitored and kept safe outside of an inpatient setting. Discharge home can be considered for a subset of adolescents with suicidal thoughts if urgent follow up mental health care can be ensured and responsible caregivers can adequately supervise and protect the youth. This subset includes adolescents who are not, actively suicidal, do not have access to lethal methods, and have a supervising adult who can closely monitor their behavior. A mental health evaluation is recommended before ED discharge whenever feasible.

   VIOLENCE; REGULATIONS; PREVENTION; TRENDS
AB Importance: Over 30 000 people die annually in the United States from injuries caused by firearms. Although most firearm laws are enacted by states, whether the laws are associated with rates of firearm deaths is uncertain.
   Objective: To evaluate whether more firearm laws in a state are associated with fewer firearm fatalities.
   Design: Using an ecological and cross-sectional method, we retrospectively analyzed all firearm-related deaths reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System from 2007 through 2010. We used state-level firearm legislation across 5 categories of laws to create a "legislative strength score," and measured the association of the score with state mortality rates using a clustered Poisson regression. States were divided into quartiles based on their score.
   Setting: Fifty US states.
   Participants: Populations of all US states.
   Main Outcome Measures: The outcome measures were state-level firearm-related fatalities per 100 000 individuals per year overall, for suicide, and for homicide. In various models, we controlled for age, sex, race/ethnicity, poverty, unemployment, college education, population density, nonfirearm violence-related deaths, and household firearm ownership.
   Results: Over the 4-year study period, there were 121 084 firearm fatalities. The average state-based firearm fatality rates varied from a high of 17.9 (Louisiana) to a low of 2.9 (Hawaii) per 100 000 individuals per year. Annual firearm legislative strength scores ranged from 0 (Utah) to 24 (Massachusetts) of 28 possible points. States in the highest quartile of legislative strength (scores of >= 9) had a lower overall firearm fatality rate than those in the lowest quartile (scores of <= 2) (absolute rate difference, 6.64 deaths/100 000/y; age-adjusted incident rate ratio [IRR], 0.58; 95% CI, 0.37-0.92). Compared with the quartile of states with the fewest laws, the quartile with the most laws had a lower firearm suicide rate (absolute rate difference, 6.25 deaths/100 000/y; IRR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.48-0.83) and a lower firearm homicide rate (absolute rate difference, 0.40 deaths/100 000/y; IRR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.38-0.95).
   Conclusions and Relevance: A higher number of firearm laws in a state are associated with a lower rate of firearm fatalities in the state, overall and for suicides and homicides individually. As our study could not determine cause-and-effect relationships, further studies are necessary to define the nature of this association.

AB Suicide is a major public health problem, accounting for roughly 1,000,000 annual deaths worldwide, many of which are thought to be a result of bipolar disorders. Furthermore, bipolar disorders show an average of a 10 year period between onset of symptoms and clinical diagnosis. The high risk of suicide in bipolar disorders, combined with the difficulties in establishing the diagnosis, make this disorder particularly dangerous: patients with unrecognized bipolar disorder are four times more likely to complete suicide. A woman with undiagnosed bipolar disorder with a history of one prior attempt made a second attempt by means of ingesting roughly 32 grams of acetaminophen. While acetaminophen is used safely by millions, the compound is frequently the cause of intentional and unintentional acute liver failure, leading to 200 deaths in the United States annually. The combination of the availability and toxicity of acetaminophen and the risks associated with undiagnosed bipolar disorder led to a common and avoidable scenario that nearly resulted in patient mortality.

AB Suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are more common in Latina adolescents than White or African-American adolescents. Several health risk behaviors have been identified as being associated with Latina adolescent suicides. However, to date, no study has identified the consistency and stability of these risk behaviors over time. This study utilized the national Youth Risk Behaviors Survey from 2001 to 2013 to estimate the prevalence of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and health risk behaviors associated with suicidal behaviors in Latina adolescents. Our analysis found the prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts varied significantly over the 13-year study span, decreasing from 2001 to 2009 and increased from 2011 to 2013. The analyses found 11 health risk behaviors that were significantly associated with both suicidal ideation and suicide attempts that did not vary over time. The stability of these 11 health risk behaviors associated with suicidal behaviors could be useful to school personnel to identify early at risk Latina adolescents who may benefit from school and community mental health resources.

AB Background: Suicide is a public health concern, but little is known about the patterns of health care visits made before a suicide attempt, and whether those patterns differ by race/ethnicity.
   Objectives: To examine racial/ethnic variation in the types of health care visits made before a suicide attempt, when those visits occur, and whether mental health or substance use diagnoses were documented.
   Research Design: Retrospective, longitudinal study, 2009-2011.
   Participants: 22,387 individuals who attempted suicide and were enrolled in the health plan across 10 health systems in the Mental Health Research Network.
   Measures: Cumulative percentage of different types of health care visits made in the 52 weeks before a suicide attempt, by self-reported racial/ethnicity and diagnosis. Data were from the Virtual Data Warehouse at each site.
   Results: Over 38% of the individuals made any health care visit within the week before their suicide attempt and similar to 95% within the preceding year; these percentages varied across racial/ethnic groups (P < 0.001). White individuals had the highest percentage of visits (> 41%) within 1 week of suicide attempt. Asian Americans were the least likely to make visits within 52 weeks. Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders had proportionally the most inpatient and emergency visits before an attempt, but were least likely to have a recorded mental health or substance use diagnosis. Overall, visits were most common in primary care and outpatient general medical settings.
   Conclusions: This study provides temporal evidence of racial/ethnic differences in health care visits made before suicide attempt. Health care systems can use this information to help focus the design and implementation of their suicide prevention initiatives.

AB Background: Suicide is a problem of worldwide concern and research on possible protective factors is needed. We explored the role of social support as one such factor. Specifically, we hypothesized that increased social support would be associated with decreased likelihood of a lifetime suicide attempt in two nationally representative samples as well as a high-risk subsample.
   Methods: We analyzed the relationship between social support and lifetime history of a suicide attempt, controlling for a variety of related psychopathology and demographic variables, in the National Comorbidity Study Replication (NCS-R), a United States sample and the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Study (APMS), an English sample.
   Results: Results indicate that social support is associated with decreased likelihood of a lifetime suicide attempt controlling for a variety of related predictors in both the full US sample (OR=0.68, p < .001) and the full English sample (OR=0.93, p < .01).
   Limitations: The cross-sectional data do not allow true cause and effect analyses.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest social support is associated with decreased likelihood of a lifetime suicide attempt. Social support is a highly modifiable factor that can be used to improve existing suicide prevention programs worldwide. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,

AB Purpose: This study explores the experiences and adjustment process among older Bhutanese refugees resettled in the United States and identifies their unmet health and social service needs. Design: This phenomenological study design included the conduction of nine in-depth semistructured interviews in the respondents' native language. The researchers adhered to the steps outlined by Moustakas for data analysis. Results: The five identified themes included the following: a better life but with little sorrows, cultural tensions related to adaptation, language as a barrier to success in the United States, isolation and loneliness, and worries about citizenship and its impact on the future. Discussion/Implications for Practice: Psychological adjustment to life in the United States can have profound impact on the health of Bhutanese older adults. Nurses and health care providers should integrate culturally congruent health care, raise awareness of the unique needs, and advocate for policy changes that will benefit this group of older adult refugees whose lives have frequently been upended.

AB We examined differences in suicidality based on gender identity while adjusting for known suicide risk factors in a sample of United States adolescents. Using data from the 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Survey we used logistic regression models to examine three suicide-related outcomes. Youth were categorized as transgender (1.3%), gender-questioning (1.4%), or cisgender (97.3%). In fully adjusted models, compared to cisgender youth, transgender youth had 2.71 (95% CI 1.50-4.92) higher odds of past-year suicide attempts and 2.54 (95% CI 1.05-6.15) higher odds of past-year suicide attempts requiring treatment. Gender-questioning youth had 2.31 (95% CI 1.48-3.60) higher odds of past-year suicidal ideation compared to cisgender youth. Policies and interventions are needed to reduce suicidality among gender minority youth, improve access to mental healthcare, and reduce peer victimization and substance use.

AB To understand the mortality patterns among drug users and potential risk factors, we evaluated drug-related deaths reported to the Florida Medical Examiners Commission from 2001 to 2013, by substances, demographics, and manner of death. The annual drug-related fatalities increased by 57% from 2001 to 2013 (total n = 100,882); 51.8% were accidental, 7.9% homicide, 18.6% natural, and 19.6% suicide. The different manners of death exhibited distinct demographic profiles and drug composition. The gender gap was more prominent in homicide. Age >= 55 years was more closely associated with natural death and suicide. Age <35 years and central nervous system (CNS) stimulants including amphetamines and cocaine showed higher relative risks for accidental death and homicide, whereas CNS depressants including benzodiazepines, carisoprodol, opioids, and zolpidem were more strongly associated with accidental death and/ or suicide. The findings aid in identifying populations more vulnerable to drug-related deaths, developing targeted interventions and thereby improving efficiency of preventive efforts.

AB Suicide is a leading cause of death among men and women in the United States Military. Using a retrospective chart review design, the current study investigated gender differences on documented traumas for people admitted to a military inpatient psychiatric unit for suicide-related thoughts or behaviors (N = 656). Men more often had no documented lifetime traumas and women more often had 2 or more trauma types. Women had significantly more documented incidences of childhood sexual abuse, adulthood sexual assault, adulthood physical assault, and pregnancy loss. The gender gap in documented trauma types for childhood and adulthood traumas persisted even after adjusting for demographic variables, psychiatric diagnoses, and comorbid trauma types (i.e., trauma types other than the one being used as the dependent variable). Given the observed gender differences in documented traumas, professionals working with military women admitted for suicide-related thoughts or behaviors need to consider trauma in the context of treatment.

AB This paper presents a system for making decisions at the end of life. It emphasizes the role of patient autonomy and the importance of patient and family participation with the physician in decision-making. Definitions are presented for the terms: terminal illness, withholding and withdrawing life sustaining treatment, physician assisted suicide and euthanasia. Three cases are briefly described to illustrate the application of the decision-making system. A detailed discussion is then presented of the divergent views expressed by different authors about the moral differences or similarities between forgoing life sustaining treatment and physician assistance in dying. It is concluded that the view that these two actions are fundamentally different, as supported by the United States Supreme Court, in 1997, is the correct one. Physician assisted suicide (PAS) remains a controversial issue. Physicians and societies in individual countries must work out their own approaches to PAS. However, forgoing invasive or intensive life support in terminally ill patients consistent with their wishes is considered appropriate.

AB Objective: The study assessed the prevalence of suicidal ideation, suicide plans, and suicide attempts as well as patterns of mental health service use among adolescents. Methods: Data came from the National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement, a nationally representative sample of 10,123 adolescents aged 13 to 18 years who participated in computer-assisted, face-to-face interviews between February 2001 and January 2004. Prevalences of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in the past year were determined. Past-year use of any mental health treatment and receipt of four or more visits from one provider among youths with suicidal ideation, plans, or attempts were also assessed. Associations were evaluated by using logistic regression. Results: During the course of 12 months, 3.6% of adolescents reported suicidal ideation without a plan or attempt,.6% reported a suicide plan without an attempt, and 1.9% made a suicide attempt. Overall, two-thirds of adolescents with suicidal ideation (67.3%) and half of those with a plan (54.4%) or attempt (56.9%) did not have any contact with a mental health specialist in the past year. Different predictors of use of care were identified for each group. Conclusions: Adolescent suicidality often is untreated in the United States. Increased outreach efforts to improve treatment access for youths with suicidal ideation and attempts are needed. (Psychiatric Services 63: 989-996, 2012; doi: 10.1176/appi.ps.201200058)

AB Objective: The author reviewed studies of treatments for parasuicide in order to assist health services planners, administrators, and clinicians develop and improve interventions for parasuicide and decrease its prevalence. Methods: Parasuicide, which is a major risk factor for completed suicide, was defined as any nonfatal self-injury, including suicide attempts and self-mutilation. The literature from 1970 to 2001 was searched using MEDLINE and PsycINFO. Only experimental and quasi-experimental controlled trials 4 treatment for parasuicidal individuals were selected for review. Results and conclusion: Epidemiological research shows that parasuicide is a prevalent problem afflicting 4 to 5 percent of individuals in the United States. Parasuicide is a significant predictor of completed suicide, which is the ninth leading cause of death in the United States and accounts for 50 percent more deaths than homicide. Although research on treatments for parasuicide is limited, several treatments have received empirical support. Studies of usual care indicate that empirically, supported treatments are rarely used and that standard treatments, particularly, hospitalization, are very expensive. The author suggests eight practical steps, based on the literature and established health services strategies, for improving services to parasuicidal individuals. These steps are establishing case registries, evaluating the quality, of care for parasuicidal persons, evaluating training in empirically supported treatments for parasuicide, ensuring fidelity to treatment models, evaluating treatment outcomes, identifying local programs for evaluation, providing infrastructural supports to treating clinicians, and implementing quality improvement projects.

   IMPULSIVITY
AB A now robust series of prospective studies have found body mass index to be inversely associated with risk of completed suicide, dating back approximately 4 decades. In the progression from disturbed mental health to suicidal ideation to attempted suicide and completed suicide, augmented by impulsivity and access to highly lethal means, there are several potential steps at which body mass index has been hypothesized to lower risk. These include improved mood and self-image and reduced impulsivity, but relatively little empirical support for these exists in populations. More evidence exists to suggest that greater body weight reduces the case fatality of poisonings and shifts suicidal acts away from selected highly lethal means, such as hanging. However, in the absence of longitudinal studies with repeated measures of weight, mental health, and suicidal ideation, it remains difficult to exclude the possibility of residual confounding, particularly by psychiatric disorders that could lead to both weight loss and suicidal ideation.

AB Background: The present study attempted to assess the relationship between suicide mortality and employment status in Europe.
   Methods: Suicide trends were obtained from the World Health Organization, employment rates from the Conference Board Total Economy Database, and questions about citizens' attitudes towards employment from the European Social Survey. Correlations were analysed. Differences between mean scores for attitudes in Western and Eastern Europe were calculated.
   Results: Employment and suicide trends are negatively correlated in most countries. Suicide mortality is associated with unemployment risk and expectations of inadequate financial resources during unemployment, and negatively correlated with an assured high standard of living for the unemployed. Suicide mortality and the degree of conviction that the government should ensure jobs for all are weakly correlated. Attitudes towards employment and unemployment in Eastern and Western Europe diverge.
   Conclusions: Changes in employment rates influence suicide mortality in many European countries. Factors that increase suicide mortality include lack of confidence in employment status and unemployed people's expectations of insufficient income and low living standards. Suicidal behaviour is more strongly related to attitudes linked with employment status among males than females. In Eastern Europe the status of being unemployed is feared more, and people rely more on the government.

AB Firearms account for approximately half of all suicides in the United States and are highly lethal, widely available, and popular; thus, are an ideal candidate for targeted means safety interventions. However, despite their value as a suicide prevention tool, firearm means safety strategies are not widely utilized, possibly due to factors which impede openness to their use. This study examines the relationship between region, political beliefs, and openness to firearm means safety in a sample of 300 American firearm owners. Overall, firearm owners were more willing to engage in means safety for others than for themselves and to store firearms safely than temporarily remove them from the home. Social policy views and region were significantly associated with openness to firearm means safety measures, however, economic policy views were not. This study provides further context for the development and implementation of efficacious means safety measures capable of overcoming potential barriers to their use.

AB Some studies suggest seasonality of suicide attempts in females, but not in males. The reasons for this gender difference remain unclear. Only few studies addressed the question whether gender differences in seasonality of suicide attempts reflect gender differences in the choice of method for suicide attempts, with inconsistent results. So, this study aimed to analyze the association of gender with seasonality in suicide attempts by persons living in two Northern Bavarian regions [city of Nuremberg (480,000 inhabitants) and region of Wuerzburg (270,000 inhabitants)] between 2000 and 2004. We addressed this question by focussing on the frequency of suicide attempts in relation to the seasons. The sample consisted of 2,269 suicide attempters (882 males and 1,387 females). The overall seasonality was assessed using the chi(2) test for multinomials. Moreover, the ratio of observed to expected number of suicide attempts (OER) with 95% confidence intervals within each season was calculated. As a result, overall distribution of suicide attempts differed significantly between seasons for women (chi(2) = 9.19, df = 3, P = 0.03), but not for men. Female suicide attempts showed a trough in the spring (decline compared to the expected value by 10%; OER = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.8-1.0). This trough was restricted to female low-risk suicide attempts (decline by 13%; OER = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.77-0.98). No seasonality was found for men. Seasonality of high-risk methods was more pronounced than that of low-risk methods; however, no significant gender differences were found concerning this aspect. The overall distribution of the sub-types of suicidal acts (parasuicidal gestures, suicidal pauses, suicide attempts in the strict sense) showed seasonality neither for males nor for females. Whereas seasonality was absent in male suicide attempters, the frequency of low-risk suicide attempts in females was 13.1% lower than expected in the spring.

SO OMEGA-JOURNAL OF DEATH AND DYING
LA English
DT Article
AB Although age-specific female suicide rates have been available for over a century, sociologists have focused on comparing the levels of the rates across age groups, and in studying change overtime. Girard's (1993) article is the first systematic effort to compare the age structure of female suicide rates among national populations. From his study of 1976-1980 suicide rates in 49 less developed and more developed populations, Girard concluded that the age structure of female suicide rates was a function of the level of economic development. Our partial test of this theory found that the age structure of female suicide in mid-19th-century European populations was not at all like the structures of less developed countries in 1976-80. We also replaced Girard's qualitative typology with the index of dissimilarity, allowing quantitative assessment of differences between the age structure of suicide in the United States and the other 19 countries in this study. Age structures in 14 countries were significantly different from the U.S. structure. Tests for significant changes in age structures from 1955-64 to 1985-94 found 17 of the 20 populations had significant change in this period, with younger persons tending to increase their share, while persons 45 to 74 were losing their share.

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and use of services among individuals who do not disclose suicidal intent following a self-inflicted GSW.
   Methods: Electronic medical record data from 128 survivors of self-inflicted GSWs at a level 1 trauma center were analyzed to identify factors associated with nondisclosure of a suicide attempt to medical staff.
   Results: Results indicated that 29% of patients denied that a self-inflicted GSW was a suicide attempt, and 43% of patients who denied suicidal intent were identified by the psychiatric consultation and liaison service as presenting under circumstances suspicious of a suicide attempt. Logistic regression analyses indicated that patients who denied having attempted suicidewere 10.86 timesmore likely to be discharged to home than patients who disclosed suicidal intent. In a multiple regression model, no clinical or demographic characteristics were significantly associated with nondisclosure of suicide intent.
   Conclusions: Patients' nondisclosure of suicidal intent following a self-inflicted GSW may present a barrier to care for patients whose injuries are the result of a suicide attempt. Implications for reducing barriers to care for a high-risk population are discussed, including the impact of nondisclosure on future treatment and the potential utility of brief interventions for suicide risk reduction.

AB The characteristics of health care utilization during the last year of life by Taiwanese who died by suicide were analyzed. The degree of health services utilization was evaluated by extracting the data of National Health Insurance (NHI) outpatient cohort records in 2006. A total of 4,406 fatal suicide cases were matched with the 17,587,901 subjects in the NHI beneficiary registry file. Rate of visit of the suicide decedents for all NHI outpatient services during their last year before death was 85%, and that for mental disorders service only was 30.2%. Average number of visits per person-year of the suicide decedents was 24.5 visits per year, two times higher than that of the survivors. The average numbers of visits (ANV) of male suicide decedents who used the mental disorders services was increased 6.8 times compared to that for all survivors. The increase in female decedents, in contrast, was 2.7 times. The increase in ANV for 1524 age group was 14.6 times, significantly higher than that for the other age groups (<4 times). Effective prediction or prevention of potential suicides through increased awareness and surveillance of medical care resource utilization is possible, especially for male and young adult patients under mental disorder health care.

AB Background Recently, United States life expectancy has stagnated or declined for the poor and working class and risen for the middle and upper classes. Declining labor-union density-the percent of workers who are unionized-has precipitated burgeoning income inequity. We examined whether it has also exacerbated racial and educational mortality inequities. Methods From CDC, we obtained state-level all-cause and overdose/suicide mortality overall and by gender, gender-race, and gender-education from 1986-2016. State-level union density and demographic and economic confounders came from the Current Population Survey. State-level policy confounders included the minimum wage, the generosity of Aid to Families with Dependent Children or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and the generosity of unemployment insurance. To model the exposure-outcome relationship, we used marginal structural modeling. Using state-level inverse probability of treatment-weighted Poisson models, we estimated 3-year moving average union density's effects on the following year's mortality rates. Then, we tested for gender, gender-race, and gender-education effect-modification. Finally, we estimated how racial and educational all-cause mortality inequities would change if union density increased to 1985 or 1988 levels, respectively. Results Overall, a 10% increase in union density was associated with a 17% relative decrease in overdose/suicide mortality (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.70, 0.98), or 5.7 lives saved per 100 000 person-years (95% CI: -10.7, -0.7). Union density's absolute (lives-saved) effects on overdose/suicide mortality were stronger for men than women, but its relative effects were similar across genders. Union density had little effect on all-cause mortality overall or across subgroups, and modeling suggested union-density increases would not affect mortality inequities. Conclusions Declining union density (as operationalized in this study) may not explain all-cause mortality inequities, although increases in union density may reduce overdose/suicide mortality.

AB The issue of physician-assisted suicide is a highly contentious social issue and thus there is importance in understanding the factors that predict attitudes in this domain. In the current study we sought to examine individual differences in moral sentiment towards physician-assisted suicide with a particular focus on religion/religiosity, political ideology, authoritarianism, and Big Five personality traits, all of which were identified in an extensive review of previous studies as potentially relevant predictors. Based on N = 1598 respondents from the Baylor Religion Survey (US) our results indicated an independent role for each of the predictors: being a Protestant or a Catholic (vs. no religion), higher levels of religiosity, higher levels of conservativism (vs. liberalism), and higher levels of authoritarianism uniquely predicted lower levels of support for physician-assisted suicide. Moreover, higher levels of extraversion independently predicted greater support for physician-assisted suicide. These results confirm a set of previously described predictors in an independent data set and extend prior research by showing that they independently predict moral sentiment towards physician-assisted suicide when modelled jointly. In summary, moral sentiment towards physician-assisted suicide reflects individual differences in a broad range of social and psychological factors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined suicide ideation, attempts, and subsequent mental health service among a sample of 948 youth from substance abuse treatment facilities across the United States. Youth were surveyed at intake and every 3 months for a 1-year period. Thirty percent of youth reported ideating in at least one interview, and 12% reported attempting suicide; almost half of all youth reported receiving outpatient mental health treatment at least once, and close to one-third of all youth reported being on prescription drugs for an emotional or behavioral problem. Higher levels of conduct disorder symptoms were associated with both ideation and attempts, while higher levels of depressive symptoms and being female were associated with ideation only. Among all youth, older youth were less likely to receive outpatient and prescription drug treatment, and Black and Hispanic youth were less likely to receive prescription drug treatment than White youth. Among youth who reported ideating, those with conduct disorder were less likely to receive prescription drug treatment 3 months later. These findings emphasize a high prevalence of suicide risk behavior in substance abuse treatment programs and provide insight into the specialized treatment youth in substance abuse treatment at risk for suicide currently receive.

AB Adolescent suicide rates exhibit stark geographic disparities, with rates highest in rural areas. The causes of this disparity remain unclear. We investigated whether adolescent nonfatal suicidal ideation and attempt-leading risk factors for suicide-demonstrate the same rural/urban disparity. Using adolescent data from the 2011-2014 waves of the population-representative California Health Interview Survey (CHIS; N = 4,616), we estimated associations between residence in a rural area and suicidal ideation and suicide attempt, as well as access to psychological care. Survey-weighted logistic regression models controlled for individual- and family-level covariates. Results showed that rural adolescents were, compared to urban adolescents, substantially less likely to report recent suicidal ideation (OR = 0.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.10, 0.61) and suicide attempt (OR = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.05, 0.66). Suicidal youths in rural and urban areas were equally likely, however, to report receiving psychological care. In this study, rural adolescents in California reported lower rates of nonfatal suicidal behavior compared to urban peers. This pattern contrasts with rates of adolescent suicide fatality, which are higher in rural areas. Results suggest that reducing geographic disparities in youth suicide may require multifaceted public health approaches, in addition to better identification and treatment for high-risk adolescents.

AB Background Laws allowing assisted suicide and euthanasia have been implemented in many locations around the world but some individuals suffering with terminal illness receiving palliative care services are hastening death or die by suicide without assistance. This systematic review aims to summarise evidence of palliative care professionals' experiences of patients who died by suicide or hastened death in areas where assisted dying is legal and to understand when hastened death is considered to be a suicide. Methods AMED, CINAHL Complete, PsycINFO, PubMED, and Academic Search Ultimate were searched for articles from inception through June 2018. Quality assessment used the Hawker framework. Results A total of 1518 titles were screened resulting in thirty studies meeting eligibility criteria for this review. Published studies about professionals' experiences from areas with legalised assisted dying includes limited information about patients who hasten death outside legal guidelines, die by suicide without assistance, or if the law impacts suicide among palliative care patients. Conclusion There are a range of experiences and emotions professionals' experience with patients who die by euthanasia, assisted suicide, or hasten death without assistance. The included literature suggests improved communication among professionals is needed but does not explicitly identify when a hastened death is deemed a suicide in areas where assisted dying is practiced. More research is needed to help clarify what hastened death means in a palliative care context and identify how and if assisted dying impacts issues of suicide in palliative care settings.

AB Background: Several studies have suggested strong associations between economic downturns and suicide mortality, but are at risk of bias due to unmeasured confounding. The rationale for our study was to provide more robust evidence by using a quasi-experimental design.
   Methods: We analysed 955 561 suicides occurring in the USA from 1980 to 2010 and used a broad index of economic activity in each US state to measure economic conditions. We used a quasi-experimental, fixed-effects design and we also assessed whether the effects were heterogeneous by demographic group and during periods of official recession.
   Results: After accounting for secular trends, seasonality and unmeasured fixed characteristics of states, we found that an economic downturn similar in magnitude to the 2007 Great Recession increased suicide mortality by 0.14 deaths per 100 000 population [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00, 0.28] or around 350 deaths. Effects were stronger for men (0.28, 95% CI 0.07, 0.49) than women and for those with less than 12 years of education (1.22 95% CI 0.83, 1.60) compared with more than 12 years of education. The overall effect did not differ for recessionary (0.11, 95% CI -0.02, 0.25) vs non-recessionary periods (0.15, 95% CI 0.01, 0.29). The main study limitation is the potential for misclassified death certificates and we cannot definitively rule out unmeasured confounding.
   Conclusions: We found limited evidence of a strong, population-wide detrimental effect of economic downturns on suicide mortality. The overall effect hides considerable heterogeneity by gender, socioeconomic position and time period.

AB Suicide has remained a leading cause of death among African American males, yet empirical investigations that focus on the experiences of this group are limited. Therefore, we aim to interrogate the impact of everyday discrimination as a risk factor for depressive symptoms and suicide ideation among African American men. Data were drawn from the African American male subsample of the National Survey of American Life (n?=?1,271). Path analysis and tests for indirect effects were used to examine relationships between everyday discrimination, depressive symptoms, and suicide ideation. Three sources of everyday discrimination were examined (any everyday discrimination, race-based everyday discrimination, and other everyday discrimination). Study findings revealed that race-based everyday discrimination was the only type of discrimination that was significantly associated with both increased rates of depressive symptoms and suicide ideation. Further, the indirect effect from race-based everyday discrimination to suicide ideation via depressive symptoms was also statistically significant. Thus, the impact of daily encounters with discrimination extends beyond depressive symptoms and is related to higher rates of suicide ideation. Moreover, experiences with discrimination do not have to be overt to be harmful toward African American men?s mental health. Culturally relevant suicide prevention interventions are needed to account for the role of discrimination in the lives of African American men.

AB Youth who experience difficulty in school are at risk for suicide, yet there is little published information specific to risk and protective factors among this group. The purpose of this study was to conduct an in-depth examination of risk and protective factors associated with suicidal behaviour among youth who were experiencing problems in school and to compare these factors between suicide risk and non-suicide risk subgroups. Participants were 730 high school students in the Northwest and Southwest regions of the United States, aged 14-21 years. All participants were known to be experiencing difficulty with grades and/or attendance. Students completed a paper-and-pencil questionnaire and a one-on-one interview, which assessed suicidal behaviours as well as risk factors (e.g. drug involvement, emotional distress, stress), and protective factors (e.g. self-esteem, coping, support). Analysis of covariance tests, controlling for age and sex, were conducted to examine differences between the suicide risk and non-suicide risk groups on each risk and protective factor. The suicide risk subgroup reported higher levels of all risk factors, except alcohol and marijuana use, and lower levels of protective factors. While the groups did not differ on frequency of alcohol or marijuana use, they did differ on other illicit drug use and consequences of alcohol and other illicit drug use. Recommendations for nurses practising in school settings are discussed.

AB Suicide rates in the United States have been increasing in recent years, and the period after an inpatient psychiatric hospitalization is one of especially high risk for death by suicide. Peer support specialists may play an important role in addressing recommendations that suicide prevention activities focus on protective factors by improving hope and connectedness. The present study developed a peer specialist intervention titled Peers for Valued Living (PREVAIL) to reduce suicide risk, incorporating components of motivational interviewing and psychotherapies targeting suicide risk into recovery-based peer support. A randomized controlled pilot study was conducted to assess the acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity of the intervention. A total of 70 adult psychiatric inpatients at high risk for suicide were enrolled into the study. Participants were randomized to usual care (n = 36) or to the 12-week PREVAIL peer support intervention (n = 34). Those in the PREVAIL arm completed an average of 6.1 (SD = 5.0) peer sessions over the course of 12 weeks. Fidelity was rated for 20 peer support sessions, and 85% of the peer specialist sessions demonstrated adequate fidelity to administering a conversation tool regarding hope, belongingness, or safety, and 72.5% of general support skills (e.g., validation) were performed with adequate fidelity. Participants' qualitative responses (n = 23) were highly positive regarding peer specialists' ability to relate, listen, and advise and to provide support specifically during discussions about suicide. Findings demonstrate that a peer support specialist suicide prevention intervention is feasible and acceptable for patients at high risk for suicide.

AB Background: Suicide is a public health concern for United States veterans and civilians. Prior research has shown neurobiological factors in suicide. However, studies of neuroimaging correlates of suicide risk have been limited. This study applied complex weighted network analyses to characterize the neural connectivity in white matter in veterans with suicide behavior.
   Methods: Twenty-eight veterans without suicide behavior (NS), 29 with a history of suicidal ideation only (SI), and 23 with prior suicide attempt (SA) completed diffusion tensor brain imaging, the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS). Structural connectivity networks among 82 parcellated brain regions were produced using whole-brain tractography. Global and nodal metrics of network topology have been calculated.
   Results: SA had shorter characteristic path length and greater global efficiency and mean weighted degree of global network metrics (p < 0.024). SA had more hub nodes than NS and SI. The left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) showed significantly greater weighted degree in SA relative to others (p < 0.0003). Nonplanning subscale of BIS correlated with the weighted degrees of the left PCC within SA. In rich club connectivity, SA had higher local connections than others (p = 0.001).
   Conclusion: Veterans with prior suicide attempt had altered connectivity networks characteristics in the white matter. These findings may be distinctive neurobiological markers for individuals with suicide attempt. Strong connectivity in the left PCC may be implicated in impulsivity in veterans with suicide attempt.

AB Objective Suicide mortality rates in rural areas of the United States are twice that of rates in urban areas, and identifying which factors-eg, higher rates of suicidal distress, lower rates of help-seeking behaviors, or greater access to firearms-contribute to this rural/urban disparity could help target interventions.
   Method Using 2015-2016 data on adult respondents to the California Health Interview Survey (n = 40,041), we examined associations between residence in a rural (vs nonrural) census tract and nonfatal suicidal ideation and attempt.
   Results We found that living in a rural area was not associated with nonfatal suicidal behavior (OR for past-year suicidal ideation = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.63-1.20; OR for past-year suicide attempt = 0.55, CI: 0.20-1.48). Women living in rural areas had higher odds of lifetime suicidal ideation compared to women living in nonrural areas, but this difference was not significant (OR = 1.17, CI: 0.94-1.44). We also found that, among individuals reporting suicidal behavior, there were few rural/nonrural differences in perceived need for treatment, such as seeing a physician or taking a prescription for mental health problems.
   Conclusions Our results do not suggest higher suicidal distress or lower treatment-seeking behaviors as explanations for the rural/urban disparity in suicide mortality rates. Further attention is needed to the unique risk factors driving suicidality in rural areas, as well as exploring heterogeneity in these factors across different rural contexts.

AB Using Veterans Health Administration data, we assessed the extent to which mean past-year (365 days) pain intensity scores were associated with suicide attempts in the year after the initiation of pain specialty services in fiscal years 2012 to 2014 (N = 221,817). Suicide attempts in the year after initiating Veterans Health Administration pain specialty services (ie, index visit) were identified using medical records and a suicide surveillance sources. Adjusted hazard models accounted for key covariates (eg, demographics, comorbidities). Subgroup analyses were also conducted on veterans without and with a suicide attempt in the year before the index visit to examine risk for first attempt and reattempts. Adjusted analyses revealed that pain intensity scores were significantly associated suicide attempts after the index visit. Specifically, veterans with severe and moderate pain had a hazards ratio of 1.41 (95% confidence interval = 1.21-1.63) and 1.29 (95% confidence interval = 1.13-1.47), respectively. These results were consistent for those without a past-year attempt and for those with a past-year attempt. The results suggest that moderate to severe pain intensity in the year before initiating pain specialty services may be a useful indicator of suicide risk, even when considered in the context of key factors.
   Perspective: This study used national administrative and suicide surveillance data to assess the relationship between pain intensity and suicide attempts after an initial visit for pain specialty services among veterans. These findings highlight the potential usefulness of assessing pain intensity as an indicator for suicide risk. (C) Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of the American Pain Society

AB Introduction: Studies have pointed to rurality as an important factor influencing suicide. Research so far suggests that several sociodemograpic and psychiatric factors might influence urban-rural differences in suicide. Also, their contribution appears to depend on sex and age. Unfortunately, studies including a comprehensive set of explanatory variables altogether are still scare and most studies have failed to present their analyses split by sex and age groups. Also, urban-rural differences in suicide in Spain have been rarely investigated. The present study aimed at explaining rural-urban differences in suicidality in the province of Castellon (Spain). A comprehensive set of sociodemographic and psychiatric factors was investigated and analyses were split by sex and age.
   Material and method: The sample comprised all suicides recorded in the province of Castellon from January 2009 to December 2015 (n = 343). Sociodemographic data included sex, age, and suicide method. Psychiatric data included the history of mental health service utilization, psychiatric diagnosis, suicide attempts, and psychiatric hospitalization.
   Results: Consistent with past research, suicide rates were highest in rural areas, especially in men and older people. We also found that urban-rural differences in sociodemographic and psychiatric variables were sensitive to sex and age. Our results indicated that specialized mental health service use and accessibility to suicide means might help understand urban-rural differences in suicide, especially in men. When exploring urban-rural differences as a function of age, general practitioner visits for psychiatric reasons were more frequent in the older age group in rural areas.
   Conclusions: Study implications for suicide prevention strategies in Spain are discussed. (C) 2017 SEP y SEPB. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

TI Firearm Suicide Among Veterans in the General Population: Findings From

DT Article

ID NVDRS SUPPLEMENT; UNITED-STATES; MENTAL-HEALTH; OLDER WOMEN;
   SURVEILLANCE; LETHALITY; RISK; US
AB Background: Military veterans are particularly Vulnerable to suicide compared with their civilian peers. Scant attention has been devoted to the problem of firearm suicide among veterans, particularly women. The purpose of this study was to examine the rate, prevalence, and relative odds of firearm use among veteran suicide decedents in the general population.
   Methods: The analyses are based on data derived from 28,534 suicide decedents from the 2003 to 2006 National Violent Death Reporting System. Results: Across the age groups, male and female veterans had higher firearm suicide rates than nonveterans. Among males and females, younger veterans (18-34 years) had the highest firearm and total suicide rates. The male and female veteran suicide decedents were, respectively, 1.3 and 1.6 times more likely to use firearms relative to nonveterans after adjusting for age, marital status, race, and region of residence.
   Conclusions: Although violent death and the use of firearms are generally associated with men, the results reported here suggest that firearms among female veterans deserve particular attention among health professionals within and outside the veterans affairs system. In addition, the focus should not be exclusively on the Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom military cohort but also on men and women who served in earlier combat theaters, including the Gulf war, Vietnam Era, Korean Conflict, and World War II.

AB Background: Indigenous young people have significantly higher suicide rates than their non-indigenous counterparts. There is a need for culturally appropriate and effective suicide prevention programs for this demographic. Aims: This review assesses suicide prevention programs that have been evaluated for indigenous youth in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. Method: The databases MEDLENE and PsycINFO were searched for publications on suicide prevention programs targeting indigenous youth that include reports on evaluations and outcomes. Program content, indigenous involvement, evaluation design, program implementation, and outcomes were assessed for each article. Results: The search yielded 229 articles; 90 abstracts were assessed, and 11 articles describing nine programs were reviewed. Two Australian programs and seven American programs were included. Programs were culturally tailored, flexible, and incorporated multiple-levels of prevention. No randomized controlled trials were found, and many programs employed ad hoc evaluations, poor program description, and no process evaluation. Conclusion: Despite culturally appropriate content, the results of the review indicate that more controlled study designs using planned evaluations and valid outcome measures are needed in research on indigenous youth suicide prevention. Such changes may positively influence the future of research on indigenous youth suicide prevention as the outcomes and efficacy will be more reliable.

AB The goal of this study was to test a path model for the relationships between age, gender, traditional bullying and cyberbullying victimization, and violent behavior, substance abuse, depression, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in adolescents. A hypothesized path model was fit to data from the 2011 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) on a nationally representative sample of 15,425 high-school students from across the United States. Results suggested that the effects of traditional and cyberbullying victimization on suicidal thinking, suicide planning, and suicide attempts were mediated by violent behavior, substance abuse, and depression. Results also suggested reciprocal paths between substance abuse and violent behavior. There were statistically significant indirect paths from both traditional and cyberbullying victimization to suicide attempts without the involvement of depression, suicidal thinking, or suicide planning, findings suggesting a model for spontaneous, unplanned adolescent suicides. Results suggested that female adolescents who reported cyberbullying victimization also reported higher rates of depression and suicidal behaviors compared to their male counterparts, and that as adolescents got older, depression and substance abuse tended to increase, while violent behavior and suicidal thinking tended to decrease. The implications of these findings for social workers, school counselors, and others who work with adolescents are considered. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In Tobin v. SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals a jury in the U.S. District Court for the District of Wyoming found that the medication Paxil "can cause some individuals to commit homicide and/or suicide," and that it was a legal cause of the deaths in this case. A motion was recently put before the United States District Court for the District of Utah to adopt the findings of the Tobin case-via the application of collateral estoppel-to a case involving an individual's suicide while prescribed Paxil. This article summarizes these two cases, as reflected in court documents, and comments on limitations of common causality assertions.

AB Recent research suggests that firefighters experience elevated rates of suicidal ideation and behaviors. The interpersonal theory of suicide may shed light on this finding. This theory postulates that suicidal desire is strongest among individuals experiencing perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness, and that the combination of suicide desire and acquired capability for suicide is necessary for the development of suicidal behaviors. We tested the propositions of the interpersonal theory in a large sample of current United States firefighters (N=863). Participants completed self-report measures of perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, fearlessness about death (FAD; a component of acquired capability), and career suicidal ideation and suicide attempt history. Regression models were used to examine the association between interpersonal theory constructs, career suicidal ideation severity, and the presence of career suicide attempts. In line with theory predictions, the three-way interaction between perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, and FAD was significantly associated with career suicide attempts, beyond participant sex. However, findings were no longer significant after accounting for years of firefighter service or age. Contrary to predictions, the two-way interaction between perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness was not significantly related to career suicidal ideation severity. Applications of the theory to firefighters and future research are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Fatal; Poisoning; Inhalation
ID HELIUM; TRENDS; US
AB Background. In 2010, 6,599 poisoning suicides were reported in the United States (US). While medications remain the primary substances involved in completed poisoning suicides, successful fatal poisonings with non-pharmaceutical substances occur with some regularity. The goal of this study was to identify successful suicides caused by non-pharmaceutical self-poisoning in a large US county over the last 12 years. Methods. A large US-county medical-examiner's database was queried for all suicides in which exposure to non-pharmaceuticals was listed as the cause of death from 2000 to 2012. Substances were categorized by specific toxin when available and by product type when unavailable. Decedent age, sex, and circumstances surrounding each case were also reviewed. Results. Ages ranged from 18 to 95 (median 48) years. There were 159 (77%) males and 48 females. A total of 11 poisons were utilized. Discussion. Worldwide, intentional CO inhalation is a common method for committing suicide and intentional CO inhalation was the most common method of non-pharmaceutical self-poisoning suicide in our data. Other relatively common poisons including ethylene glycol and cyanide were employed in a relatively constant manner over time as well. Surprisingly, there have been an increasing number of helium-inhalation deaths in recent years. Conclusion. Inhaled toxins are the most popular (81%) in non-pharmaceutical suicides, likely due to their rapidity of death. Although much less frequently, individuals successfully employ a broad spectrum of other toxins to commit suicide.

AB Suicide is a major public health concern, with over 100 individuals dying by suicide per day in the United States alone. Therefore, suicide risk assessment is an essential aspect of mental health care. The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2-Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF; Ben-Porath & Tellegen, 2008-2011; Tellegen & Ben-Porath, 2008) has a Suicidal/Death Ideation (SUI) scale consisting of 5 items that describe recent suicidal ideation or behaviors. Although this scale has clear face validity, few studies have examined the clinical utility of this scale. The purpose of the current study was to examine associations between the SUI scale and other established measures of suicidal ideation and behavior, including the Depressive Symptom Inventory Suicidality Subscale (DSI-SS; Metalsky & Joiner, 1997), Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS; Beck & Steer, 1991; Beck, Steer, & Ranieri, 1988), self-report of lifetime suicide attempts, and clinician ratings of suicide risk. Participants were 998 therapy- and assessment-seeking outpatients. Analyses indicated that the SUI scale was positively associated with other self-reported measures of suicidal ideation and behavior. Significant differences in SUI scale scores also emerged among the clinician rating categories of suicide risk. The SUI scale was able to predict previous suicide attempts over and above age, gender, and other MMPI-2-RF scales related to depression. Finally, relative risk ratios for suicide attempts indicate increased risk of suicidality, with higher T scores on the SUI scale. Overall, findings suggest that the MMPI-2-RF SUI scale may be a useful tool for identifying individuals at risk for suicidal ideation and behavior in clinical settings.

AB Objective: We sought to determine whether state firearm legislation correlated with firearm-related fatality rates (FFR) during a 15-year period.
   Background: The politicized and controversial topic of firearm legislation has been grossly understudied when the relative impact of American firearm violence is considered. Scientific evidence regarding gun legislation effectiveness remains scant.
   Methods: Demographic and intent data (1999-2013) were collected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Web-Based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System database and compared by state firearm legislation rankings with respect to FFR. State scorecards were obtained from firearm-restrictive (Brady Campaign/Law Center against Gun Violence [BC/LC]) and less-restrictive (National Rifle Association) groups. FFR were compared between restrictive and least-restrictive states during 3 periods (1999-2003, 2004-2008, 2009-2013).
   Results: During 1999 to 2013, 462,043 Americans were killed by firearms. Overall FFR did not change during the 3 periods (10.89 +/- 3.99/100,000; 10.71 +/- 3.93/100,000; 11.14 +/- 3.91/100,000; P=0.87). Within each period, least-restrictive states had greater unintentional, pediatric, and adult suicide, White and overall FFR than restrictive states (all P<0.05). Conversely, no correlation was seen, during any of the 3 time periods, with either homicide or Black FFR-population subsets accounting for 41.7% of firearm deaths.
   Conclusions: Restrictive firearm legislation is associated with decreased pediatric, unintentional, suicide, and overall FFR, but homicide and Black FFR appear unaffected. Future funding and research should be directed at both identifying the most effective aspects of firearm legislation and creating legislation that equally protects every segment of the American population.

AB Pilot aircraft-assisted suicides (AAS) are rare, and there is limited understanding of copycat phenomenon among aviators. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible effect the 11 September 2001, terrorist attacks had on pilot AASs in the U.S. Fatal aviation accidents in the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) database were searched using the following search words: "suicide", "murder-suicide" and "homicide-suicide". The timeline between 11 September 1996, and 11 September 2004, was analyzed. Only those accidents in which NTSB judged that the cause of the accident was suicide were included in the final analysis. The relative risk (RR) of the pilot AASs in all fatal accidents in the U.S. was calculated in order to compare the one, two, and three-year periods after the September 11 terrorist attacks with five years preceding the event. The RR of a fatal general aviation aircraft accident being due to pilot suicide was 3.68-fold (95% confidence interval 1.04-12.98) during the first year after 11 September 2001, but there was not a statistically significant increase in the later years. This study showed an association, albeit not determinate causal effect, of a very specific series of simultaneous terrorist murder-suicides with subsequent pilot AASs.

AB Despite the magnitude and consistency of risk estimates in the peer-reviewed literature linking firearm availability and suicide, inferring causality has been questioned on the theoretical basis that existing studies may have failed to account for the possibility that members of households with firearms differ from members of households without firearms in important ways related to suicide risk. The current bias analysis directly addresses this concern by describing the salient characteristics that such an unmeasured confounder would need to possess in order to yield the associations between firearm availability and suicide observed in the literature when, in fact, the causal effect is null. Four US studies, published between 1992 and 2003, met our eligibility criteria. We find that any such unmeasured confounder would need to possess an untenable combination of characteristics, such as being not only 1) as potent a suicide risk factor as the psychiatric disorders most tightly linked to suicide (e.g., major depressive and substance use disorders) but also 2) an order of magnitude more imbalanced across households with versus without firearms than is any known risk factor. No such confounder has been found or even suggested. The current study strongly suggests that unmeasured confounding alone is unlikely to explain the association between firearms and suicide.

AB This report uses an enhanced conceptualisation of self-injury mortality (SIM), which comprised registered or known suicides by any method and estimated non-suicide deaths from opioid and other drug self-intoxication. SIM surpassed diabetes as a cause of death in the USA in 2015. The gap expanded in 2016 with respective rates of 29.1 and 24.8 per 100 000 population. Facing similar social and psychologically complex health problems to SIM, the USA has initiated and sustained successful broad-based prevention efforts that have reduced deaths from cardiovascular diseases, smoking-related lung cancer, HIV and motor vehicular injury-given both necessary epidemiological understanding to define the problem and sufficient political will to address it. Development of strategies to prevent SIM will be facilitated by focusing on factors that are common risks for diverse outcomes. Like premature mortality frequently associated with diabetes, deaths from self-injurious behaviours are preventable.

AB Veterinary surgeons are known to be at a higher risk of suicide compared with the general population. There has been much speculation regarding possible mechanisms underlying the increased suicide risk in the profession, but little empirical research. A computerised search of published literature on the suicide risk and influences on suicide among veterinarians, with comparison to the risk and influences in other occupational groups and in the general population, was used to develop a structured review. Veterinary surgeons have a proportional mortality ratio (PMR) for suicide approximately four times that of the general population and around twice that of other healthcare professions. A complex interaction of possible mechanisms may occur across the course of a veterinary career to increase the risk of suicide. Possible factors include the characteristics of individuals entering the profession, negative effects during undergraduate training, work-related stressors, ready access to and knowledge of means, stigma associated with mental illness, professional and social isolation, and alcohol or drug misuse (mainly prescription drugs to which the profession has ready access). Contextual effects such as attitudes to death and euthanasia, formed through the profession's routine involvement with euthanasia of companion animals and slaughter of farm animals, and suicide 'contagion' due to direct or indirect exposure to suicide of peers within this small profession are other possible influences.

AB Objective, Design, Materials, and Methods: In recent years, many researchers throughout the world have examined every aspect of anxiety disorders. Panic disorder is one of the most common anxiety disorders. We examined the presence of panic disorder in the incidence and circumstances regarding all suicidal cases during the 7-year-period, 1996-2002, that were reported to Mic Prefectural Police Headquarters. In the present study, we reviewed conventional reports related to suicide such as suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and completed suicide in panic disorder patients.
   Results: Among the morbidity rates of panic disorder, the mean rates were 2.13% (SD=0.88) in total, ranging from 0.4% in 1989 to 3.5% in 1994, 1.11% (SD=0.47) in men, and 3.06% (SD=1.25) in women. With regard to the morbidity rates of panic attack, the mean rates were 7.60% (SD=4.24). The morbidity rate for panic attack was approximately 3.5 times greater than that for panic disorder. Regarding the relation between suicide and panic disorder, panic disorder patients without depression and personality disorder tend to have fewer suicide attempts, despite suicidal ideation. These findings are supported by the present data.
   Conclusion: Medical staff must pay close attention to the relationship between suicide attempts and completed suicides of panic disorder patients and other psychiatric disorders.

Given the number of patients in the United States with epilepsy, it is very likely that primary care physicians will continue to provide care for these patients. This article refreshes some of the knowledge around the diagnosis of epilepsy, discusses special populations that may require additional management considerations, highlights the association of epilepsy with multiple comorbidities, and discusses antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment, including issues surrounding adherence and safety of AED therapy.

AB Purpose of review This paper reviews the epidemiology and sequelae of adolescent depression, recent studies of antidepressants and psychotherapeutic modalities for treatment of adolescent depression, and the black box warning from the United States Food and Drug Administration regarding the use of antidepressants in adolescents.
   Recent findings Over the past 4 years, four major randomized placebo-controlled trials of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in adolescents have been published. Although each of these published studies concluded that the drug under study was efficacious, the United States Food and Drug Administration and others have offered words of caution. Over the past 2 years, there has been increasing concern that antidepressants may increase suicidal thinking and behavior (not completed suicide) in depressed adolescents. The United States Food and Drug Administration has issued a black box warning asking providers to use caution when prescribing antidepressants in children under the age of 18.
   Summary Adolescent depression is common, socially and economically costly, and a potentially lethal disease. Recent studies of antidepressant use in adolescents have demonstrated variable efficacy and an increased risk of adverse events, including suicidality. The evidence is greatest to support the efficacy of fluoxetine, and thus it remains the only selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of depression in children and adolescents. Psychotherapy is strongly encouraged in any patient for whom medication is prescribed. The risk of adverse events associated with antidepressant use requires caution when these medications are prescribed to adolescents. In an adolescent with depression, however, there is an inherent and greater risk to doing nothing.

AB Suicide with hostile intent encompasses a wide range of behaviors, from self-killing by methods that can harm others, to the suicide that generally follows a spree-killing raid. Reports on school shooting, a highly dangerous and lethal behavior that is spreading from North America to European countries, are analyzed within the paradigm of suicide with hostile intent, with the purpose of discovering some elements that might prevent and limit the dissemination of this behavior by imitation. In school shooting, the perpetrators often register a message before their killing raid, as in an ancient form of suicidal assault, the devotio, that was widespread across ancient Mediterranean Roman, Greek, and Hebrew cultures. The development of a code of rules to report on these episodes, likely to attract the interest of the population for their bloody implications, could prevent the dissemination of cultural norms that encourage this behavior.

AB This article examines major risk factors for suicide among sexual minority youth using Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory. Although suicidal behavior among sexual minority youth is a major public concern in the United States, understanding of this phenomenon has been limited since the majority of empirical research studies have addressed individual level characteristics without much consideration to the larger environmental contexts. This review integrates past and current empirical findings on suicidal behaviors of sexual minority youth within the context of micro-, meso-, exo-, macro-, and chrono-systems levels. Finally, it draws implications for assessment, prevention, and intervention strategies. (C) 2011 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Immigrants constitute a significant percentage of the total population living in the United States; however, there is a paucity of research unique to suicidality among immigrants. The present article examines the applicability of the three variables of the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicidal behavior-acquired capability for suicide, sense of thwarted belongingness, and perceived burdensomeness-to conceptualize, assess, and treat suicidality among immigrants. Risk and protective factors and mechanisms are discussed in the context of 2 case studies and immigrant paradox. Clinical implications include assessment and treatment of immigrant-specific experiences. Obstacles to treatment and future research directions are presented.

AB Background: Offenders are at elevated risk for interpersonal violence victimization (IVV), which is a risk factor for suicide-related outcomes in some populations, suggesting the importance of examining risk associated with IVV in offenders. Aims: The present study examined the association between IVV and suicidal ideation (SI) among criminal offenders in a pretrial jail diversion program in the United States. Methods: 266 offenders were screened for ten common Axis I psychiatric disorders along with current SI and past-year IVV. Results: Past-year IVV was significantly associated with current SI, and the association remained significant after adjusting for symptoms of ten Axis I psychiatric disorders, respectively and simultaneously. Gender did not moderate the IVV-SI association. Conclusions: The findings support a connection between IVV and SI in criminal offenders.

AB Ethnic groups differ in rates of suicidal behaviors among youths, the context within which suicidal behavior occurs (e.g., different precipitants, vulnerability and protective factors, and reactions to suicidal behaviors), and patterns of help-seeking. In this article, the authors discuss the cultural context of suicidal behavior among African American, American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian American and Pacific Islander, and Latino adolescents, and the implications of these contexts for suicide prevention and treatment. Several cross-cutting issues are discussed, including acculturative stress and protective factors within cultures; the roles of religion and spirituality and the family in culturally sensitive interventions; different manifestations and interpretations of distress in different cultures; and the impact of stigma and cultural distrust on help-seeking. The needs for culturally sensitive and community-based interventions are discussed, along with future opportunities for research in intervention development and evaluation.

AB In this article we present evidence about the factors that determine four gradual decisions on the part of adolescents to attempt suicide. To that end, we estimate a series of binary choice models by using data drawn from the U.S. National Youth Risk Behavior Surveys corresponding to 1991, 1993, 1995, and 1997. Our results show that the decisions to attempt suicide are motivated by both demographic and psychosocial variables, such as gender, age, ethnicity, education failure, possession of a gun, habitual participation in sporting activities, individual weight perception, and taking pills or provoking vomiting to lose weight. Moreover, we also find that a significant degree of influence is exerted by another group of factors, such as the consumption of drugs, sexual relationships, and, finally, pregnancy.

AB Background: To examine temporal variations of age, period, and cohort on suicide mortality rate in Hong Kong (HK) from 1976 to 2010, and speculate the macroenvironmental mechanisms of the observed trends. Methods: Poisson age-period-cohort modeling was used to delineate the effects of age, period, and cohort on suicide mortality. Analysis by sex was also conducted to examine if gender difference exists for suicidal behaviours. Results: Age-cohort model provides the best fit to the mortality data, implying that the cohort effect is likely to explain more of the contributions to HK's suicide mortality pattern than the period effect. Risk of suicide mortality increases nonlinearly with age and accelerates after age 65-69 for both sexes. Moreover, the cohort effects differ between the sexes-risk of mortality increases continually for men born after 1961, but no change is observed for women since the 1941 cohort. Conclusions: With increased risk of suicide mortality in younger cohorts and the age effect of suicide mortality, we may see future increase in suicide mortality as these younger cohorts age. Further studies are needed to clarify plausible associations between broader sociohistorical changes in the population impacting psychological risk factors and suicidal behaviour to better inform suicide prevention strategies.

DT Article
DE Media; suicide; Robin Williams
ID GUIDELINES
AB Objective: This study assessed the extent to which local reporting of Robin Williams' suicide (on 11 August 2014) was associated with suicide in Australia. It followed several studies in the United States which showed that there were significant increases in suicide following media reports of Williams' death and that those media reports were less than optimal in terms of adherence to best-practice guidelines. In a previous study, we demonstrated that Australian media reports of Williams' suicide were largely adherent with our Mindframe guidelines on responsible reporting of suicide, so we speculated that there would be no increase in suicide following the reporting of Williams' suicide in Australia. Method: We extracted data on Australian suicides from the National Coroners Information System for the period 2001 to 2016. We conducted interrupted time series regression analyses to determine whether there were changes in suicides in the 5-month period immediately following Williams' suicide. Results: Our hypothesis that there would be no increase in suicides in Australia following Williams' highly publicised suicide was not supported. There was an 11% increase in suicides in the 5-month period following Williams' death, largely accounted for by men aged 30-64 and by people who died by hanging (the method Williams used). Conclusion: It may be that Australians were exposed to reports that contravened safe reporting recommendations, particularly via overseas media or social media, and/or that some Australian reports may have had unhelpful overarching narratives, despite largely adhering to the Mindframe guidelines. The Mindframe guidelines constitute international best practice but consideration should be given to whether certain recommendations within them should be further reinforced and whether more nuanced information about how stories should be framed could be provided. Future revision and augmentation of the Mindframe guidelines should, as always, involve media professionals.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the epidemiology, phenomenology, and occupation-specific risk factors for suicide among regular-duty military personnel as a model for other professions at risk for workplace suicide.
   Method: Suicide incidence and methods were determined in a retrospective military cohort comprising all deaths ( N= 732) of regular-duty military personnel in the Irish Defence Forces between 1970 and 2002. A retrospective, case-control study using pair-matched military comparison subjects was conducted to determine occupation-specific risk factors for suicide, particularly by firearm, among military personnel. Risk factors were subjected to chi-square analysis or independent t tests and entered into a binary logistic regression analysis model.
   Results: The period-averaged suicide rate for the cohort was 15.3/100,000. Firearm suicides accounted for 53% of the cases. Suicides that took place on duty occurred predominantly when personnel were alone shortly after duty commencement the morning. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses identified psychiatric illness and a past history of deliberate self-harm, morning duty ( shortly after duty assumption and consequent access to firearms), and a recent medical downgrading as independent risk factors predicting firearm suicide among military personnel.
   Conclusions: Occupation influences suicide method. Access to and opportunity to use lethal means in the workplace are distinct but related occupation-specific suicide risk factors in the military and in other at-risk professions. In professions where access to lethal means is inevitable, moderating opportunity for suicide is crucially important. In regular-duty military personnel, a medical downgrading, combined with risk factors established in civilians such as younger age, male gender, psychiatric illness, and past self-harm, increases the risk of suicide. The findings may be used to guide military harm-reduction strategies and have applicability in strategies for other professions at risk for workplace suicide.

AB Introduction: One thousand five hundred suicides take place on inpatient psychiatry units in the United States each year, over 70% by hanging. Understanding the methods and the environmental components of inpatient suicide may help to reduce its incidence.
   Methods: All Root Cause Analysis reports of suicide or suicide attempts in inpatient mental health units in Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals between December 1999 and December 2011 were reviewed. We coded the method of suicide, anchor point and lanyard for cases of hanging, and implement for cutting, and brought together all other reports of inpatient hazards from VA staff for review.
   Results: There were 243 reports of suicide attempts and completions: 43.6% (106) were hanging, 22.6% (55) were cutting, 15.6% (38) were strangulation, and 7.8% (19) were overdoses. Doors accounted for 52.2% of the anchor points used for the 22 deaths by hanging; sheets or bedding accounted for 58.5% of the lanyards. In addition, 23.1% of patients used razor blades for cutting.
   Conclusions: The most common method of suicide attempts and completions on inpatient mental health units is hanging. It is recommended that common lanyards and anchor points be removed from the environment of care. We provide more information about such hazards and introduce a decision tree to help healthcare providers to determine which hazards to remove. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Suicide is a leading cause of death among youth worldwide. The purpose of the current review was to examine recent cross-national trends in suicide mortality rates among 10- to 19-year-olds. This study extracted suicide mortality data from the World Health Organization's (WHO) Mortality Database for the most recent year (since 2010) from any country with available high-quality data (as defined by the WHO's guidelines). Data on access to lethal means (firearms, railways) and measures of economic quality (World Bank Income Group) and inequality (Gini coefficients) were obtained from publicly available data sources. Cross-national suicide mortality rates in youth were heterogeneous. The pooled estimate across all ages, sexes, and countries was 3.77/100,000 people. The highest suicide rates were found in Estonia, New Zealand, and Uzbekistan. Suicide rates were higher among older compared with younger adolescents and higher among males than females. The most common suicide methods were hanging/suffocation and jumping/lying in front of a moving object or jumping from a height. Firearm and railway access were related to suicide deaths by firearms and jumping/lying, respectively. Economic quality and inequality were not related to overall suicide mortality rates. However, economic inequality was correlated with a higher ratio of male:female suicides. This study provides a recent update of cross-national suicide trends in adolescents. Findings replicate prior patterns related to age, sex, geographic region, and common suicide methods. New to this review are findings relating suicide method accessibility to suicide mortality rates and the significant association between income inequality and the ratio of male:female suicide. Future research directions include expanding the worldwide coverage to more low- and middle-income countries, examining demographic groupings beyond binary sex and to race/ethnicity within countries, and clarifying factors that account for cross-national differences in suicide trends.

AB Suicidal behavior and its prevention constitute a major public health issue. Etiology of suicidal behavior is multifactorial. Whereas current research is mostly focused on clinical and biological risk factors, the sociodemographic risk factors for suicidal behavior, first highlighted by Durkheim, have received less attention. Besides the well-known impact of age and gender, sociodemographic variables such as marital and parental status, education, occupation, income, employment status, religion, migration or minority status, and sexual orientation are repeatedly reported to play an important role in suicidal behavior. This narrative review aimed to summarize recent research on sociodemographic risk factors for suicidal behavior and to elicit possible implications for suicide prevention.

AB Depression-era bank suspensions and failures are conceptualized as products of the first part of what Polanyi (1994) called "The Great Transformation," which involved an imbalanced institutional arrangement in which the economy dominated other institutions Relying on Durkheim (1897/1951) and Merton (1938, 1968), it is argued that these banking problems accentuated the type of chronic anomie that Durkheim theorized would create normative deregulation and elevated suicide rates over the long-term Results from county-level analyses are supportive as the 1930 bank suspension rate is positively related to the 2000 suicide rate, controlling for contemporary and historical factors The mediating roles of integration and chronic anomie are considered, with the latter measured using data from the geocoded General Social Survey

AB Between 2011 and 2015, there was an increase in psychiatric ED visits among youth 6 to 24 years of age in the United States.
   BACKGROUND: Visits to the emergency department (ED) for psychiatric purposes are an indicator of chronic and acute unmet mental health needs. In the current study, we examined if psychiatric ED visits among individuals 6 to 24 years of age are increasing nationwide. METHODS: ED data came from the 2011-2015 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, a national survey of ED visits across the United States. Psychiatric ED visits were identified by using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and reason-for-visit codes. Survey-weighted logistic regression analyses were employed to examine trends in as well as correlates of psychiatric ED visits. Data from the US Census Bureau were used to examine population rates. RESULTS: Between 2011 and 2015, there was a 28% overall increase (from 31.3 to 40.2) in psychiatric ED visits per 1000 youth in the United States. The largest increases in psychiatric ED visits per 1000 US youth were observed among adolescents (54%) and African American (53%) and Hispanic patients (91%). A large increase in suicide-related visits (by 2.5-fold) was observed among adolescents (4.6-11.7 visits per 1000 US youth). Although psychiatric ED visits were long (51% were >= 3 hours in length), few (16%) patients were seen by a mental health professional during their visit. CONCLUSIONS: Visits to the ED for psychiatric purposes among youth are rising across the United States. Psychiatric expertise and effective mental health treatment options, particular those used to address the rising suicide epidemic among adolescents, are needed in the ED.

ID SUICIDE
AB The 2011 attempted assassination of a US representative renewed the national gun control debate. Gun advocates claim mass-casualty events are mitigated and deterred with three policies: (a) permissive gun laws, (b) widespread gun ownership, (c) and encouragement of armed civilians who can intercept shooters. They cite Switzerland and Israel as exemplars. We evaluate these claims with analysis of International Crime Victimization Survey (ICVS) data and translation of laws and original source material. Swiss and Israeli laws limit firearm ownership and require permit renewal one to four times annually. ICVS analysis finds the United States has more firearms per capita and per household than either country. Switzerland and Israel curtail off-duty soldiers' firearm access to prevent firearm deaths. Suicide among soldiers decreased by 40 per cent after the Israeli army's 2006 reforms. Compared with the United States, Switzerland and Israel have lower gun ownership and stricter gun laws, and their policies discourage personal gun ownership.

AB This study examines the correlates of suicidal ideation, suicide plan and suicide attempt among Asian Americans focusing on nativity and gender. Analyses are performed on data from the National Latino and Asian American Study (N=2095), the first ever study conducted on the mental health of a national sample of Asian Americans. The sample is comprised of adults with 998 men (47%) and 1,097 (53%) women. Analysis of weighted lifetime prevalence of suicidal behaviors revealed that U. S.-born Asian American women had higher prevelance of suicidal ideation and suicide plan than U. S.-born Asian American men and immigrant Asian American men and women. In multivariate analyses controlling for socio-demographic differences such as ethnicity, marital status and income, differences in suicidal behaviors are found only between U. S.-born women and U. S.-born men. The findings demonstrate the need to disaggregate data by immigrant status as well as socio-demographic correlates.

AB Research on suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) has identified many risk factors, but whether these findings generalize to diverse populations remains unclear. We review longitudinal studies on STB risk factors over the past 50years in the United States and evaluate the methodological practices of sampling and reporting sample characteristics. We found that articles frequently reported participant age and sex, less frequently reported participant race and ethnicity, and rarely reported participant veteran status or lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender status. Sample reporting practices modestly and inconsistently improved over time. Finally, articles predominantly featured White, non-Hispanic, young adult samples.

AB This study examines the influence of Christian religion on corporate decisions related to human rights in the United States. Specifically, it examines the empirical association between a company's human rights practices and the Christian religiosity in its local community, as well as individual CEO religiosity in the United States, both of which have not been tested in prior studies. Employing a large sample from the United States, we find a congruent association between the "human rights friendly" practices of a company and the Christian religiosity of the local community. This novel finding is robust to a diverse set of tests. In addition, we find that the association between Christian religiosity in the United States and human rights is more significant in reducing human rights concerns, than it improves human rights strengths. This study interprets these results as upholding the religious morality hypothesis, namely, that companies located in areas with higher religiosity are likely to engage in more human rights-friendly practices, and the United States. Christians consider religion as an influencing factor that encourages managers to embrace human rights. Furthermore, this study finds that individual religious managers tend toward more human rights-friendly practices, supporting our religious manager hypothesis.

AB Individuals who carry bombs on their bodies and detonate those bombs in public places are a security problem. There is belief that suicide bombings currently used in the mid-east may spread to the United States if the organized terrorist groups operating in the United States are not identified and the cell members arrested. While bombs in vehicles are the primary method currently used to spread terror in Iraq, U. S. warfighters are starting to face suicide bombers. This may become more of the situation if a stand-off detection capability is developed for the vehicle bomb case.
   This paper presents a concept, that if developed and commercialized, could provide an inexpensive suicide bomber screening system that could be used to screen individuals approaching a checkpoint while the individual is still 500 to 1,000 feet from the checkpoint. The proposed system measures both the radar cross-section of the individual and the radar derived gait characteristics that are associated with individuals carrying a bomb on their body.
   GTRI researchers propose to use human gait characteristics, as detected by radar, to determine if a human subject who is carrying no visible load on the body is actually carrying a concealed load under their clothes. The use of radar gait as a metric for the detection (as opposed to a video system) of a suicide bomber is being proposed because detection of gait characteristics are thought to be less sensitive to where the bomb is located on the body, lighting conditions, and the fact that the legs may be shrouded in a robe. The detection of a bomb using radar gait analysis may also prove to be less sensitive to changing tactics regarding where the bomb is placed on the body.
   An inert suicide bomb vest was constructed using water pipes to simulate the explosive devices. Wiring was added to simulated detonators. The vest weighs approximately 35 pounds. Radar data was taken on the volunteer subject wearing the vest that simulated the suicide bomb. This paper discusses the findings after the data was analyzed. A Provisional Patent has been filed by Georgia Tech Research Corporation on the subject matter that is discussed in this paper.

AB IMPORTANCE The rate of youth suicide has increased over the past 15 years in the United States as has the rate of death due to opioid overdose in adults of parental age.
   OBJECTIVE To explore the possible connection between parental use of prescription opioids and the increasing rate of youth suicide.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A pharmacoepidemiologic study was conducted from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2016, linking medical claims for parental opioid prescriptions with medical claims for suicide attempts by their children. The study used MarketScan medical claims data covering more than 150 million privately insured people in the United States. The study included 121306 propensity score-matched 30- to 50-year-old parents who used opioids and parents who did not use opioids and their 10- to 19-year-old children (148395 children of parents who did not use opioids and 184142 children of parents who used opioids). Propensity score matching was used to identify relevant control families based on demographic features and concomitant use of psychotropic medication.
   EXPOSURES Opioid use in a parent was defined as having prescription fills covering more than 365 days of an opioid between 2010 and 2016.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Suicide attempt rate in the children of parents who used opioids and those who did not use opioids.
   RESULTS A total of 148395 children (75575 sons and 72820 daughters; mean [SD] age, 11.5 [1.6] years at the start of follow-up) had parents who did not use opioids and 184142 children (94502 sons and 89640 daughters; mean [SD] age, 11.8 [1.8] years at the start of follow-up) with parents who did use opioids. There were 100899 children aged 10 to 14 years and 47496 children aged 15 to 19 years with parents who did not use opioids and 96975 children aged 10 to 14 years and 87163 children aged 15 to 19 years with parents who did use opioids. Of the children with parents who did not use opioids, 212 (0.14%) attempted suicide; of the children with parents who did use opioids, 678 (0.37%) attempted suicide. Parental use of opioids was associated with a doubling of the risk of a suicide attempt by their offspring (odds ratio [OR], 1.99; 95% CI, 1.71-2.33). The association remained significant after adjusting for child age and sex (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.58-2.17), addition of child and parental depression and diagnoses of substance use disorder (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.24-1.72), and addition of parental history of suicide attempt (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.23-1.71). Geographical variation in opioid use did not change the association (OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.71-2.34).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Children of parents who use prescription opioids are at increased risk for suicide attempts, which could be a contributing factor to the time trend in adolescent suicidality. The care of families with a parent who uses opioids should include mental health screening of their children.

DE Euthanasia; history of medicine; terminal care; suicide; assisted;
   Compassion and Choices
AB In the early 20th century, a political movement to secure access to euthanasia and assisted suicide began in the United States. The multitude of organizations associated with this effort has undergone an array of mergers, splits, and name changes, channeled through two progenitor organizations-the Euthanasia Society of America and the Hemlock Society. A few chronologies mapping the metamorphoses of these organizations are available, but they are not accessible in the medical literature. Moreover, they are not comprehensive, lack consistency, and are not rigorously validated. As debates about the legalization of euthanasia and assisted suicide continue, it is important to have a common understanding of the history behind these developments, including recognition of the factors driving these adaptations. In this paper, we offer a comprehensive and definitive history to aid those interested in knowing the roots of these organizations and those that are still active today.

AB In July 2007, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) partnered with the Department of Health and Human Services' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMHSA) to create the Veterans Crisis Line (VCL) in order to meet the unique needs of Veterans in distress. The current study utilized a mixed methods design to examine characteristics of male callers to the VCL. Results from qualitative analyses demonstrated that the majority of callers between April 1 and August 31, 2008 contacted the VCL with concerns related to mental health issues, suicide ideation, and substance abuse issues. Quantitative analyses demonstrated age differences associated with concerns presented by callers such that middle-aged and older callers were more likely to present with loneliness and younger callers were more likely to present with mental health concerns. The results of this study will help to inform future research designed to optimize the effectiveness of the VCL for suicide prevention in Veterans.

ID FIREARM-RELATED DEATHS; UNITED-STATES; FATALITIES
AB Two cases are reported from South Australia, where deaths occurred that were due to single self-inflicted gunshot wounds to the head in individuals who were visiting indoor firearm ranges. Case 1: A 54-year-old man visiting an indoor firing range placed a .357 magnum handgun to his head and fired one shot. Case 2: A 23-year-old woman who was being instructed in firearm usage at an indoor firing range placed a 9 mm handgun to her head and fired one shot. In both cases, deaths were due to cerebral laceration with skull fracture. Firing ranges may be utilized by individuals who are seeking weapons for suicide attempts, and suicide may be successfully undertaken at such locations even while a victim is under direct supervision. In jurisdictions, where firearm ownership is strictly legislated, it may be that clubs can inadvertently provide access to firearms for this type of activity.

AB Informed by the theories of social construction of reality and social movement, this study examined how medical journals, the publications of social movement organizations, and newspapers portrayed Jack Kevorkian in the physician-assisted suicide (PAS) and euthanasia debate. The views of core general medical journals from the United Kingdom and the United States, newsletters of pro- and anti-PAS/euthanasia groups, and local and national American newspaper coverage of Kevorkian were explored. Overall, the findings show that the voices of these different communities converged in some areas of their coverage of Kevorkian. The British medical journals (the British Medical Journal and The Lancet) and a pro-PAS/euthanasia group (the Hemlock Society) shared themes mainly with the New York Times, whereas the American journals (the Journal of the American Medical Association and New England Journal of Medicine) and an anti-PAS/euthanasia group (the International Anti-Euthanasia Task Force) shared themes mainly with the Detroit News.

AB The National College Health Assessment Survey (NCHA), sponsored by the American College Health Association, measured depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts among 15,977 college students in the academic year 1999-2000. Similar to the National College Health Risk Behavior Survey, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1995, 9.5% of students reported that they had seriously considered attempting suicide and 1.5% of students reported that they had attempted suicide within the last school year. The NCHA findings show a relationship between suicidal behavior and depressed mood. Depressed mood, difficulties of sexual identity, and problematic relationships all increase the likelihood of vulnerability to suicidal behavior. Less than 20% of students reporting suicidal ideation or attempts were receiving treatment.

AB Background: Suicide is the second leading cause of death for young Canadians (1019 years of age) - a disturbing trend that has shown little improvement in recent years. Our objective was to examine suicide trends among Canadian children and adolescents.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of standardized suicide rates using Statistics Canada mortality data for the period spanning from 1980 to 2008. We analyzed the data by sex and by suicide method over time for two age groups: 10-14 year olds (children) and 15-19 year olds (adolescents). We quantified annual trends by calculating the average annual percent change (AAPC).
   Results: We found an average annual decrease of 1.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] -1.5 to -0.4) in the suicide rate for children and adolescents, but stratification by age and sex showed significant variation. We saw an increase in suicide by suffocation among female children (AAPC = 8.1%, 95% CI 6.0 to 10.4) and adolescents (AAPC = 8.0%, 95% CI 6.2 to 9.8). In addition, we noted a decrease in suicides involving poisoning and firearms during the study period.
   Interpretation: Our results show that suicide rates in Canada are increasing among female children and adolescents and decreasing among male children and adolescents. Limiting access to lethal means has some potential to mitigate risk. However, suffocation, which has become the predominant method for committing suicide for these age groups, is not amenable to this type of primary prevention.

ID UNITED-STATES; FAMILY INTEGRATION; DIVORCE; RISK; MEN
AB Objectives-The purpose of the study was to examine the effect of marital status on the risk of suicide, using a large nationally representative sample. A related objective was to investigate the association between marital status and suicide by sex.
   Methods-Cox proportional hazards regression models were applied to data from the National Longitudinal Mortality Study, based on the 1979-1989 follow up. In estimating the effect of marital status, adjustments were made for age, sex, race, education, family income, and region of residence.
   Results-For the entire sample, higher risks of suicide were found in divorced than in married persons. Divorced and separated persons were over twice as likely to commit suicide as married persons (RR=2.08, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) 1.58, 2.72). Being single or widowed had no significant effect on suicide risk. When data were stratified by sex, it was observed that the risk of suicide among divorced men was over twice that of married men (RR=2.38, CI 1.77, 3.20). Among women, however, there were no statistically significant differentials in the risk of suicide by marital status categories.
   Conclusions-Marital status, especially divorce, has strong net effect on mortality from suicide, but only among men. The study showed that in epidemiological research on suicide, more accurate results would be obtained if samples are stratified on the basis of key demographic or social characteristics. The study further observed that failure to control for relevant socioeconomic variables or combining men and women in the same models could produce misleading results.

AB Objectives. In this study we explored the association between rates of household firearm ownership and homicide across the United States, by age groups.
   Methods. We used cross-sectional time-series data (1988-1997) to estimate the association between rates of household firearm ownership and homicide.
   Results. In region- and state-level analyses, a robust association between rates of household firearm ownership and homicide was found, Regionally, the association exists for victims aged 5 to 14 years and those 35 years and older. At the state level, the association exists for every age group over age 5, even after controlling for poverty, urbanization, unemployment, alcohol consumption, and nonlethal violent crime.
   Conclusions. Although our study cannot determine causation, we found that in areas where household firearm ownership rates were higher, a disproportionately large number of people died from homicide.

AB Mental disorders are among the strongest predictors of suicide attempts. However, little is known regarding which disorders that are uniquely associated with suicidal behavior because of high levels of psychiatric comorbidity. We examined the unique associations between individual disorders and subsequent suicidal behavior (suicide ideation, plans and attempts) using data from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication, a nationally representative household survey of 9282 US adults. Results revealed that approximately 80% of suicide attempters in the United States have a temporally prior mental disorder. Anxiety, mood, impulse-control and substance use disorders all significantly predict subsequent suicide attempts in bivariate analyses (odds ratios (OR) = 2.7-6.7); however, these associations decrease substantially in multivariate analyses controlling for comorbidity (OR= 1.5-2.3) but remain statistically significant in most cases. Disaggregation of the observed effects reveals that depression predicts suicide ideation, but not suicide plans or attempts among those with ideation. Instead, disorders characterized by severe anxiety/agitation (for example, post-traumatic stress disorder) and poor impulse control (for example, conduct disorder, substance use disorders) predict which suicide ideators who go on to make a plan or attempt. These results advance understanding of the unique associations between mental disorders and different forms of suicidal behavior. Future research must further delineate the mechanisms through which people come to think about suicide and progress from suicidal thoughts to attempts.

AB Context: In 2012, the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention's Research Prioritization Task Force (RPTF) released a series of Aspirational Goals (AGs) to decrease suicide deaths and attempts. The RPTF asked experts to summarize what was known about particular AGs and to propose research pathways that would help reach them. This manuscript describes what is known about the benefits of access to health care (AG8) and continuity of care (AG9) for individuals at risk for suicide. Research pathways are proposed to address limitations in current knowledge, particularly in U.S. healthcare-based research.
   Evidence acquisition: Using a three-step process, the expert panel reviewed available literature from electronic databases. For two AGs, the experts summarized the current state of knowledge, determined breakthroughs needed to advance the field, and developed a series of research pathways to achieve prevention goals.
   Evidence synthesis: Several components of healthcare provision have been found to be associated with reduced suicide ideation, and in some cases they mitigated suicide deaths. Randomized trials are needed to provide more definitive evidence. Breakthroughs that support more comprehensive patient data collection (e.g., real-time surveillance, death record linkage, and patient registries) would facilitate the steps needed to establish research infrastructure so that various interventions could be tested efficiently within various systems of care. Short-term research should examine strategies within the current healthcare systems, and long-term research should investigate models that redesign the health system to prioritize suicide prevention.
   Conclusions: Evidence exists to support optimism regarding future suicide prevention, but knowledge is limited. Future research is needed on U.S. healthcare services and system enhancements to determine which of these approaches can provide empirical evidence for reducing suicide.

AB The United States is engaged in ongoing dialogue around mental illness. To assess trends in this national discourse, we studied the volume and content of a random sample of 400 news stories about mental illness from the period 1995-2014. Compared to news stories in the first decade of the study period, those in the second decade were more likely to mention mass shootings by people with mental illnesses. The most frequently mentioned topic across the study period was violence (55 percent overall) divided into categories of interpersonal violence or self-directed (suicide) violence, followed by stories about any type of treatment for mental illness (47 percent). Fewer news stories, only 14 percent, described successful treatment for or recovery from mental illness. The news media's continued emphasis on interpersonal violence is highly disproportionate to actual rates of violence among those with mental illnesses. Research suggests that this focus may exacerbate social stigma and decrease support for public policies that benefit people with mental illnesses.

AB Twenty percent of deaths in the United States occur in nursing homes, yet less than 1% come to autopsy. The current study analyzed causes and manners of death in all nursing homes between 1993 and 2003, investigated by the coroner of Allegheny County, PA, which has the second highest elderly population in the United States. Two hundred eight decedents were identified, aged 19 to 91 years, 58% women and 42% men, 88% Caucasian and 22% African-American. Fifty-eight percent were accidental and 38.5% were natural manners of death, with 2 homicides, 2 suicides, and 3 undetermined cases. The manner of death was significantly different between Caucasians and African-Americans, with 92.6% of accidental deaths occurring in Caucasians and 6.6% in African-Americans (P < 0.1). Most common natural deaths were arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease, nonarteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease, pneumonia, pulmonary thromboembolism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), seizure disorder, and atraumatic intracranial hemorrhage. Blunt force trauma was the single most commonly identified traumatic accidental death. Accidental deaths were more common in Caucasians than African-Americans. Homicides and suicides were rare events (< 2%). Blunt force trauma is a major autopsy finding in accidental nursing home deaths, and a root-cause analysis may be helpful in developing policies and procedures to decrease the incidence of blunt force trauma.

AB Adults who suffer from chronic pain are at increased risk for suicide ideation and attempts, but it is not clear whether adolescents with chronic pain are similarly at elevated risk. This study investigates whether chronic pain is associated with an increase in suicidal ideation/attempts independent of depression in a population sample of adolescents. We analyzed data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, a longitudinal study of a nationally representative sample of adolescents in the United States (N = 9,970). Most chronic pain was related to suicide ideation/attempt both in the last year (odds ratio [OR] 1.3-2.1) and during the subsequent year (OR 1.2-1.8). After controlling for depressive symptoms, headaches (OR = 1.3 last year, OR = 1.2 subsequent year) and muscle aches (OR = 1.3 last year) remained associated with suicide ideation but not suicide attempt. These findings show that chronic pain in adolescence is a risk factor for suicide ideation; this effect is partly but not fully explained by depression. Youth with comorbid depression and chronic pain are at increased risk of thinking about and attempting suicide. Clinicians should be alert to suicide ideation/attempt and comorbid depression in this at-risk population. Perspective: Adolescents who suffer from chronic pain are at increased risk for suicide ideation and attempt. Depressive symptoms account for the link between chronic pain and suicide attempt, but do not completely explain why adolescents with chronic pain show suicide ideation.

AB Suicide remains a significant public health problem for the United States military. Tiauma-related diagnoses such as acute stress disorder (ASD) or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may exacerbate suicide risk, particularly among service members psychiatrically hospitalized following suicide-related events. To date, treatments to address suicide risk and trauma symptomatology among service members within inpatient milieus have been nonexistent. To address this gap, a randomizcd controlled pilot trial of Post-Admission Cognitive Therapy (PACT) was conducted to evaluate a targeted cognitive-behavioral program among traumatized military personnel (N = 36) hospitalized following a recent suicide attempt. All participants met criteria for ASD or PTSD and were randomly assigned to receive either PACT and enhanced usual care (PACT + EUC) or EUC alone. PACT consisted of six 60- to 90-min individual psychotherapy sessions, adapted from Brown et al. 's (2005) cognitive therapy protocol for suicide prevention. Blinded follow-up assessments were conducted at 1-, 2-, and 3-months postpsychiatric discharge. The primary outcome was days until repeat suicide attempt. Secondary outcomes included depression, hopelessness, suicide ideation, and PTSD symptoms. Participants did not significantly differ in reattempt status. However, based on reliable change index analyses, a greater proportion of PACT + EUC versus EUC participants met criteria for clinically significant change on measures of depression (100% vs. 78%), hopelessness (83% vs. 57%), and PTSD symptom severity (100% vs. 38%), but not for suicide ideation (60% vs. 67%). PACT is an innovative inpatient protocol, currently under evaluation in a well-powered multisite RCT for its efficacy in reducing subsequent suicidal behaviors.

TI Suicide in breast cancer patients: An individual-centered approach

AB Background. Epidemiologic studies have identified increased suicide rates among breast cancer (BC) patients. The population-based approach, however, has considerable methodic shortcomings. None of the studies have been carried out in a prospective manner and none reported suicide rates from a country in which physician-assisted suicide (PAS) is legal. Patients and methods. All cases recorded by a prospective Swiss BC database during a 17-year period (1990-2006; n = 1165) were analyzed. Using an individual-centered approach, the cases of women who committed suicide are reported according to the psychological autopsy method. Results. In six patients (0.5%; 5.1/1.000 patients), suicidal death was identified. In four patients, suicide was committed during late stages of metastatic BC. In two cases, comorbid conditions were associated with suicide. Three women chose PAS. Conclusion. The individual-centered approach is a well-suited innovative concept to increase the knowledge regarding the relationship between cancer and suicide. We found a two to seven times higher suicide rate than those reported in epidemiologic studies. The population-based approach can barely elucidate the immense variety of one of the most personal decisions: the act of intentionally ending one's own life. These studies suffer from systematic failure of analysis since they did not a) consider the potential confounding role of comorbid medical and/or psychiatric conditions, and b) report in which disease stage suicide was committed, since the decisive disease-related event whether and when metastatic disease occurred was not recorded. Furthermore, epidemiologic data stems from countries in which PAS is prohibited and therefore not included in official statistics. This grey area of medicine accounts for a greater scope of underreporting than had previously been assumed.

ID UNITED-STATES; HEALTH; DEPRESSION
AB Suicide is among the 10 most common causes of death, as assessed by the World Health Organization. For every death by suicide, an estimated 138 people's lives are meaningfully affected, and almost any other statistic around suicide deaths is equally alarming. The pervasiveness of social media-and the near-ubiquity of mobile devices used to access social media networks-offers new types of data for understanding the behavior of those who (attempt to) take their own lives and suggests new possibilities for preventive intervention. We demonstrate the feasibility of using social media data to detect those at risk for suicide. Specifically, we use natural language processing and machine learning (specifically deep learning) techniques to detect quantifiable signals around suicide attempts, and describe designs for an automated system for estimating suicide risk, usable by those without specialized mental health training (eg, a primary care doctor). We also discuss the ethical use of such technology and examine privacy implications. Currently, this technology is only used for intervention for individuals who have "opted in" for the analysis and intervention, but the technology enables scalable screening for suicide risk, potentially identifying many people who are at risk preventively and prior to any engagement with a health care system. This raises a significant cultural question about the trade-off between privacy and prevention-we have potentially life-saving technology that is currently reaching only a fraction of the possible people at risk because of respect for their privacy. Is the current trade-off between privacy and prevention the right one?

AB Aims. Korea has the highest suicide rate of developed countries, two times higher than the USA. Suicide trends among Koreans Americans living in the USA during the same period have not yet been described. We report suicide mortality rates and trends for four groups: (1) Korean Americans, (2) non-Hispanic White (NHW) Americans, (3) selected Asian American subgroups and (4) Koreans living in the Republic of Korea.
   Methods. We used US national (n = 18 113 585) and World Health Organization (WHO) (n = 232 919 253) mortality records for Korea from 2003 to 2012 to calculate suicide rates, all expressed per 100 000 persons. We assessed temporal trends and differences in age, gender and race/ethnicity using binomial regression.
   Results. Suicide rates are highest in Koreans living in the Republic of Korea (32.4 for men and 14.8 for women). Suicide rates in Korean Americans (13.9 for men and 6.5 for women) have nearly doubled from 2003 to 2012 and exceed rates for all other Asian American subgroups (5.4-10.7 for men and 1.6-4.2 for women). Suicide rates among NHWs (21.0 for men and 5.6 for women) remain high. Among elders, suicide in Korean Americans (32.9 for men and 15.4 for women) is the highest of all examined racial/ethnic groups in the USA.
   Conclusions. Suicide in Korean Americans is higher than for other Asian Americans and follows temporal patterns more similar to Korea than the USA. Interventions to prevent suicide in Korean American populations, particularly among the elderly, are needed.

   IMPACT
AB Background: Mental disorders are strongly associated with excess suicide risk, and successful treatment might prevent suicide. Since 1990, and particularly after 1998, there has been a substantial increase in mental health service resources in Norway. This study aimed to investigate whether these changes have had an impact on suicide mortality.
   Methods: We used Poisson regression analyses to assess the effect of changes in five mental health services variables on suicide mortality in five Norwegian health regions during the period 1990-2006. These variables included: number of man-labour years by all personnel, number of discharges, number of outpatient consultations, number of inpatient days, and number of hospital beds. Adjustments were made for sales of alcohol, sales of antidepressants, education, and unemployment.
   Results: In the period 1990-2006, we observed a total of 9480 suicides and the total suicide rate declined by 26%. None of the mental health services variables were significantly associated with female or male suicide mortality in the adjusted analyses (p > 0.05). Sales of antidepressants (adjusted Incidence Rate Ratio = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.97-1.00) and sales of alcohol (adjusted IRR = 1.41; 95% CI = 1.18-1.72) were significantly associated with female suicide mortality; education (adjusted IRR = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.79-0.94) and unemployment (adjusted IRR = 0.91; 95% CI = 0.85-0.97) were significantly associated with male suicide mortality.
   Conclusions: The adjusted analyses in the present study indicate that increased resources in Norwegian mental health services in the period 1990-2006 were statistically unrelated to suicide mortality.

AB Background: In Denmark, it is a political goal that 95% of all young people should complete an upper secondary education. For some young people, this goal can be difficult to achieve. An association has been established between suicidal behaviour and school performance.
   Aim: We hypothesise that young people who have attempted suicide have a lower chance of finishing secondary education.
   Methods: We used Danish historical population registers to perform a longitudinal cohort design and extended Cox regression modelling to estimate crude and adjusted estimates of the effect of suicide attempt on secondary education. We used the birth cohorts 1983-1989, and all subjects were followed from birth until the end of 2011 (n=355,725).
   Results: For suicide attempters, the likelihood of completing secondary education was one-third of non-attempters (crude hazard ratio=0.38). A part of the impact can be explained by confounding factors. Individuals with a suicide attempt at age 16-20years or with multiple suicide attempts were most likely not to complete secondary education. Compared to mentally ill non-attempters, suicide attempters with mental illness were more likely not to finish secondary education.
   Conclusion: A suicide attempt is not necessarily causal for not finishing secondary education, but it is a marker, and it predicts an increased likelihood of not finishing secondary education. We need to identify individuals at risk for suicide attempts and subsequently provide the necessary support. Completing secondary education is important, as it provides better chances of employment, higher wages and more opportunities for individuals in the future.

AB Context: A decade of increasing antidepressant medication treatment for adolescents and corresponding declines in suicide rates raise the possibility that antidepressants have helped prevent youth suicide.
   Objective: To evaluate the relationship between regional changes in antidepressant medication treatment and suicide in adolescents from 1990 to 2000.
   Design: Analysis of prescription data from the nation's largest pharmacy benefit management organization, national suicide mortality files, regional sociodemographic data from the 1990 and 2000 US Census, and regional data on physicians per capita.
   Participants: Youth aged 10 to 19 years who filled a prescription for antidepressant medication and same-aged completed suicides from 588 three-digit ZIP code regions in the United States.
   Main Outcome Measures: The relationship between regional change in antidepressant medication treatment and suicide rate stratified by sex, age group, regional median income, and regional racial composition.
   Results: There was a significant adjusted negative relationship between regional change in antidepressant medication treatment and suicide during the study period. A 1% increase in adolescent use of antidepressants was associated with a decrease of 0.23 suicide per 100 000 adolescents per year (beta = -.023, t = -5.14, P < .001). In stratified adjusted analyses, significant inverse relationships were present among males (beta = -.032, t = -3.81, P < .001), youth aged 15 to 19 years (P = -.029, t = -3.43, P < .001), and regions with lower family median incomes (P = -.023, t = -3.73, P < .001).
   Conclusions: An inverse relationship between regional change in use of antidepressants and suicide raises the possibility of a role for using antidepressant treatment in youth suicide prevention efforts, especially for males, older adolescents, and adolescents who reside in lower-income regions.

AB Suicide is a worldwide phenomenon. This review is based on a literature search of the World Health Organization (WHO) databases and PubMed. According to the WHO, in 2015, about 800,000 suicides were documented worldwide, and globally 78% of all completed suicides occur in low- and middle-income countries. Overall, suicides account for 1.4% of premature deaths worldwide. Differences arise between regions and countries with respect to the age, gender, and socioeconomic status of the individual and the respective country, method of suicide, and access to health care. During the second and third decades of life, suicide is the second leading cause of death. Completed suicides are three times more common in males than females; for suicide attempts, an inverse ratio can be found. Suicide attempts are up to 30 times more common compared to suicides; they are however important predictors of repeated attempts as well as completed suicides. Overall, suicide rates vary among the sexes and across lifetimes, whereas methods differ according to countries. The most commonly used methods are hanging, self-poisoning with pesticides, and use of firearms. The majority of suicides worldwide are related to psychiatric diseases. Among those, depression, substance use, and psychosis constitute the most relevant risk factors, but also anxiety, personality-, eating- and trauma-related disorders as well as organic mental disorders significantly add to unnatural causes of death compared to the general population. Overall, the matter at hand is relatively complex and a significant amount of underreporting is likely to be present. Nevertheless, suicides can, at least partially, be prevented by restricting access to means of suicide, by training primary care physicians and health workers to identify people at risk as well as to assess and manage respective crises, provide adequate follow-up care and address the way this is reported by the media. Suicidality represents a major societal and health care problem; it thus should be given a high priority in many realms.

AB Background: Understanding factors that contribute to high suicide risk holds important implications for prevention. We aimed to examine the sociodemographic and medical predictors of attempted suicide (severe enough to require hospitalization) and of completed suicide in a large population-based sample from a health maintenance organization (HMO) in northern California, USA. Method: We designed a cohort study, including 87,257 women and 70,570 men aged 15 through 89 years old at baseline (in 1977-1985) with follow-up for hospitalizations and mortality through the end of 1993. Results: After a median of 10 years, 169 first hospitalizations for attempted suicide (111 among women, 58 among men) and 319 completed suicides (101 among women, 218 among men) were identified. There was a greater incidence of hospitalization for suicide attempt in women than in men and, conversely, a greater incidence of completed suicide in men than in women. The predominant methods of attempted and completed suicides were ingestion of psychotropic agents and use of firearms, respectively. In gender-specific multivariate analysis of hospitalization for suicide attempt, statistically significant associations were seen for age 15-24 years (women), 65-89 years (men), white race (women), 12th grade or less education (both genders), technical/business school education (men), never being married (men), history of emotional problems (both genders), history of family problems (women), history of job problems (men) and presence of one or more comorbidities (men). The independent predictors of completed suicide were: age 15-24 years (both genders), Asian race (women), Caucasian race (both genders), never being married (both genders), being separated/divorced (women), prior inpatient hospitalization for suicide attempt (both genders) and history of emotional problems (both genders). Conclusion: These findings could help health professionals be more effective in the prevention of suicide morbidity and mortality.

AB Objective: Suicide attempts are more lethal in men than in women and this sex difference is more pronounced in old age, when suicide rates in men are highest in most countries, including the United States. To understand this sex difference, the authors assessed correlates of suicide attempt lethality in older men and women. Method: Our cross-sectional study enrolled 125 adults (84 aged 50-69 and 41 aged 70 and older) with major depression and a suicide attempt admitted to community and university hospitals in Rochester, NY. and Pittsburgh, PA. Assessments included a structured diagnostic interview, the Lethality Scale, the Suicide Intent Scale, the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) measuring burden of physical illness, and the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE). Results: Attempt lethality was higher in older (70+) than in younger (50-69) men and lower in older than in younger women. Association between suicidal intent and attempt lethality was the strongest in older men compared with the other groups. Higher attempt lethality in older men was partly explained by their higher levels of intent, and not by CIRS, MMSE, substance use disorders, or living alone. In younger, but not in older women, suicide intent was correlated with attempt lethality. Conclusion: Older men act more decisively on their suicidal intent than older women and this difference is more pronounced with increasing age. These findings might partially explain the sex differences in suicide deaths worldwide. (Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 2008; 16: 905-913)

AB Although depression and dialysis withdrawal are relatively common among individuals with ESRD, there have been few systematic studies of suicide in this population. The goals of this study were to compare the incidence of suicide with national rates and to contrast the factors associated with suicide with those associated with withdrawal in persons with ESRD. All individuals who were aged 15 yr and older and initiated dialysis between April 1, 1995, and November 30, 2000, composed the analytic cohort. Patients were censored at the time of death, transplantation, or October 31, 2001. Death as a result of suicide in the ESRD population and the general US population was ascertained from the Death Notification Form and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, respectively. Standardized incidence ratios for suicide among patient subgroups were computed using national data from the year 2000 as the reference population. The crude suicide rate from 1995 to 2001 was 24.2 suicides per 100,000 patient-years, and the overall standardized incidence ratio for suicide was 1.84 (95% confidence interval, 1.50 to 2.27). In multivariable models, age greater than or equal to 75 yr, male gender, white or Asian race, geographic region, alcohol or drug dependence, and recent hospitalization with mental illness were significant independent predictors of death as a result of suicide. Persons with ESRD are significantly more likely to commit suicide than persons in the general population. Although relatively rare, risk assessment can be used to identify patients for whom counseling and other interventions might be beneficial.

AB Background
   Many studies have reported a positive association between smoking and suicide, but the results are inconsistent. This meta-analysis was carried out to estimate the association between smoking and suicidal ideation, suicide plan, suicide attempt, and suicide death.
   Methods
   Major electronic databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and ScienceDirect were searched until May 2015. The reference lists of included studies were screened too. Epidemiological studies addressing the association between smoking and suicidal behaviors were enrolled. The heterogeneity across studies was explored by Q-test and I-2 statistic. The possibility of publication bias was assessed using Begg's and Egger's tests and Trim & Fill analysis. The results were reported based on risk ratio (RR) and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a random-effects model.
   Results
   We identified a total of 8062 references and included 63 studies with 8,063,634 participants. Compared to nonsmokers, the current smokers were at higher risk of suicidal ideation (OR = 2.05; 95% CI: 1.53, 2.58; 8 studies; I-2 = 80.8%; P<0.001), suicide plan (OR = 2.36; 95% CI: 1.69, 3.02; 6 studies; I-2 = 85.2%; P<0.001), suicide attempt (OR = 2.84; 95% CI: 1.49, 4.19; 5 studies; I-2 = 89.6%; (P<0.001), and suicide death (RR = 1.83; 95% CI: 1.64, 2.02; 14 studies; I-2 = 49.7%; P = 0.018).
   Conclusions
   There is sufficient evidence that smoking is associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviors. Therefore, smoking is a contributing factor for suicide. Although this association does not imply causation, however, smoking prevention and cessation should be the target of suicide prevention programs.

AB Objective To investigate the impact of the 2008 global economic crisis on international trends in suicide and to identify sex/age groups and countries most affected.
   Design Time trend analysis comparing the actual number of suicides in 2009 with the number that would be expected based on trends before the crisis (2000-07).
   Setting Suicide data from 54 countries; for 53 data were available in the World Health Organization mortality database and for one (the United States) data came the CDC online database.
   Population People aged 15 or above.
   Main outcome measures Suicide rate and number of excess suicides in 2009.
   Results There were an estimated 4884 (95% confidence interval 3907 to 5860) excess suicides in 2009 compared with the number expected based on previous trends (2000-07). The increases in suicide mainly occurred in men in the 27 European and 18 American countries; the suicide rates were 4.2% (3.4% to 5.1%) and 6.4% (5.4% to 7.5%) higher, respectively, in 2009 than expected if earlier trends had continued. For women, there was no change in European countries and the increase in the Americas was smaller than in men (2.3%). Rises in European men were highest in those aged 15-24 (11.7%), while in American countries men aged 45-64 showed the largest increase (5.2%). Rises in national suicide rates in men seemed to be associated with the magnitude of increases in unemployment, particularly in countries with low levels of unemployment before the crisis (Spearman's r(s)=0.48).
   Conclusions After the 2008 economic crisis, rates of suicide increased in the European and American countries studied, particularly in men and in countries with higher levels of job loss.

AB Background.-Previous cross-sectional studies reported an increased risk of suicide attempt in persons with migraine headache, which was sustained when psychiatric comorbidity was statistically controlled.
   Objective.-To estimate the risk of suicide attempt in persons with migraine vs controls with no history of severe headache, using prospective data and validated diagnostic assessment. To examine the specificity of the migraine-suicide attempt risk by comparing it to the risk associated with non-migraine headache of comparable severity and disability.
   Methods.-A cohort of persons with migraine (n = 496), non-migraine severe headaches (n = 151), and controls with no history of severe headache (n = 539) was randomly selected from the general community, assessed in 1997 and reassessed 2 years later.
   Results.-Persons with migraine had an increased risk of suicide attempt during the 2-year follow-up period, compared with controls. Odds ratio, adjusted for sex, psychiatric disorder, and previous history of suicide attempt at baseline was 4.43 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.93, 10.2). Persons with non-migraine headache of comparable intensity and disability also had an increased risk of suicide attempt, compared to controls: odds ratio, adjusted for the same covariates, was 6.20 (95% CI 2.40, 16.0). The difference between the 2 estimates was not significant. In the entire sample, headache severity at baseline predicted suicide attempt: a difference of 1 standard deviation (SD) in pain score increased the risk of suicide attempt by 79%, adjusting for sex and psychiatric disorders.
   Conclusions.-The results suggest the possibility that pain severity might account in part for the increased risk of suicide attempt associated with migraine.

AB Objectives: Cancer diagnosis is considered an independent predictor of suicide. We aimed to determine whether gender and human papillomavirus (HPV)-relatedness are associated with increased risks of suicide in the head and neck cancer (HNC) population.
   Materials and methods: Adult patients >= 18 years with HNC were selected using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data from 1973 to 2014. Using anatomic sites as proxy, patients were grouped as HPV-related or not HPV-related. Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMRs) were calculated, and association between suicide, gender, HPV-relatedness were estimated as adjusted rate ratios (aRR) using multivariable Poisson regression model.
   Results: There were 1036 suicides among 287,901 HNC patients in the study period (63 suicides per 100,000 person-years). Male patients were six times more likely to commit suicide compared to female patients (aRR = 5.74, 95% CI 3.88, 8.50); however, HPV-relatedness did not increase risk of suicide (aRR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.58, 1.29). Compared with white patients, blacks (aRR = 0.20, 95% CI 0.12, 0.33) and Hispanics (aRR = 0.25, 95% CI 0.14, 0.43) were less likely to commit suicide. Additionally, increased risks of suicide were found among the widowed (aRR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.10, 1.99) and divorced/separated (aRR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.00, 1.69), compared with married patients.
   Conclusion: Gender, not HPV-relatedness, was associated with risk of suicide in our study. We identified HNC patients more likely to commit suicide as: previously married, white, male, widowed, divorced or separated, >= 70 years. Our findings may be useful clinically in planning personalized cancer care and lifelong surveillance of HNC patients with higher risks of suicide.

ID HOMICIDE RATES; GUN OWNERSHIP; SUICIDE RATES; UNITED-STATES; CRIME;
   AVAILABILITY; ASSOCIATION; AGGRESSION; MORTALITY; ALCOHOL
AB This article critically reviews the empirical research on the association of firearm possession with suicide and homicide. Both suicide and homicide reflect intentional behavior with the goal of killing oneself or another person. Firearms provide merely a means of reaching this goal. The possession of a firearm can, therefore, not be a primary cause of either suicide or homicide. However, since a defining characteristic of both suicide and homicide is the success of killing, and since guns are more effective means for reaching this goal than poison or other weapons, the rate of firearm possession can be expected to be positively related to overall rates of suicide and homicide. This prediction has been tested with individual-level as well as macro-level studies. Individual-level studies, which typically use case-control designs, allow a better control than macro-level studies of the cultural, demographic, and economic determinants of suicide and homicide. In macro-level studies, the potential impact of gun possession on overall rates is likely to be confounded by the factors that motivate people to commit suicide or homicide. Despite these methodological limitations, the research reviewed in this article supports the assumption that easy access to firearms increases the risk of dying from violent causes. With very few exception, studies found gun ownership positively related to gun-related suicides and homicides. Furthermore, there is evidence that guns do not merely serve as substitutes for other means of killing, but increase the overall rates of suicide and homicide. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: The goal of this study is to identify alcohol-related factors that influence mortality rates from suicide. Specifically, we examine the impact of per capita consumption of total alcohol, distilled spirits, and beer and wine; unemployment rate; and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) membership rate on total and male and female suicide mortality rates in Ontario between 1968 and 1991. Method: We studied the impact of alcohol consumption levels, AA membership rates, and unemployment rates on suicide mortality rates in Ontario from 1968 to 1991. Time series analyses with Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modeling were applied to total and male and female suicide rates. The analyses performed included total alcohol consumption, distilled spirits consumption, beer consumption, and wine consumption. Missing AA membership data were interpolated with cubic splines. Results: Total alcohol consumption and consumption of each of beer, distilled spirits, and wine were significantly and positively related to total and female suicide mortality rates. AA membership rates were negatively related to total and female suicide rates. Although data for males did not reach significance (except for the relationship between wine consumption and suicide rate), the direction of effects was consistent with that observed for female and total suicide rates. Unemployment rates were positively related to male and total suicide rates in some models. Conclusions: These data confirm the important relationships between per capita consumption measures and suicide mortality rates seen by previous investigators. Additionally, the results for AA membership rates are consistent with the hypothesis that AA membership and treatment for misuse of alcohol can exert beneficial effects observable at the population level.

   INTERVENTION; DEPRESSION
AB Background: Suicide is the 11th leading cause of death and the seventh leading cause of years of potential life lost in the United States. Although suicide is of great public health significance, its clinical management is complicated.
   Purpose: The authors systematically reviewed the literature to determine whether screening for suicide risk in primary care settings decreases morbidity, mortality, or both.
   Data Sources: MEDLINE (1966 to 17 October 2002), PsycINFO, Cochrane databases, hand-searched bibliographies, and experts.
   Study Selection: For screening, only English-language studies performed in primary care settings were examined. For treatment, randomized, controlled trials and cohort studies were included if they were performed in any setting where suicide completions, suicide attempts, or suicidal ideation were reported.
   Data Extraction: A primary reviewer abstracted data on key variables of study sample, design, and outcomes; a second reviewer checked information accuracy against the original articles.
   Data Synthesis: No study directly addressed whether screening for suicide in primary care reduces morbidity and mortality. The remainder of the review focused on the questions of reliable screening tests for suicide risk and the effectiveness of interventions to decrease depression, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts or completion. One screening study provided limited evidence for the accuracy of suicide screening in a primary care setting. Intervention studies provided fair and mixed evidence that treating those at risk for suicide reduces the number of suicide attempts or completions. The evidence suggests mild to moderate improvement for interventions addressing intermediate outcomes such as suicidal ideation, decreased depressive severity, decreased hopelessness, or improved level of function.
   Conclusion: Because of the complexity of studying the risk for suicide and the paucity of well-designed research studies, only limited evidence guides the primary care clinician's assessment and management of suicide risk.

AB Introduction: Recently there was a debate concerning the etiology behind attempts and completed suicides. The aim of the current study was to search for possible correlations between the rates of attempted and completed suicide and climate variables and regional unemployment per year in the county of Thessaloniki, Macedonia, northern Greece, for the years 2000-12.
   Material and methods: The regional rates of suicide and attempted suicide as well as regional unemployment were available from previous publications of the authors. The climate variables were calculated from the daily E-OBS gridded dataset which is based on observational data
   Results: Only the male suicide rates correlate significantly with high mean annual temperature but not with unemployment. The multiple linear regression analysis results suggest that temperature is the only variable that determines male suicides and explains 51% of their variance. Unemployment fails to contribute significantly to the model. There seems to be a seasonal distribution for attempts with mean rates being higher for the period from May to October and the rates clearly correlate with temperature. The highest mean rates were observed during May and August and the lowest during December and February. Multiple linear regression analysis suggests that temperature also determines the female attempts rate although the explained variable is significant but very low (3-5%)
   Conclusion: Climate variables and specifically high temperature correlate both with suicide and attempted suicide rates but with a different way between males and females. The climate effect was stronger than the effect of unemployment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background. Suicide is the 11th leading cause of death in the USA. Suicide rates vary across ethnic groups. Whether suicide behavior differs by ethnic groups in the USA in the same way as observed for suicide death is a matter of current discussion. The aim of this report was to compare the lifetime prevalence of suicide ideation and attempt among four main ethnic groups (Asians, Blacks, Hispanics, and Whites) in the USA.
   Method. Suicide ideation and attempts were assessed using the World Mental Health version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI). Discrete time survival analysis was used to examine risk for lifetime suicidality by ethnicity and immigration among 15 180 participants in the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiological Surveys (CPES), a group of cross-sectional surveys.
   Results. Suicide ideation was most common among Non-Hispanic Whites (16.10%), least common among Asians (9.02%) and intermediate among Hispanics (11.35%) and Non-Hispanic Blacks (11.82%). Suicide attempts were equally common among Non-Hispanic Whites (4.69%), Hispanics (5.11%) and Non-Hispanic Blacks (4.15%) and less common among Asians (2.55%). These differences in the crude prevalence rates of suicide ideation decreased but persisted after control for psychiatric disorders, but disappeared for suicide attempt. Within ethnic groups, risk for suicidality was low among immigrants prior to migration compared to the US born, but equalized over time after migration.
   Conclusions. Ethnic differences in suicidal behaviors are explained partly by differences in psychiatric disorders and low risk prior to arrival in the USA. These differences are likely to decrease as the US-born proportion of Hispanics and Asians increases.

AB Purpose: To examine the association between self-reported alcohol use and suicide attempts among adolescents who did and did not report suicidal ideation during the past year.
   Methods: Screening data from 31,953 students attending schools in the United States that implemented the Signs of Suicide (SOS) program in 2001-2002 were used in this analysis. Two types of alcohol use were investigated: heavy episodic drinking, and drinking while down. Self-reported suicide attempts were regressed on suicidal ideation and both measures of alcohol use, controlling for participants' levels of depressive symptoms, and demographic characteristics.
   Results: Logistic regression analyses indicated that both drinking while down and heavy episodic drinking were significantly associated with self-reported suicide attempts, Analyses examining the conditional association of alcohol use and suicidal ideation with self-reported suicide attempts revealed that drinking while down was associated with significantly greater risk of suicide attempt among those not reporting suicidal ideation in the past year. Heavy episodic drinking was associated with increased risk of suicide attempt equally among those who did and did not report suicidal ideation.
   Conclusions: This study identified the use of alcohol while sad or depressed as a marker for suicidal behavior in adolescents who did not report ideating prior to an attempt, and hence, may not be detected by current strategies for assessing suicide risk. Findings from this study should provide further impetus for alcohol screening among clinicians beyond that motivated by concerns about alcohol and substance use.

AB Objective: Suicide is a leading cause of death for college students. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors of suicide among college students that could improve university services to help prevent college suicide.
   Methods: We conducted a 23-year serial prevalence study of the prevalence and characteristics of death and suicide among 8,262,314 Japanese college students. We analyzed rates of suicide from the 1989 to 1990 academic year through the 2011-2012 academic year and characterized suicide among this population, focusing on students' sex and psychiatric and academic backgrounds to identify risk factors for suicide.
   Results: Suicide rates increased throughout the 23 years, and suicide was the leading cause of death every year from 1996 onward. Suicide accounted for 42.4% of all deaths that happened in the 23 years. Male students, medicine majors, students in the final year of their program, and students who completed extra years of schooling or took academic leaves of absence were at higher risk for suicide. Only 16.4% had received an official psychiatric diagnosis and 16.0% had received services through the university health center prior to the suicides.
   Conclusions: Results suggest the need for a stronger support system for college students. Areas for improvement could include better advertising of mental health services, student and staff education about suicide risk factors, and mentorship and outreach programs for students in their final year of classes, those majoring in medicine, and those who have taken leaves of absence or failed classes. Accommodations at the administrative level would also be helpful for students who need to retake classes or transfer credit. (C) Copyright 2017 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

   SEPARATION; COURTS; LAW; JUSTICIABILITY; ENFORCEMENT; POWERS
AB State suits against the federal government are on the rise. From Massachusetts' challenge to federal environmental policy, to Oregon's confrontation over physician-assisted suicide, to Texas's suit over the Obama administration's immigration program, States increasingly go to court to express their disagreement with federal policy. This Article offers a new theory of state standing that seeks to explain when a State may sue the United States. I argue that States have broad standing to sue the federal government to protect state law. Accordingly, a State may challenge federal statutes or regulations that preempt, or otherwise undermine the continued enforceability of state law. But, contrary to many scholars and jurists, I contend that States do not have a special interest in overseeing the manner in which federal agencies implement federal law. The Supreme Court was therefore wrong to suggest that States deserve "special solicitude" in the standing analysis when they seek to ensure that the federal executive abides by congressional mandates. States have special standing to protect federalism principles, not the constitutional separation of powers.

TI Who uses firearms as a means of suicide? A population study exploring
   firearm accessibility and method choice
SO BMC MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; GUN OWNERSHIP; RATES; HOMICIDE; ACCESS; AUSTRALIA;
   IMPACT; ASSOCIATION; LEGISLATION; PREVENTION
AB Background: The 1996 Australian National Firearms Agreement introduced strict access limitations. However, reports on the effectiveness of the new legislation are conflicting. This study, accessing all cases of suicide 1997-2004, explores factors which may impact on the choice of firearms as a suicide method, including current licence possession and previous history of legal access.
   Methods: Detailed information on all Queensland suicides (1997-2004) was obtained from the Queensland Suicide Register, with additional details of firearm licence history accessed from the Firearm Registry (Queensland Police Service). Cases were compared against licence history and method choice (firearms or other method). Odds ratios (OR) assessed the risk of firearms suicide and suicide by any method against licence history. A logistic regression was undertaken identifying factors significant in those most likely to use firearms in suicide.
   Results: The rate of suicide using firearms in those with a current license (10.92 per 100,000) far exceeded the rate in those with no license history (1.03 per 100,000). Those with a license history had a far higher rate of suicide (30.41 per 100,000) compared to that of all suicides (15.39 per 100,000). Additionally, a history of firearms licence (current or present) was found to more than double the risk of suicide by any means (OR = 2.09, P < 0.001). The group with the highest risk of selecting firearms to suicide were older males from rural locations.
   Conclusion: Accessibility and familiarity with firearms represent critical elements in determining the choice of method. Further licensing restrictions and the implementation of more stringent secure storage requirements are likely to reduce the overall familiarity with firearms in the community and contribute to reductions in rates of suicide.

AB This article presents findings and recommendations for journalists and educators based on a study of more than 20 years' reporting of infanticide, filicide and family murder-suicide in the United Kingdom's national and regional press. On average, 50 children die each year at the hands of parents in the United Kingdom, and the deaths receive significant media attention. This study finds journalists exhibit a gender-biased trend in their writing depending on the sex of the perpetrator. Furthermore, most media coverage fails to acknowledge that killings by men are often the culmination of long-term domestic violence. Findings suggest news values and sourcing strategies are distorting the true picture and foregrounding tragedy narratives for the predominantly male perpetrators, often blaming women for leading a loving father to "snap". In sharp contrast, mothers who kill are more negatively portrayed. The research finds that crime reporters need training in domestic violence to look beyond simplistic stereotypes.

ID ADOLESCENTS; STUDENTS; DEPRESSION; RISK
AB Purpose: To determine whether involvement in bullying as a perpetrator, victim, or both victim and perpetrator (victim-perpetrator) was associated with a higher risk of suicidal ideation or suicide attempts among a multiethnic urban high school population in the United States.
   Methods: In 2008, a total of 1,838 youth in 9th-12th grades attending public high school in Boston, MA, completed an in-school, self-reported survey of health-related behaviors. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between bullying behaviors and self-reported suicidal ideation and suicide attempts within the 12 months preceding the survey.
   Results: Students who reported having been involved in bullying as a perpetrator, victim, or victim-perpetrator were more likely than those who had not been involved in bullying to report having seriously considered or attempted suicide within the past year. When age, race/ethnicity, and gender were controlled, students who were victim-perpetrators of bullying were at highest risk for both suicidal ideation and suicide attempt.
   Conclusions: Urban youth who have been bullied as well as those who have bullied others are at increased risk of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. (C) 2012 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

TI Suicide and Ambient Temperature: A Multi-Country Multi-City Study
SO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
LA English
DT Article
ID SOUTH-AFRICA; MORTALITY; SEASONALITY; RATES; ASSOCIATION; ENGLAND
AB BACKGROUND: Previous literature suggests that higher ambient temperature may play a role in increasing the risk of suicide. However, no multicountry study has explored the shape of the association and the role of moderate and extreme heat across different locations.
   OBJECTIVES: We examined the short-term temperature suicide relationship using daily time-series data collected for 341 locations in 12 countries for periods ranging from 4 to 40 y.
   METHODS: We conducted a two-stage meta-analysis. First, we performed location-specific time-stratified case-crossover analyses to examine the temperature suicide association for each location. Then, we used a multivariate meta-regression to combine the location-specific lag-cumulative nonlinear associations across all locations and by country.
   RESULTS: A total of 1,320,148 suicides were included in this study. Higher ambient temperature was associated with an increased risk of suicide in general, and we observed a nonlinear association (inverted J-shaped curve) with the highest risk at 27 degrees C. The relative risk (RR) for the highest risk was 1.33 (95% CI: 1.30, 1.36) compared with the risk at the first percentile. Country-specific results showed that the nonlinear associations were more obvious in northeast Asia (Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan). The temperature with the highest risk of suicide ranged from the 87th to 88th percentiles in the northeast Asian countries, whereas this value was the 99th percentile in Western countries (Canada, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, and the United Slates) and South Africa, where nearly linear associations were estimated. The country-specific RRs ranged from 1.31 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.44) in the United States to 1.65 (95% CI: 1.40, 1.93) in Taiwan, excluding countries where the results were substantially uncertain.
   DISCUSSION: Our findings showed that the risk of suicide increased with increasing ambient temperature in many countries, but to varying extents and not necessarily linearly. This temperature suicide association should be interpreted cautiously, and further evidence of the relationship and modifying factors is needed.

TI Population-based outreach versus care as usual to prevent suicide

   ADULTS; DEATH
AB Background: Suicide remains the 10th-ranked most frequent cause of death in the United States, accounting for over 40,000 deaths per year. Nonfatal suicide attempts lead to over 200,000 hospitalizations and 600,000 emergency department visits annually. Recent evidence indicates that responses to the commonly used Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) can identify outpatients who are at risk of suicide attempt and suicide death and that specific psychotherapy or Care Management programs can prevent suicide attempts in high-risk patients. Motivated by these developments, the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network has undertaken a multisite trial of two outreach programs to prevent suicide attempts among outpatients identified by routinely administered PHQ9 questionnaires.
   Methods/design: Outpatients who are at risk of suicide attempt are automatically identified using data from electronic health records (EHRs). Following a modified Zelen design, all those identified are assigned to continued usual care (i.e., no contact) or to be offered one of two population-based outreach programs. A Care Management intervention includes systematic outreach to assess suicide risk, EHR-based tools to implement risk-based care pathways, and care management to facilitate recommended follow-up. A Skills Training intervention includes interactive online training in Dialectical Behavior Therapy skills, supported by reminder and reinforcement messages from a skills coach. Each intervention supplements, rather than replaces, usual care; participants may receive any other services normally available. Interventions are delivered primarily by secure messaging through EHR patient portals. Suicide attempts and deaths following randomization are identified using state vital statistics data and health system EHR and insurance claim data. Primary evaluation will compare risk of suicide attempt or death over 18 months according to the initial assignment, regardless of intervention participation. Recruitment is underway in three health systems (Group Health Cooperative, HealthPartners, and Kaiser Permanente Colorado). Over 2500 participants have been randomized as of 1 March 2016, with enrollment averaging approximately 100 per week.
   Discussion: Assessing the effectiveness of population-based suicide prevention requires adherence to the principles of pragmatic trials: population-based enrollment, accepting variable treatment participation, assessing outcomes using health record data, and analyses based on intent-to-treat.

AB The relationship between suicide and social class has proved to be complex. Durkheim predicted suicide rates would increase with social status, while others thought the opposite. Results have been mixed. In some studies, suicidality has increased with increasing social status, and in other studies, the two variables have had an inverse relationship. These studies have been primarily conducted on general non-psychiatric populations The present study, in contrast, examines this relationship on a 20-year prospective longitudinal sample of 400 psychiatric patients (differentiated by psychiatric diagnosis) after index hospitalization. Of these, 160 patients show some sign of suicide risk (87 cases of suicidal ideation, 41 of suicide attempts, and 32 suicide completions). A complicated pattern emerges across psychiatric diagnosis, gender, and race. The great majority of patients show no statistically significant relationship between social status and suicide risk. At the maximally different extremes, however, a dramatic difference does emerge. White women diagnosed with nonpsychotic depression show a positive relationship between social status and suicide risk (p < .01) while black men diagnosed with schizophrenia show a negative relationship between these 2 variables (p < .02). The relationship between social status and suicidality among psychiatric patients varies across race, gender, and psychiatric diagnosis. More research needs to be done on this complex and important topic, especially with regard to samples of psychiatric patients. The role of anomie should be studied.

AB Suicide is a leading cause of death for vulnerable ethnic minority emerging adults in the United States (Web-based injury statistics query and reporting system [WISQARS], 2015). Perceived discrimination (Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 40, 2011, 1465) and anxiety symptoms (Asian American Journal of Psychology, 1, 2010, 18) are two predictors that are theoretically and conceptually related, but have yet to be examined in a simultaneous model for suicide ideation. Existing theory and research suggest that these variables activate similar pathways (American Behavioral Scientist, 51, 2007, 551). This study sought to address this gap in the literature by examining the simultaneous relationship between perceived discrimination and anxiety symptoms as predictors of suicide ideation. The moderating effect of anxiety symptoms on the relationship between perceived discrimination and suicide ideation was examined in a multiethnic sample of emerging adults. Results indicated that anxiety symptoms moderated the perceived discrimination-suicide ideation relationship for Hispanic emerging adults, but not for their Asian American and African American counterparts. Furthermore, ethnic identity has been shown to mitigate suicide risk in the face of other stressors (Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology, 14, 2008, 75). Ethnic identity emerged as a protective factor for Hispanic emerging adults by further interacting with perceived discrimination and anxiety symptoms to negatively predict suicide ideation. The implications of these findings are discussed.

   INTEGRATION
AB Russian levels of alcohol consumption and suicide are among the highest in the world. While observers have long suspected an association between the two, they were unable to investigate this hypothesis until recently due to past Soviet secrecy and thus a lack of data. This study took advantage of the newly available data during the post-Soviet era to examine the cross-sectional association between heavy drinking and suicide mortality in Russia. Aggregate mortality data for the Russian regions (n = 78) for the year 2000 were used to measure heavy drinking and suicide rates. Government data were used to control for the regional economic situation and strength of social institutions. Ordinary Least Squares regression was employed to estimate the effect of a proxy for heavy drinking on overall and sex-specific age-adjusted suicide rates. The results showed a positive and significant association between the two, and the association held for overall, male and female rates. These results not only confirmed an association between heavy drinking and suicide in Russia, but when compared to findings from previous studies of other countries they led to the hypothesis that a nation's beverage preference may be as important as its wet/dry drinking culture in the sensitivity of its suicide rates to alcohol consumption.

AB Background: Surveillance systems capturing instances of self-directed violence (SDV) continue to lack uniform nomenclature and classification methodology. Aims: To apply and compare two retrospective surveillance approaches to youth experiencing SDV presenting to two urban hospitals with Level I Trauma Centers. Method: Two suicide attempt surveillance methods where retrospectively applied to our SDV cohort: (a) a rigorous method facilitated by medical record review and application of standardized classification: and (b) a common surveillance method conducted by systematic queries of suicide attempt key terms and diagnosis codes among hospital databases. Results: Rigorous surveillance identified 249 patients attempting suicide. The common method's querying suicide attempt in the chief complaint field had a high positive predictive value and specificity; however, sensitivity was low. Limitations: Authors were unable to determine whether all SDV encounters during the study timeframe were identified for initial screening owing to the hospital's lack of a uniform nomenclature or classification system. Conclusion: Results showed underreporting of suicide attempt cases, inadequate sensitivity and specificity in common surveillance methods, and skewed demographic representation compared with the rigorous surveillance method.This study elucidates the negative impact of inconsistent SDV nomenclature including impeding effective patient identification, treatment, surveillance, and generalizable research.

LA English
DT Article
ID DIAGNOSES
AB Background: Suicide is a leading cause of death for children and youth in the United States. Although school based programs have been the principal vehicle for youth suicide prevention efforts for over two decades, few have been systematically evaluated. This study examined the effectiveness of the Signs of Suicide (SOS) prevention program in reducing suicidal behavior.
   Methods: 4133 students in 9 high schools in Columbus, Georgia, western Massachusetts, and Hartford, Connecticut were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups during the 2001-02 and 2002-03 school years. Self-administered questionnaires were completed by students in both groups approximately 3 months after program implementation.
   Results: Significantly lower rates of suicide attempts and greater knowledge and more adaptive attitudes about depression and suicide were observed among students in the intervention group. Students' race/ethnicity, grade, and gender did not alter the impact of the intervention on any of the outcomes assessed in this analysis.
   Conclusion: This study has confirmed preliminary analysis of Year 1 data with a larger and more racially and socio-economically diverse sample. SOS continues to be the only universal school-based suicide prevention program to demonstrate significant effects of self-reported suicide attempts in a study utilizing a randomized experimental design. Moreover, the beneficial effects of SOS were observed among high school-aged youth from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds, highlighting the program's utility as a universal prevention program.

AB Suicide is a leading cause of death and represents a serious public health concern. However, our ability to predict its occurrence has not improved over the last 50 years and we continue to rely on past suicidal behavior as the most robust predictor of future suicidal behavior. Recent theories have emphasized the role of contextual factors that increase capability to act on suicidal thoughts, including access to and familiarity with lethal means. We sought to examine the impact of handgun ownership, a component of practical capability as defined by the Three-Step Theory, on the relationship between past week suicidal ideation and perceived likelihood of making a future suicide attempt within a community sample of previous suicide attempters. Results indicate that, among suicide attempt survivors who are currently suicidal, handgun ownership increases the likelihood of predicting engagement in future suicidal behavior. As self-reported predictions about suicidal behavior have been found to be uniquely predictive of actual suicidal behavior, handgun ownership may facilitate the transition from ideation to action. The relevance of these findings to means safety strategies is discussed.

AB Objectives. -To determine the specific clinical. aspects of patients with suicidal. firearm and investigate the specificities of the suicide method.
   Background. - Suicidal behaviour represents a major public health problem throughout the world. Attempted suicide and completed suicide by firearms rates are very high both in Europe and in the United States. Preventive aspects presently preoccupy the physicians and the politicians. However, methods of suicide are understudied in Europe for the benefit of psychopathological and epidemiological aspects of suicide. Only a minority of studies enquire into the clinical, aspects according to the method of suicide. Nevertheless, most of the international studies have already demonstrated the efficacy of reducing the accessibility of weapons.
   Methods. -A retrospective study including suicide attempters by firearm hospitalized in the general hospital of Poitiers between 1992 and 2005.
   Results. - We included 161 patients with self-inflicted gunshot wounds, among which 88% of patients were mates. Most of them did not Live alone and had children. Some of them had a past history of attempted suicide, some of them using a violent method. The acting out has mostly been committed at home and the firearm used was frequently a hunting gun. Interpersonal conflicts have been mostly reported by the patient with self-inflicted gunshot wounds. The prevalence of alcoholic behaviour and major depression is very important. Personality disorders are overrepresented in the study, notably paranoiac and borderline disorders.
   Discussion. - Our sample is one of the largest compared to the other studies that often did not exceed 30 patients. Some results are contrary to those of populations of suicide attempters, whereas there are some similarities within the completed suicide population. Finally, paranoiac personality disorder is significantly associated with suicidal behaviour by firearm.
   Conclusions. - Some clinical characteristics have been reported as far as suicide attempters by firearm are concerned. Actually, there are some significant differences between suicide attempters by firearm and other suicide attempters. These results are very important for the perspective of preventing suicidal behaviour. However, it is essential to continue studies on the clinical aspects according to the method used in attempted and completed suicide. (C) L'Encephale, Paris, 2008.

AB The current study investigated the relationship of suicide and homicide rates internationally. WHO database mortality data for 82 countries concerning suicide, homicides, and cancer and traffic accidents as controls were used. The analysis included Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analysis. Worldwide homicidal rates explained 55.42%, 43.86% and 41.7% of male and 22.0%, 22.14% and 13.25% of female suicides for 2000, 2005 and 2010 respectively. In Europe there was a positive correlation between male suicide rates and all homicide rates including homicide rates in both genders, in male victims, and in female victims. In America there is no significant correlation. In Asia there is a significant correlation of male suicidal rates only with homicide rates of female victims. We observed marked and interesting differences in the pattern of association between Europe and the Americas. Overall the current paper suggests that at least in some human populations, suicidality and homicidality share common etiopathogenetic substrates and could be triggered by the same internal or external events or might develop based on common genetic background. Empirically it has been suggested that suicide is related to higher living standards while murder is related to poor quality of life and lower living standards.

AB Current efforts at suicide prevention center largely on reducing suicidal desire among individuals hospitalized for suicidality or being treated for related psychopathology. Such efforts have yielded evidence-based treatments, and yet the national suicide rate has continued to climb. We propose that this disconnect is heavily influenced by an unmet need to consider population-level interventions aimed at reducing the capability for suicide. Drawing on lessons learned from other public health phenomena that have seen drastic declines in frequency in recent decades (HIV, lung cancer, motor vehicle accidents), we propose that current suicidality treatment efforts trail current suicidality theories in their lack of focus on the extent to which individuals thinking about suicide are capable of transitioning from ideation to attempt. We summarize extant evidence for specific capability-centered approaches (e.g., means safety) and propose other options for improving our ability to address this largely overlooked variable. We also note that population-level approaches in this regard would represent an important opportunity to decrease risk in individuals who either lack access to evidence-based care or underreport suicidal ideation, as a reduced capability for suicide would theoretically diminish the potency of suicidal desire and, in this sense, lower the odds of a transition from ideation to attempt.

AB Suicide prevention is a National Health Service priority in the United Kingdom. People with mental illness are seen to represent one of the most vulnerable groups for suicide and recent British Government policy has focused on prevention and management of perceived risk. This approach to suicide prevention is constructed under a biomedical model of psychiatry, which maintains that suicidal persons suffer from some form of disease or irrational drive towards self-destruction. Many react to the idea of self-inflicted death with instinctive revulsion, which has prevented serious discussion of the concept of rational suicide, particularly in relation to those with schizophrenia. The idea that there may be circumstances in which suicide can be viewed as rational is discussed within the biomedical approach to ethics and wider literature primarily in relation to physical disease, terminal states and chronic pain. It is not deemed a viable choice for those who are considered 'non-autonomous' due to the controlling forces of mental illness. I propose that suicide is not a consequence of mental illness per se, and that it may be seen as a rational response to a realistic perspective on the course and consequences of living with schizophrenia. The denial of dialogue about the validity of suicidal ideation for people with schizophrenia has led to negative consequences for people with serious mental illness in terms of justice and recognition of person-hood.

AB IMPORTANCE The United States has higher infant and youth mortality rates than other high-income countries, with striking disparities by racial/ethnic group. Understanding changing trends by age and race/ethnicity for leading causes of death is imperative for focused intervention.
   OBJECTIVE To estimate trends in US infant and youth mortality rates from 1999 to 2015 by age group and race/ethnicity, identify leading causes of death, and compare mortality rates with Canada and England/Wales.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This descriptive study analyzed death certificate data from the US National Center for Health Statistics, Statistics Canada, and the UK Office of National Statistics for all deaths among individuals younger than 25 years. The study took place from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2015, and analyses started in September 2017.
   EXPOSURES Race/ethnicity.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Average annual percent changes in mortality rates from 1999 to 2015 and absolute rate change between 1999 to 2002 and 2012 to 2015 for each age group, race/ethnicity, and cause of death.
   RESULTS Among individuals from birth to age 24 years, 1169 537 deaths occurred in the United States, 80 540 in Canada, and 121183 in England/Wales from 1999 to 2015. In the United States, 64% of deaths occurred in male individuals and 52.6% occurred in white individuals (25.1% deaths occurred in black individuals and 17.9% in Latino individuals). All-cause mortality declined for all age groups (infants younger than 1 year [38.5% of deaths], children aged 1-9 years [10.6%], early adolescents aged 10-14 years [5%], late adolescents aged 15-19 years [17.7%], and young adults aged 20-24 years [28.1%]) in the United States, Canada, and England/Wales from 1999 to 2015. However, rates were highest in the United States. Within the United States, annual declines in all-cause mortality rates occurred among all age groups of black, Latino, and white individuals, except for white individuals aged 20 to 24 years, whose rates remained stable. Mortality rates declined across most major causes of death from 1999 to 2002 and 2012 to 2015, with notable declines observed for sudden infant death syndrome, unintentional injury death, and homicides. Among infants, unintentional suffocation and strangulation in bed increased (difference between 2012-2015 and 1999-2002 range, 6.11-29.03 per 100 000). Further, suicide rates among Latino and white individuals aged 10 to 24 years (range, 0.21-2.63 per 100 000) and black individuals aged 10 to 19 years (range, 0.10-0.45 per 100 000) increased, as did unintentional injury deaths in white young adults (0.79 per 100 000). The rise in unintentional injury deaths is attributed to increases in drug poisonings and was also observed in black and Latino young adults.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Mortality rates in the United States have generally declined for infants and youths from 1999 to 2015 owing to reductions in sudden infant death syndrome, unintentional injury death, and homicides. However, US mortality rates remain higher than Canada and England/Wales, with particularly elevated rates among black and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth. Further, there is a concerning increase in suicide and drug poisoning death rates among US adolescents and young adults.

AB The landmark report, Responding to Grief, Trauma, and Distress After a Suicide: U.S. National Guidelines, identifies the suicide bereaved as an underserved population and recommends systematic development of peer grief support to help meet the needs of survivors of suicide loss. A widespread array of peer grief support after suicide (PGSS) services exists nationally, but only as a decentralized network of autonomous programs. Some research indicates that peer support is generally helpful to the suicide bereaved, a finding that is reinforced by a large body of emerging research showing that peer support is effective in mental illness and substance abuse recovery. The practice, study, growth, and refinement of peer support in those fields have generated viable ideas about the elements and principles of effective peer support-for individual practitioners and for programs and organizations-that could be used to guide the systematic implementation of PGSS. In addition, a comprehensive PGSS program (Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors) that currently serves a large population-survivors of suicide in the military-could be a model for national PGSS systems development. Finally, there are several frameworks for systems development-zero suicide, consumer-operated services, recovery-oriented systems of care, and the consumer action research model-that could guide the expansion and increased effectiveness of PGSS in keeping with the Guidelines' recommendation.

AB Objectives. We examined cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between asthma, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempt among adults in the community.
   Methods. Data were drawn from 3 waves (1981,1982,1993-1996) of the Baltimore follow-up of the Epidemiologic Catchment Area study. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to examine associations between asthma, asthma treatment, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and suicide completion.
   Results. Asthma at wave 1 was associated with a significantly increased odds of suicidal ideation (odds ratio [OR]=2.33; confidence interval [Cl]=1.03, 5.25) and suicide attempt (OR=3.54; Cl= 1.4, 8.99), which persisted independent of lifetime National Institute of Mental Health Diagnostic Interview Schedule/Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition major depression and treatment for asthma at wave 2.
   Conclusions. These findings provide preliminary evidence suggestive of an association between asthma and an increased likelihood of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt among adults in the community. Neither lifetime major depression nor treatment for asthma explained this relation. These results provide important directions for future research, and if replicated these data may have clinical and public health implications.

AB In order to assess the potential benefit in human lives if all geographical regions in the US (Northeast, South, Midwest, and West) achieved the lowest suicide and homicide rates observed within these regions, age-, race- and gender-adjusted suicide and homicide rates for each of the four regions were calculated based on data retrieved using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention database for 1999-2004. Data on known risk factors were retrieved from online sources. Overall suicide rates (10.42 per 100,000) exceeded homicide rates (6.97 per 100,000). Almost 27% (12,942 lives per year) of the 288,222 suicide and homicide deaths during the study period might have been avoided if all US regions achieved the mortality rate reported by the Northeast. A firearm was used in 55% of all suicides and 66% of all homicides. In the total estimate of avoidable deaths, firearm suicides (90%) and firearm homicides (75%) were overrepresented. The Northeast had the lowest access to firearms (20%) contrasted to almost double in the other regions, whereas greater firearms availability was related to unrestricted firearm legislation. Measures to restrict firearms availability should be highly prioritized in the public health agenda in order to achieve an impressive benefit in human lives. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Background: Decreased binding capacity of SERT in the prefrontal cortex has been observed in both suicide victims and suicide attempters. Moreover, some studies have shown that SERT has a seasonal variation with lower binding capacity in the spring and summer, which coincides with a seasonal peak of suicides. Our aim was to explore whether the season of treatment initiation with antidepressants is associated with suicide or suicide attempt and compare it with the underlying suicide seasonality in the general population.
   Methods: Using Swedish registers, patients who initiated treatment with an antidepressant were followed up to three months for suicidal behavior. Cox regression analyses were used. Results were compared with the underlying seasonal pattern by calculating standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for suicides and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for suicide attempts.
   Results: Patients aged years had higher risk for suicide when initiating antidepressant treatment in the summer, and also a higher risk for suicide attempt when initiating treatment in the spring and summer. Young patients (0-24 years) presented a higher risk for suicide attempt when initiating treatment in the autumn. Patients with previous suicide attempt had a seasonal pattern, with a higher risk to carry out a suicide attempt in the summer and autumn. Results from the SMR and SIR calculations numerically support these findings.
   Limitations: We used information of filling an antidepressant prescription as a proxy of actual antidepressant treatment. Patients with combination, augmentation therapy or those switching antidepressant during followup were excluded. Thus, our results refer to less complicated psychopathology.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate an interaction between biological and health care-related factors for the observed seasonal pattern of suicidal behavior in the elderly, whereas psychological and societal factors may be more important for the seasonality observed in the younger patients.

DT Article
ID HOUSEHOLD FIREARM OWNERSHIP; RISK-FACTORS; UNITED-STATES; VIOLENT DEATH;
   PATTERNS; RATES; HOME
AB Suicide is a major, preventable public health issue. Although firearm-related mechanisms commonly result in death, nonfirearm methods cause significant morbidity and healthcare expenditures. The goal of this study is to compare risk factors and outcomes of firearm and nonfirearm traumatic suicide methods. This retrospective cohort study identified 146 patients who attempted traumatic suicide between 2002 and 2007 at a Level I trauma center. Overall, mean age was 40.2 years, 83 per cent were male, 74 per cent were white, and mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 12.7. Most individuals (53%) attempted suicide by firearms and 25 per cent died (84% firearm, 16% nonfirearm. techniques). Subjects were more likely to die if they were older than 60 years-old, presented with an ISS greater than 16, or used a firearm. On average, patients using a firearm were older and had a higher ISS and mortality rate compared with those using nonfirearm methods. There was no statistical difference between cohorts with regard to gender, ethnicity, positive drug and alcohol screens, requirement for operation, intensive care unit admission, and hospital length of stay. Nonfirearm traumatic suicide prevention strategies aimed at select individuals may decrease overall attempts, reduce mechanism-related mortality, and potentially impact healthcare expenditures.

TI Suicide compared to other causes of mortality in physicians
SO SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL-CLASS; DEPRESSION; GENDER
AB Physicians frequently are early adopters of healthy behaviors based on their knowledge and economic resources. The mortality patterns of physicians in the United States, particularly suicide, have not been rigorously described for over a decade. Previous studies have shown lower all-cause mortality among physicians yet reported conflicting results about cause-specific mortality such as suicide. In this study, we compared all-cause and cause-specific mortality in a sample of physicians to the age-gender matched general U.S. population from 1948 through 1998. We also compared the mortality experience across medical specialities. The risk of all-cause mortality was 56% lower than expected in men, and 26% lower in women, compared to the general population. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were markedly lower for diseases strongly linked to smoking, e.g., cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and lung cancer. Suicide was the only cause of death where risk was greater than the general population. Overall, we found that physicians are at substantially lower risk of dying compared to the general population for all causes of death except suicide. The findings for suicide are strikingly different than other causes of death and should provide impetus for new research on the mental health of physicians.

   POLICE; VIOLENCE; SUICIDE; TRENDS; US; AVAILABILITY
AB Objectives. In the United States, state firearm ownership has been correlated with homicide rates. More than 90% of homicides of law enforcement officers (LEOs) are committed with firearms. We examined the relationship between state firearm ownership rates and LEO occupational homicide rates.
   Methods. We obtained the number LEOs killed from 1996 to 2010 from a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) database. We calculated homicide rates per state as the number of officers killed per number of LEOs per state, obtained from another FBI database. We obtained the mean household firearm ownership for each state from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.
   Results. Using Poisson regression and controlling for factors known to affect homicide rates, we associated firearm ownership with the homicide rates for LEOs (incidence rate ratio = 1.044; P =.005); our results were supported by cross-sectional and longitudinal sensitivity analyses. LEO homicide rates were 3 times higher in states with high firearm ownership compared with states with low firearm ownership.
   Conclusions. High public gun ownership is a risk for occupational mortality for LEOs in the United States. States could consider methods for reducing firearm ownership as away to reduce occupational deaths of LEOs.

AB Although suicide-related outcomes among Asian American adolescents are a serious public health problem in the United States, research in this area has been relatively sparse. To address this gap in the empirical literature, this study examined subgroups of Asian American adolescents for whom family, school, and peer relationships exerted differential effects on suicide attempts. Data were drawn from Waves 1 and 2 of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health dataset and included responses from a national sample of 959 Asian American adolescents (48.0% girls; average age at Wave 2 = 16.43). A latent class regression was used to assess the optimal number of latent classes (i.e., subgroups of participants) that explained the associations between family, school, and peer relationships and subsequent suicide attempts. Three latent classes were identified. Most participants belonged to a latent class in which family, school, and peer relationships were protective factors. However, stronger school relationships and peer relationships were found to be risk factors in two other latent classes. The three latent classes also differed significantly in terms of suicide attempts, gender, and acculturation. The practical implications of this study, particularly for educators and mental health professionals, are discussed.

AB Suicide is now the second leading cause of death among persons between the ages of adolescents and emerging adults and rates have increased despite more funding and broader implementation of youth suicide-prevention programs. A systematic review was conducted focusing on identifying youth suicide-prevention studies within the United States. This paper reports on the methods utilized for understanding possible moderators of suicide-prevention program outcomes.
   We searched six databases from 1990 through August 2017 to identify studies of suicide-preventive interventions among those under age 26 years. Two independent team members screened search results and sequentially extracted information related to statistical methods of moderation analyses.
   69 articles were included in the systematic review of which only 17 (24.6%) explored treatment effect heterogeneity using moderation analysis. The most commonly used analytic tool was regression with an interaction term. The moderators studied included demographic characteristics such as gender and ethnicity as well as individual characteristics such as traumatic stress exposure and multiple prior suicide attempts.
   With a greater emphasis from the federal government and funding agencies on precision prevention, understanding which prevention programs work for specific subgroups is essential. Only a small percentage of the reviewed articles assessed moderation effects. This is a substantial research gap driven by sample size or other limitations which have impeded the identification of intervention effect heterogeneity.

AB Objective. - The aim of the research is to study whether any differences exist in the rates and characteristics of suicide by ethnicity and sex in South Tirol, Italy.
   Methods. - Psychological autopsy interviews were conducted for Suicides who died between March 1997 and July 2006.
   Results. - 332 individuals belonging to the three major South Tirolean ethnic groups (Germans, Italians, Ladins [Ladin is a Rhaeto-Romance language related to the Venetian and Swiss Romansh languages I) (lied by Suicide. Around 23% of the victims had experienced suicidal behaviour among family members, and more than 31% of them had experienced trauma during their childhood. Germans were 1.37 times more at risk to commit suicide than Italians (95% CI: 1.04/1.80 z = 2.26, p < .05). 69% Of the Suicides had attended school for less than 8 years: Germans (OR = 4.62; 95% CI: 2.52/8.47; p < .001) and Ladins (OR = 11.24; 95% CI: 2.99/42.30; p < .001) were more likely to have lower education than Italians. There were several differences by ethnicity and sex but no sex-by-ethnicity interactions.
   Conclusions. - The study indicated that suicide, an alarming health and social problem in south Tirol, may require different preventive interventions for men and women and for those of different ethnicities. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: Pregnant and postpartum women may be at increased risk of violent death including homicide and suicide relative to nonpregnant women, but US national data have not been reported since the implementation of enhanced mortality surveillance.
   OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to estimate homicide and suicide ratios among women who are pregnant or postpartum and to compare their risk of violent death with nonpregnant/nonpostpartum women.
   STUDY DESIGN: Death certificates (n = 465,097) from US states with enhanced pregnancy mortality surveillance from 2005 through 2010 were used to compare mortality among 4 groups of women aged 10-54 years: pregnant, early postpartum (pregnant within 42 days of death), late postpartum (pregnant within 43 days to 1 year of death), and nonpregnant/nonpostpartum. We estimated pregnancy-associated mortality ratios and compared with nonpregnant/nonpostpartum mortality ratios to identify differences in risk after adjusting for potential levels of pregnancy misclassification as reported in the literature.
   RESULTS: Pregnancy-associated homicide victims were most frequently young, black, and undereducated, whereas pregnancy-associated suicide occurred most frequently among older white women. After adjustments, pregnancy-associated homicide risk ranged from 2.2 to 6.2 per 100,000 live births, depending on the degree of misclassification estimated, compared with 2.5-2.6 per 100,000 nonpregnant/nonpostpartum women aged 10-54 years. Pregnancy-associated suicide risk ranged from 1.6-4.5 per 100,000 live births after adjustments compared with 5.3-5.5 per 100,000 women aged 10-54 years among nonpregnant/nonpostpartum women. Assuming the most conservative published estimate of misclassification, the risk of homicide among pregnant/postpartum women was 1.84 times that of nonpregnant/nonpostpartum women (95% confidence interval, 1.71-1.98), whereas risk of suicide was decreased (relative risk, 0.62, 95% confidence interval, 0.57-0.68).
   CONCLUSION: Pregnancy and postpartum appear to be times of increased risk for homicide and decreased risk for suicide among women in the United States.

AB Background. The US Army suicide rate has increased sharply in recent years. Identifying significant predictors of Army suicides in Army and Department of Defense (DoD) administrative records might help focus prevention efforts and guide intervention content. Previous studies of administrative data, although documenting significant predictors, were based on limited samples and models. A career history perspective is used here to develop more textured models.
   Method. The analysis was carried out as part of the Historical Administrative Data Study (HADS) of the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS). De-identified data were combined across numerous Army and DoD administrative data systems for all Regular Army soldiers on active duty in 2004-2009. Multivariate associations of sociodemographics and Army career variables with suicide were examined in subgroups defined by time in service, rank and deployment history.
   Results. Several novel results were found that could have intervention implications. The most notable of these were significantly elevated suicide rates (69.6-80.0 suicides per 100000 person-years compared with 18.5 suicides per 100000 person-years in the total Army) among enlisted soldiers deployed either during their first year of service or with less than expected (based on time in service) junior enlisted rank; a substantially greater rise in suicide among women than men during deployment; and a protective effect of marriage against suicide only during deployment.
   Conclusions. A career history approach produces several actionable insights missed in less textured analyses of administrative data predictors. Expansion of analyses to a richer set of predictors might help refine understanding of intervention implications.

AB Objective: To identify the substances used by people who die from suicide by overdose in Toronto and to determine the correlates of specific categories of substances used.
   Method: Coroner's records for all cases of suicide by overdose in Toronto, Ontario, during a 10-year period (1998 to 2007) were examined. Data collected included demographic data, all substances detected, and those determined by the coroner to have caused death. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine demographic and clinical factors associated with suicide by different drug types.
   Results: There were 397 documented suicides by overdose (mean age 49.1 years, 50% female). Most substances detected were psychotropic prescription medications (n = 245), followed by other prescription medications (n = :143) and over-the-counter (OTC) medications (n = 83). More than one-half of all suicides by overdose were determined to have only one specific substance as the cause of death (n = 206). In suicides where only one class of substance was present in lethal amounts, OTC medication (n = 48), opioid analgesics (n = 44), and tricyclic antidepressants (n = 44) were most common.
   Conclusions: Suicides by overdose involved the use of different classes of substances, including psychotropic prescription medication, other prescription medications, as well as OTC medications. Physicians and pharmacists should be aware of commonly used prescription and OTC medications in overdose and exercise increased vigilance in prescribing or dispensing them to at-risk patients.

AB Background. To explore the risk of suicide associated with occupation while evaluating the impact of socio-economic, demographic and psychiatric differences.
   Method. A nested case-control study with 3195 suicides and 63 900 matched controls. Information on causes of death, occupation, psychiatric admission, marital status and socio-economic factors was obtained from routine registers.
   Results. Across the 55 occupations investigated, the risk of suicide ranged from 2.73 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.77-4.22] among doctors to 0.44 (95 % CI 0.27-0.72) among architects and engineers compared with primary school teachers. With the exception of doctors and nurses, most of the excess risk of suicide associated with particular occupations is explained by the social and economic characteristics of people in those occupations. Much, but not all, of the excess risk in doctors and nurses is due to their increased use of self-poisoning, a method for which they have the knowledge to use effectively. Occupation has little association with suicide among people who suffer from a psychiatric illness, except for doctors, where the excess risk is 3.62 (p = 0.007).
   Conclusions. Most of the considerable variation in suicide risk across occupations is explained by socio-economic factors, except for doctors and nurses. Apart from in doctors, the risk of suicide has little association with occupation among people who suffer from a psychiatric illness. Restriction of access to lethal means is an important strategy in suicide prevention.

AB Background: External causes of injury codes (E-codes) are used in administrative and claims databases for billing and often employed to estimate the number of self-injury visits to emergency departments (EDs). Aims: This study assessed the accuracy of E-codes using standardized, independently administered research assessments at the time of ED visits. Method: We recruited 254 patients at three psychiatric emergency departments in the United States between 2007 and 2011, who completed research assessments after presenting for suicide-related concerns and were classified as suicide attempters (50.4%, n = 128), nonsuicidal self-injurers (11.8%, n = 30), psychiatric controls (29.9%, n = 76), or interrupted suicide attempters (7.8%, n = 20). These classifications were compared with their E-code classifications. Results: Of the participants, 21.7% (55/254) received an E-code. In all, 36.7% of research-classified suicide attempters and 26.7% of research-classified nonsuicidal self-injurers received self-inflicted injury E-codes. Those who did not receive an E-code but should have based on the research assessments had more severe psychopathology, more Axis I diagnoses, more suicide attempts, and greater suicidal ideation. Limitations: The sample came from three large academic medical centers and these findings may not be generalizable to all EDs. Conclusion: The frequency of ED visits for self-inflicted injury is much greater than current figures indicate and should be increased threefold.

   UTILITY WORKERS; MORTALITY; RISK; IMPACT; PATTERNS; HEALTH
AB Background
   Previous research has shown that those employed in certain occupations, such as doctors and farmers, have an elevated risk of suicide, yet little research has sought to synthesise these findings across working-age populations.
   Aims
   To summarise published research in this area through systematic review and meta-analysis.
   Method
   Random effects meta-analyses were used to calculate a pooled risk of suicide across occupational skill-level groups.
   Results
   Thirty-four studies were included in the meta-analysis. Elementary professions (e.g. labourers and cleaners) were at elevated risk compared with the working-age population (rate ratio (RR)= 1.84, 95% Cl 1.46-2.33), followed by machine operators and deck crew (RR= 1.78, 95% Cl 1.22-2.60) and agricultural workers (RR= 1.64, 95% Cl 1.19-2.28). Results suggested a stepwise gradient in risk, with the lowest skilled occupations being at greater risk of suicide than the highest skill-level group.
   Conclusions
   This is the first comprehensive meta-analytical review of suicide and occupation. There is a need for future studies to investigate explanations for the observed skill-level differences, particularly in people employed in lower skill-level groups.

AB Although personal assistance services would appear to have no direct connection to the national debate over legalization of physician-assisted suicide, arguments relating to personal assistance have been raised in the debate. Independent living opponents of a right to assisted suicide contend that people with disabilities who do not have access to the basic personal assistance services they need are inherently oppressed, and a society that provides a right to assisted suicide is essentially an accomplice in coercing such individuals to end their lives, Independent living proponents of the right argue that people with disabilities should have control over the assistance they need to achieve all their goals, and access to desired assistance in seeking death may allow some to decide to forgo or postpone what would otherwise be a desperate act. Both sides would agree that personal assistance services are extremely important to people with disabilities, and that universal access to such services will eliminate a major area of contention in the right-to-die debate in the United States.

AB After regulatory agencies in the United Kingdom and United States recommended severe restrictions on antidepressant use in children, many lessons were learned, although one was not that these drugs cause suicide. We learned that pharmaceutical companies selectively released data that reflected positively on their products and that combining suppressed and published data suggested that most of these medications had questionable efficacy. We also learned that the studies lacked uniformity both in which age groups constituted children and which behavior was considered suicidal. Several recent, large nonindustry studies indicated that rates of suicide and suicidal behavior were actually reduced in children who used antidepressants, despite piteous anecdotal tales in the popular press purporting that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) caused children to kill themselves. Patients in pharmaceutical trials probably do not represent typical patients in routine clinical practice. Emerging implications are that suicidal behavior-if it does occur-is most likely soon after starting antidepressant use and that prescribers must be both vigilant in educating patients and families about warning signs and available to manage worrisome behavior.

AB Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorders in the United States and has been linked to suicidal thoughts and behaviors, yet the role of a PTSD diagnosis on functional impairment among suicidal individuals remains unknown. This study examined the association between PTSD status and functional impairment among military psychiatric inpatients admitted for acute suicide risk (N = 166) with a lifetime history of at least one suicide attempt. Measures of functionality included: (1) alcohol use; (2) sleep quality; (3) social problem-solving; and (4) work and social adjustment. Thirty-eight percent of the sample met criteria for PTSD. Women were more likely than men to meet criteria for PTSD (p = 0.007), and participants who met PTSD criteria had significantly more psychiatric diagnoses (p < 0.001). Service members who met PTSD criteria reported more disturbed sleep (p = 0.003) and greater difficulties with work and social adjustment (p = 0.004) than those who did not meet PTSD criteria. However, functionality measures were not significantly associated with PTSD status after controlling for gender and psychiatric comorbidity. Gender and number of psychiatric comorbidities other than PTSD were significant predictors of PTSD in logistic regression models across four functionality measures. Future studies should assess the additive or mediating effect of psychiatric comorbidities in the association between impaired functioning and PTSD. Clinicians are encouraged to assess and address functionality during treatment with suicidal individuals, paying particular attention to individuals with multiple psychiatric diagnoses.

AB In an age of rapid advances in life-prolonging treatment, patients and caregivers are increasingly facing tensions in making end-of-life decisions. An examination of the history of health care in the United States reveals technological, economic, and medical factors that have contributed to the problems of terminal care and consequently to the movement of assisted suicide. The movement has its roots in at least two fundamental perceptions and expectations. In the age of technological medicine energized by the profit motive, dying comes at a high price in suffering and in personal economic loss. The failure to provide affordable resources for terminal care is the result of the marketplace in health care. The medical profession has been painfully slow in responding to the challenges of terminal care, mainly because of the pressures of the marketplace and lack of adequate training. This has occurred at a time of rapid advances in life-sustaining treatment and of expanding public awareness of personal rights under the law. Overly aggressive treatment in the final stages of terminal illness has enhanced anxieties over a painfully prolonged and expensive dying. These factors have promoted the movement to assisted suicide. In the U.S. debate of the issues, ethicists tend to argue abstractly without examining adequately the context of terminal care that is the health care system. It is a system in dire need of a reform that will remove it from the marketplace.

ID ADOLESCENT COMPLETED SUICIDE; MAJOR AFFECTIVE-DISORDER; DEPRESSION;
   BEHAVIOR; IDEATION; BIPOLAR; CHILD
AB Alcoholism is associated with a high risk for suicidal behavior. Up to 40% of persons with alcoholism attempt suicide at some time and 7% end their lives by committing suicide. Risk factors include being male, older than 50 years of age, living alone, being unemployed, poor social support, interpersonal losses, continued drinking, consumption of a greater amount of alcohol when drinking, a recent alcohol binge, previous alcohol treatment, a family history of alcoholism, a history of comorbid substance abuse (especially cocaine), a major depressive episode, serious medical illness, suicidal communication, and prior suicidal behavior. Suicidal behavior is especially frequent in patients with comorbid alcoholism and major depression. However, all patients with alcoholism should be evaluated for suicide risk. Understanding of risk and vulnerability to suicidal behavior in alcoholism still outweighs our knowledge of protective factors and resilience. Knowledge of protective factors for suicide may help to prevent and/or predict suicidal behavior. Protective factors for suicide in alcoholism are quite varied and include an individual's biological and behavioral characteristics, as well as attributes of the environment and culture. Protective factors include effective clinical care for psychiatric (including alcoholism and drug abuse) and physical disorders, easy access to a variety of clinical interventions and support for seeking help, restricted access to highly lethal means of suicide, strong connections to family and community support, skills in problem solving and conflict resolution, cultural and religious beliefs that discourage suicide and support self-preservation. Future studies are necessary to determine which interventions may reduce suicidal behavior in alcoholism.

AB Responding to an unprecedented increase in the suicide rate among soldiers, in 2008 the US Army and US National Institute of Mental Health funded the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS), a multicomponent epidemiological and neurobiological study of risk and resilience factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and their psychopathological correlates among Army personnel. Using a combination of administrative records, representative surveys, computerized neurocognitive tests, and blood samples, Army STARRS and its longitudinal follow-up study (STARRS-LS) are designed to identify potentially actionable findings to inform the Army's suicide prevention efforts. The current report presents a broad overview of Army STARRS and its findings to date on suicide deaths, attempts, and ideation, as well as other important outcomes that may increase suicide risk (e.g., mental disorders, sexual assault victimization). The findings highlight the complexity of environmental and genetic risk and protective factors in different settings and contexts, and the importance of life and career history in understanding suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

AB Background: Understanding reasons for prescription opioid misuse can help elucidate suicide prevention efforts. The goal of the current study is to assess associations of reasons for prescription opioid misuse subtypes and suicide-related variables. We also assessed whether prescription opioid misuse differentiates ideators from those who attempt suicide.
   Methods: Using data from the 2015-2017 National Survey of Drug Use and Health (N = 45,074), prescription opioid misuse subtypes were grouped as follows: (a) Pain only, (b) Other reasons, and (c) Mixed reasons (i.e., pain and at least one other reason). Logistic regressions examined associations of misuse subtypes and past 12-month suicide-related variables (ideation, planning, attempts) relative to non-misusers. Logistic regression analyses were also conducted among the subset reporting ideation to assess whether prescription opioid misuse differentiated ideators with no attempt from ideators with an attempt.
   Results: In adjusted models, the Pain only and the Other reasons subtypes were associated with ideation and planning, but not attempts. The Mixed reasons subtype had higher odds of suicide ideation and planning compared to those not misusing prescription opioids and the Pain only misuse subtype. The Mixed reasons subtype had higher odds of a suicide attempt only when compared to those not misusing prescription opioids. Prescription opioid misuse was also associated with suicide attempts among the subset of ideators.
   Conclusions: Findings indicate that people misuse prescription opioids for various reasons, and misuse subtypes are associated with past 12-month suicidality. Addressing pain and other reasons for misuse together through use of evidence-based treatments may help mitigate suicide risk.

DE Sleep Disorders; Suicide
ID SLEEP PROBLEMS; TIME; MILITARY; INSOMNIA; BEHAVIOR; ADULTS; PHASE
AB Objective: Suicide is a major public health problem and the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. The identification of modifiable risk factors is essential for reducing the prevalence of suicide. Recently, it has been shown that insomnia and nightmares significantly increase the risk for suicidal ideation, attempted suicide, and death by suicide. While both forms of sleep disturbance may independently confer risk, and potentially be modifiable risk factors, it is also possible that simply being awake at night represents a specific vulnerability for suicide. The present analysis evaluates the frequency of completed suicide per hour while taking into account the percentage of individuals awake at each hour.
   Methods: Archival analyses were conducted estimating the time of fatal injury using the National Violent Death Reporting System for 2003-2010 and the proportion of the American population awake per hour across the 24-hour day using the American Time Use Survey.
   Results: The mean +/- SD incident rate from 06:00-23:59 was 2.2% +/- 0.7%, while the mean +/- SD incident rate from 00:00-05:59 was 10.3% +/- 4.9%. The maximum incident rate was from 02:00-02:59 (16.3%). Hour-by-hour observed values differed from those that would be expected by chance (P < .001), and when 6-hour blocks were examined, the observed frequency at night was 3.6 times higher than would be expected by chance (P < .001).
   Conclusions: Being awake at night confers greater risk for suicide than being awake at other times of the day, suggesting that disturbances of sleep or circadian neurobiology may potentiate suicide risk. (C) Copyright 2016 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB Objective. The objectives of this study are to examine racial and ethnic differences in suicidal behaviour, its main risk factors, and the effect of the risk factors on suicidal behaviour in young adults in the United States.
   Design. Using nationally representative data (n = 10,585) from Add Health, we calculate the prevalence of suicidal behavior and associated risk factors for non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic youth (aged 18-26) using logistic regression models of suicidal ideation stratified by race.
   Results. Non-Hispanic White and Hispanic young adults have higher rates of suicidal ideation than their non-Hispanic Black counterparts, but racial/ethnic differences in attempts are not statistically significant. Non-Hispanic Whites and Hispanic young adults are more likely to possess key risk factors for suicide. With the exception of substance use variables (i.e. alcohol and marijuana use) which appear to be more conducive to suicidal ideation in non-Hispanic Black than in non-Hispanic White young adults, the effects of risk factors appear to be similar across race/ethnicity.
   Conclusion. The higher prevalence of suicidal ideation in non-Hispanic White and Hispanic young adults may be driven by their greater exposure to risk factors, as opposed to differences in the effects of these risk factors. More research is needed to uncover why non-Hispanic White and Hispanic young adults have higher rates of suicidal ideation than their non-Hispanic Black counterparts; yet, rates of suicide attempts are comparable and non-Hispanic White young adults have the highest rate of completed suicides.

AB Entrapment is an emerging theoretical and empirical factor associated with suicide. The current study expanded our understanding of entrapment by examining the Entrapment Scale factor structure, demographic correlates, and association with suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs). Data from an online cross-national study of suicide were analyzed from two samples of young adults aged 18-34 (United Kingdom [U.K.] sample N = 418; United States [U.S.] N = 414). Primary findings included: (1) factor-analytic support for a two factor (i.e., internal and external) Entrapment Scale structure; (2) variation in external entrapment subscale factor loadings by sample; (3) significant demographic correlates of elevated entrapment of younger age, female gender, and U.S. sample; (4) significant convergent positive associations for both entrapment types with cognitive (e.g., perceived burdensomeness), mental health (e.g., anxiety), and STB correlates; and (5) significant, robust associations of internal entrapment and perceived burdensomeness with STBs in the U.K. sample. Implications are reviewed for suicide prevention theory, research and practice.

TI Firearm Anticipatory Guidance Training in Psychiatric Residency Programs
SO ACADEMIC PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID ENCOUNTERING PATIENT SUICIDE; STATES; RATES; HOME
AB Objective: Most suicides (60%) are committed with firearms, and most (80%) of individuals attempting suicide meet diagnostic criteria for mental illness. This study assessed the prevalence of firearm injury prevention training in psychiatric residency programs.
   Methods: A three-wave mail survey was sent to the directors of 179 psychiatric residency programs. Outcome measures were the portion of programs offering training in anticipatory guidance for firearms safety, the content of training if offered, and the perceived benefits and barriers to providing such training.
   Results: A total of 115 directors responded, a response rate of 64%. The vast majority (79%) reported they had not seriously thought about providing firearm injury prevention training. However, more than half (55%) reported that they routinely screened patients for firearm ownership. The directors perceived more benefits than barriers to offering such training. Additionally, the majority (62%) thought APA should provide curriculum guidelines regarding firearm injury prevention training.
   Conclusion: Psychiatrists are uniquely positioned for helping to prevent firearm suicides and homicides among the mentally ill. However, psychiatric residency programs are inadequately training residents and thereby keeping them from maximizing their roles as mental health professionals. Leadership is needed by APA to help reduce firearm violence in the United States.

AB Background: Suicide is the second leading cause of death among US adolescents aged 12-19 years. Researchers would benefit from a better understanding of the direct effects of bullying and e-bullying on adolescent suicide to inform intervention work. Aims: To explore the direct and indirect effects of bullying and e-bullying on adolescent suicide attempts (SAs) and to estimate the magnitude of these effects controlling for significant covariates. Method: This study uses data from the 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey (YRBS), a nationally representative sample of US high school youth. We quantified the association between bullying and the likelihood of SA, after adjusting for covariates (i.e., sexual orientation, obesity, sleep, etc) identified with the PC algorithm. Results: Bullying and e- bullying were significantly associated with SA in logistic regression analyses. Bullying had an estimated average causal effect (ACE) of 2.46%, while e-bullying had an ACE of 4.16%. Limitations: Data are cross-sectional and temporal precedence is not known. Conclusion: These findings highlight the strong association between bullying, e-bullying, and SA.

AB Purpose of Review To examine current trends in suicide and self-injury in the USA, as well as potential contributors to their change over time, and to reflect on innovations in prevention and intervention that can guide policies and programs to reduce the burden of suicide and self-injury in the USA. Recent Findings Suicide and non-fatal self-injury are on the rise in the USA. Reasons for such trends over time remain speculative, although they seem linked to coincident increases in mood disorders and drug use and overdose. Promising innovative prevention and intervention programs that engage new technologies, such as machine learning-derived prediction tools and computerized ecologic momentary assessments, are currently in development and require additional evidence. Recent increases in fatal and non-fatal self-harm in the USA raise questions about the causes, interventions, and preventive measures that should be taken. Most innovative prevention efforts target individuals seeking to improve risk prediction and access to evidence-based care. However, as Durkheim pointed out over 100 years ago, suicide rates vary enormously between societal groups, suggesting that certain causal factors of suicide act and, hence, should be targeted at an ecological level. In the next generation of suicide research, it is critical to examine factors beyond the proximal and clinical to allow for a reimagining of prevention that is life course and socially focused.

AB This study examined demographic and psychosocial correlates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in women with histories of sexual assault in childhood and/or adulthood identified from a national sample of women. Multivariate analyses showed that women with histories of sexual assault in both childhood and adulthood reported significantly greater odds of lifetime suicide attempts, controlling for demographic factors and other psychosocial characteristics. As predicted, younger age (marginal), stressful life events (marginal), depression, PTSD, and alcohol dependence symptoms were also significantly associated with suicidal ideation. Furthermore, number of lifetime traumatic events and depression were each associated with lifetime odds of suicide attempts. Implications for studying the role of sexual trauma and other psychosocial factors in relation to women's suicidal behavior are discussed.

AB Pedestrian suicide bombers (SB) pose an infectious threat to United States (U.S.) forces. The objective of this study is to evaluate the use of rapid human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody assays under contaminated field conditions and develop plans to mitigate the infectious threat. Twenty-six commercially available rapid HIV antibody assays were contaminated with environmental substances. Half of the tests were conducted with HIV-1 antibody (Ab) positive controls and half with HIV Ab negative controls. There were no test failures. Using statistical approximations to evaluate the plausibility of a zero failure rate, the upper 95% confidence limit for the occurrence of a test failure by chance is at most 10.8%. These results suggest the test's success is less likely because of chance and further studies should be conducted for validation. Regardless of the methodology, it is important to develop plans to mitigate infectious risks from pedestrian suicide bombers.

AB Background: Visits to emergency departments (EDs) for suicidal ideation or a suicide attempt have increased in the past decades. Yet comprehensive models of suicide are scarce, potentially enhancing misunderstandings from health professionals. This study aimed to investigate the applicability of the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide (IPTS) in a population visiting EDs for suicide-related issues.
   Methods: Three major hypotheses formulated by the IPTS were tested in a sample of 167 individuals visiting EDs for suicidal ideation or a suicide attempt.
   Results: As predicted by the IPTS, greater levels of perceived burdensomeness (PB) were associated with presence of current suicidal ideation. However, contrary to the theory assumptions, thwarted belongingness (TB) was not predictive of current suicidal ideation (Hypothesis 1). Similarly, the interaction between PB, TB and hopelessness did not account for the transition from passive to active suicidal ideation (Hypothesis 2). The interaction between active suicidal ideation and fearlessness of death did not either predict the transition from active suicidal ideation to suicidal intent (Hypothesis 3).
   Limitations:.The cross-sectional design limited the interpretation of causal hypotheses. Patients visiting EDs during nights and weekends were underrepresented. A general measure of hopelessness was considered, not a measure of hopelessness specifically related to PB and TB.
   Conclusions: Although the three hypotheses were only partially verified, health professionals might consider the IPTS as useful for the management of patient with suicide-related issues. Clinical intervention based on perceived burdensomeness could notably be proposed shortly after ED admission.

AB Objective: The authors analyzed suicide across the life cycle of different ethnic groups in an urban population equally divided between blacks (44.6%) and whites (48.1%).
   Method: Two data sets were used: 1) all suicides in Fulton County, Ga., from January 1994 through December 2002 and 2) all U. S. suicides reported by the National Center for Injury Prevention in 1999 and 2000.
   Results: The population rates for suicide in Fulton County were 1.22 per 100,000 black females, 10.74 per 100,000 black males, 9.89 per 100,000 white females, and 21.04 per 100,000 white males. In Fulton County, age at completed suicide was more than a decade lower in blacks than in whites. The median age of black victims was 32 years, with an interquartile range (IQR) of 23 - 45, and the median for whites was 44 years ( IQR = 31 - 58); the difference was significant. The mean ages of victims who were black ( mean = 36.1 years, SD = 17.0) and of "other" race ( mean = 35.7, SD = 14.3) were significantly lower than the mean for whites ( mean= 46.2, SD= 18.5). The national data were similar, but minorities accounted for an even smaller percentage of suicides. Median age at completed suicide for African Americans nationally was 34 years ( IQR= 24 - 45) compared to 44 years ( IQR= 32 - 58) for Caucasians.
   Conclusions: African Americans commit suicide at rates much lower than those for whites, but they do so when much younger and they have a narrow, age-defined window of vulnerability. Age-specific psychopathological processes and protective factors may define suicide risk for each demographic group.

AB Suicide is a major public health problem, claiming the lives of more than 40.000 individuals in the United States each year. Efforts are needed to (a) identify those at heightened risk for suicide, utilizing objective assessment methods and (b) determine factors that may be protective against engaging in suicidal behavior, even in the context of the desire to do so. Scales RCd (demoralization) and RC9 (hypomanic activation) of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI)-2 Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF) may be valuable in this regard. Whereas individuals high on both RCd and RC9 are dysphoric and prone to reckless action, individuals high on RCd but low on RC9 are characterized by levels of high lethargy and physical unexcitability that may be protective against making a suicide attempt. The purpose of this study was to determine whether scales RCd and RC9 of the MMPI-2-RF interact to predict suicide attempts among suicide ideators. Participants were 189 psychiatric outpatients between the ages of 18 and 65 years (M = 28.8, SD = 11.8: 68.8% female, 74.5% non-Hispanic White) who reported nonzero levels of suicidal ideation on the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation. Overall, 46.6% of patients reported a past suicide attempt. Consistent with hypotheses, RCd and RC9 interacted such that elevations on RCd were positively associated with past suicide attempts at high, but not low, levels of RC9. Alternate models demonstrated that this configuration persisted when examining the ACT Specific Problem scale as a surrogate for RC9. This study presents a novel MMPI-2-RF configuration that may enhance the assessment of suicide risk.

ID TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS; HEAVY DRINKING; UNITED-STATES; CONSUMPTION;
   MORTALITY; HOMICIDE; REGIONS; RATES
AB Background: The high suicide rate in Russia and its profound fluctuation over the past decades have attracted considerable interest. There is growing evidence that beverage preference and binge-drinking patterns, i.e., excessive consumption of strong spirits, results in a quicker and deeper level of intoxication, which increases the propensity for the alcohol-related suicide. In line with this evidence, we assumed that higher levels of vodka consumption, in conjunction with binge-drinking patterns, would result in a close, aggregate-level association between vodka sales and suicide in Russia. Aims and Methods: To test this hypothesis, trends in beverage-specific alcohol sales per capita and suicide rates from 1970 to 2005 in Russia were analyzed employing ARIMA time-series analysis. Results: The results of the time-series analysis suggested that a 1 liter increase in overall alcohol sales would result in a 4% increase in the male suicide rate and a 2.8% increase in the female suicide rate; a 1 liter increase in vodka sales would increase the suicide rate by 9.3% for men and by 6% for women. Conclusions: This study replicates previous findings from other settings, which suggest that suicide rates tend to be more responsive to changes in distilled spirits consumption per capita than to the total level of alcohol consumption. Assuming that drinking spirits is usually associated with intoxication episodes, these findings provide additional evidence that the drinking pattern is an important determinant in the relationship between alcohol and suicide. The outcomes of this study also provide support for the hypothesis that suicide and alcohol are closely connected in cultures where an intoxication-oriented drinking pattern prevails and adds to the growing body of evidence that alcohol plays a crucial role in the fluctuation in suicide mortality rates in Russia during recent decades.

TI Examination of the Effectiveness of the Mental Health Environment of
   Care Checklist in Reducing Suicide on Inpatient Mental Health Units
SO ARCHIVES OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID PREVENTION; REGRESSION
AB Context: Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in the United States. While suicides occurring during psychiatric hospitalization represent a very small proportion of the total number of suicides, these events are highly preventable owing to the controlled nature of the environment. Many methods have been proposed, but no interventions have been tested.
   Objective: To evaluate the effect of identification and abatement of hazards on inpatient suicides in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).
   Design, Setting, and Patients: The effect of implementation of a checklist (the Mental Health Environment of Care Checklist) and abatement process designed to remove suicide hazards from inpatient mental health units in all VHA hospitals was examined by measuring change in the rate of suicides before and after the intervention.
   Intervention: Implementation of the Mental Health Environment of Care Checklist.
   Main Outcome Measure: The number of completed suicides on inpatient mental health units in VHA hospitals.
   Results: Implementation of the Mental Health Environment of Care Checklist was associated with a reduction in the rate of completed inpatient suicide in VHA hospitals nationally. This reduction remained present when controlling for number of admissions (2.64 per 100 000 admissions before to 0.87 per 100 000 admissions after implementation; P < .001) and bed days of care (2.08 per 1 million bed days before to 0.79 per 1 million bed days after implementation; P < .001).
   Conclusions: Use of the Mental Health Environment of Care Checklist was associated with a substantial reduction in the inpatient suicide rate occurring on VHA mental health units. Use of the checklist in non-VHA hospitals may be warranted.

AB Increasing attention is being paid to suicide among law enforcement officers, and how the agencies that employ these officers could prevent such deaths. This study presents the results of a national survey of U.S. law enforcement agencies' strategies for preventing officer suicide. We invited 177 agencies from across the United States to be interviewed, and 110 agreed to participate in qualitative interviews. Agencies were grouped into one of four categories based on the services they offered. Agencies offered minimal (a municipal employee assistance program), basic (mental health, critical incident response procedures, and training), proactive (in-house mental health care, embedded chaplains, substance misuse programs, peer support, screening, or health and wellness programs), and integrated services (integration of services into day-to-day operations). The results indicate that many U.S. law enforcement agencies are engaged in efforts to promote officer wellness and prevent suicide. Officers' perceptions of confidentiality may inhibit the use of in-house or contracted mental health services, while a weak or inconclusive evidence-base raises questions about common approaches like peer support or critical incident stress debriefing.

AB Since Durkheim's classic work on suicide, sociological attention to understanding the roots of self-destruction has been inconsistent. hi this review, we use three historical periods of interest (pre-Durkheim, Durkheim, post-Durkheim) to organize basic findings in the body of sociological knowledge regarding suicide. Much of the twentieth-century research focused on issues of integration and regulation, imitation, and the social construction of suicide rates. Innovations in the twenty-first-century resurgence of sociological research on suicide are described in detail. These newer studies begin to redirect theory and analysis toward a focus on ethnoracial subgroups, individual-level phenomena (e.g., ideation), and age-period-cohort effects. Our analysis of sociology's contributions, limits, and possibilities leads to a recognition of the need to break through bifurcations in individual- and aggregate-level studies, to pursue the translation of Durkheim's original theory into a network perspective as one avenue of guiding micro-macro research, and to attend to the complexity in both multidisciplinary explanations and pragmatic interventions.

Variables that contribute to this relationship are examined, including geographic location, legislative issues, impulsivity, and occupation. Reasons for considering this correlation as a social advocacy issue for psychologists are presented, and recommendations for the profession of psychology are described. These recommendations include potential empirical research areas, ways of incorporating the relationship between firearm availability and suicidal risk into doctoral training programs, and a variety of practice-related recommendations.

AB The incidence rate of suicidal ideation among current and former smokers versus never smokers is not known. In this study, the age-adjusted incidence of suicidal ideation was highest among current smokers, followed by former, then never smokers. The adjusted hazard for suicide ideation was 2.22 (95%CI = 1.48, 3.33) and 1.19 (95%CI = 0.78, 1.82) for current and former smokers, respectively, compared to never smokers. Results indicate that current smokers have increased risks of suicidal ideation above and beyond the risk for never and former smokers regardless of age, gender, history of depressive disorder or anxiety symptoms, and alcohol abuse/dependence. Smoking cessation might be beneficial for some suicide prevention efforts.

AB Nearly 3 out of 4 all lifelong mental disorders occur by the age of twenty-four. Remote crisis support holds great potential in filling a critical gap in complementing and expanding access to mental health services for acute episodes of mental distress in adolescents and young adults; yet little is understood about the individual factors that influence help seeking behavior in this group. Recent evidence suggests technology-based mental health services have high acceptability among youth and may be used to treat anxiety and depression. The objective of this study was to examine county-level help-seeking behavior among adolescents and young adults using Crisis Text Line (CTL). CTL is a free, text based crisis counseling service that has been available nationally since 2013. Spatial error regression was used to (1) identify the individual-level factors that correlate with help-seeking behavior for depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts and (2) to explore the geographic trends in text-based help-seeking behavior between adolescents and young adults across the rural-urban continuum. Increased rates of text-based help-seeking occurred in counties with higher mean household incomes, higher divorce rates, and lower residential stability. Rurality was the strongest predictor for low rates of help-seeking, and this finding is particularly concerning in light of elevated rates of suicide among rural counties. Rural communities, particularly those with low support-seeking behavior and comparatively high suicide rates, should be the target of future research and outreach.

AB Traditional masculinity is hypothesized to be associated with suicidal ideation, and traditional masculinity is predicted to interact with stressors, intensifying suicidal ideation. Cross-sectional and prospective data from a study of 2,431 young adults was analyzed using hierarchical regression main effects and interaction models. Traditional masculinity was associated with suicidal ideation, second only in strength to depression, including when controlling for other risk factors. Prospective effects were substantially weaker. There was mixed evidence for traditional masculinity by stress interactions. The results provide preliminary support for the role of traditional masculinity in suicidal ideation, but the relationship should be tested in studies of suicide attempts and mortality. Implications for prevention and intervention are explored.

ID INJURIES; SUICIDE; RIFLES; HEAD
AB Air guns and blank guns may appear relatively harmless at first glance, but they are, in fact, potentially destructive, even lethal, weapons. Approximately 2 to 2.5 million nonpowder firearms are sold annually, and again approximately 12.9 per 100,000 population are treated for such injuries in hospital emergency departments each year in the United. States. Unfortunately, these guns are considered to be a toy for children. Therefore, incidents of air gun injuries are gradually increasing. Although such injuries may initially be considered trivial, it may signify severe internal tissue pathologies. These apparently trivial injuries may have catastrophic consequences if unnoticed.
   In this study, we report 4 cases with head injury due to a shot by these guns. The cases indicate that these people had used the guns belonging to their parents for the purpose of suicide. The cases also show that these machines are not innocent.

AB Background: Suicide is known to be the leading cause of death among police officers (PO) worldwide. However, most studies were conducted in developed countries, with no data from Brazil. The present study aimed to evaluate the incidence and the sociodemographic profile of suicide among a military PO subpopulation in South Brazil.
   Methods: This retrospective cohort evaluated 31,110 military PO with available data on cause of death from 2006 to 2016. Participants were monitored for an average of 18.8 +/- 9.6 years following the date of entry into the military police.
   Results: Mean age at the end of the follow up time was 41.4 +/- 9.1 years, with 90.7% males. A total of 650 participants died (2.1%), with 43 suicides (6.6% of all deaths) - cumulative incidence of 138/100,000. Bivariate analysis revealed a significant association (p < 0.05) between suicide and age (HR = 0.70, 95%Cl = 0.66-0.74), females (HR = 1.67, 95%Cl = 1.08-2.60) and enlisted military rank (HR = 14.9, 95%Cl = 2.05-108.5). Multivariate models showed an independent association between suicide and age (HR = 0.71, 95%Cl = 0.67-0.74) and enlisted military rank (HR = 9.96, 95%Cl = 130-763).
   Conclusions: The incidence of suicide among military PO in South Brazil was high, compared to the national suicide rate. Younger age and lower military rank were independent predictors of suicide in this subpopulation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB There has been no worldwide ecological study on suicide as a global major public health problem. This study aimed to identify the variations in suicide specific rates using the Human Development Index (HDI) and some health related variables among countries around the world. In this ecological study, we obtained the data from the World Bank Report 2013. The analysis was restricted to 91 countries for which both the epidemiologic data from the suicide rates and HDI were available. Overall, the global prevalence of suicide rate was 10.5 (95% confidence intervals: 8.8, 12.2) per 100,000 individuals, which significantly varied according to gender (16.3 in males vs. 4.6 in females, p < 0.001) and different levels of human development (11.64/100,000 individuals in very high development countries, 7.93/100,000 individuals in medium development countries, and 13.94/100,000 individuals in high development countries, p = 0.004). In conclusion, the suicide rate varies greatly between countries with different development levels. Our findings also suggest that male gender and HDI components are associated with an increased risk of suicide behaviors. Hence, detecting population subgroups with a high suicide risk and reducing the inequality of socioeconomic determinants are necessary to prevent this disorder around the world.

AB Suicide rates among Indian youth in the United States are two to three times the national average. Although researchers have identified related risk and protective factors, they have limited understanding of the perspectives of youth at risk. In this descriptive, ethnographic study in a Pacific Northwest tribe, the goal was to gain an understanding of the life experiences of the youth. Focus groups and observations were conducted with 30 Indian youth aged between 14 and 19 years in a Pacific Northwest tribe. Youth were asked to talk about their stressors, sense of family/community support, and hopes for the future. Youth reported major stress and noted that friends and family were both a support and also a source of stress. They hoped for strengthening of cultural values, economic development, and opportunities to give their talents to the tribe. These findings provide further insight about suicide risk among Indian youth and advance the understanding of suicide prevention in a transcultural setting.

AB Background: Use of alcohol and select other drugs confer risk for injury deaths, yet how such use compares in different types of injury deaths including suicide and fatal motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) is unclear.
   Methods: Individuals in New Mexico ages 18 to 54 that died in 2012 by suicide or MVC were analyzed. Toxicology results were used to code the presence of alcohol and the presence of 1 or more drugs including cocaine, opiate (oxycodone, heroin, etc.), or amphetamine or methamphetamine, yielding a 4-category variable: Alcohol+Drug, Alcohol (without drug), Drug (without alcohol), and Neither (ref). Suicides were compared to MVCs (ref) using unconditional logistic regression analyses adjusted for sex, age, and ethnicity. Poisoning suicides were removed prior to analyses to exclude cases where the drugs may have been used to hasten death.
   Results: Analyses were based on 185 suicides and 161 MVCs. Alcohol+Drug was more likely in suicide decedents, AOR (95% CI)=4.33 (1.70, 11.03). Alcohol (without drug) and Drug (without alcohol) did not differ between the groups. Uniquely, all suicides that were positive for cocaine were also positive for alcohol. As follow-up, similar results were obtained in a post hoc analysis that limited the drug exposure variable to cocaine: Alcohol+Cocaine, AOR (95% CI)=4.69 (1.59, 13.88).
   Conclusions: The co-presence of alcohol and 1 or more drugs of abuse, particularly cocaine, may be more likely in suicide deaths compared to MVCs. Results may inform prevention efforts targeting specific substances and types of injury.

AB Durkheim's (1897/1951) theory of political integration argues that when political crises occur, individuals band together to solve the problem at hand. As a result, this increased integration yields lower suicide rates. The purpose of this analysis is to examine a different component of the concept of political integration-that of attitudes. During the past couple of decades, individuals in eight Western European countries have been asked about their attitudes toward the unification of Western Europe. Cross-sectional time series analysis reveals that the attitudes individuals hold toward such an event are significantly related to suicide rates. Although Durkheim's theory of political integration focuses on events within a given country, the research herein finds that political integration exists on an international level as well. A reformulation of Durkheim's theory of political integration is put forth.

AB BACKGROUND: Panic disorder is a common and severe psychiatric disorder. The estimated current prevalence rate for panic disorder is 1% to 2% of the adult population. Panic disorder is commonly accompanied by major depression, substance use disorders, and other anxiety disorders. Female gender, low socioeconomic status, and anxious childhood temperament are common risk factors for panic disorder. Panic disorder can produce marked distress and impairment and is associated with significant suicide risk. Panic disorder appears to increase risk for all-cause mortality because it may increase risk for cardiovascular disease.

AB Around the world girls and women have higher rates of suicidal ideation and behavior but lower rates of suicide than boys and men. There is, however, significant variability in gender patterns and meanings suicidal behavior within and across cultures. For example, in the United States, suicide is most common among older "White" men. and is typically considered masculine behavior. Women who kill themselves are viewed as acting like men, and therefore deviant. By contrast, in other societies, including China, suicide is viewed as an act of the powerless, and is most frequent in young women. In these societies, men who kill themselves are considered weak and effeminate. The cultural diversity in gender patterns and interpretations of suicidal behavior challenges essentialist perspectives on gender and suicidal behavior. It also challenges the assumption, common in industrialized countries, that women are protected from suicide as long as they stay "feminine" and subsumed within the family. This cultural diversity also points to the pitfalls of theorizing about clinical phenomena as if they were culture-free, and calls for culturally grounded theory, research. and practice.

AB This study explored the prevalence of filicide-suicide ideation among Taiwanese parents with school-aged children. Multiple risk factors associated with filicide-suicide ideation were assessed, and the potential effect of traditional family values was evaluated. A random sample of 1,564 parents was recruited from 21 elementary schools in a rural area of Taiwan. Potential risk factors, including demographics, family finance, psychological maladjustment, family interaction, and cultural beliefs, were further examined using a hierarchical logistic regression. Overall, 14.6% of the respondents reported having filicide-suicide ideation during the past year. The hierarchical logistic regression analysis showed that demographic factors including age, gender, and ethnicity had no significant effect. Family finances, depression, and conflict with the respondent's spouse were positively associated with filicide-suicide ideation. Finally, the parents' beliefs in traditional family values had a positive effect on filicide-suicide ideation. In other words, filicide-suicide thoughts were more common among those who upheld a strong parental responsibility for care giving and family solidarity. This study revealed a substantial prevalence of filicide-suicide ideation among local parents and identified a number of risk factors associated with those thoughts, namely family financial status, parental depression, and conflict with one's spouse. More importantly, the results highlighted the effect of traditional family values in the process. The potential intention of filicide-suicide as mercy killing and its cultural relevance were discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Models of suicidal behavior that assess the interplay of multiple risk factors are needed to better identify at-risk individuals during periods of elevated risk, including following psychiatric hospitalization. This study investigated contributions of facets of anger, gender, and sexual victimization to risk for suicide attempts after hospital discharge. Psychiatric patients (N = 748; ages 18-40; 44% female) recruited from 3 inpatient facilities were assessed during hospitalization and every 10 weeks during the year following discharge as part of the MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study. Multiple logistic regression models with facets of anger (disposition toward physiological arousal, hostile cognitions, and angry behavior) from the Novaco Anger Scale (Novaco, 1994), gender, and childhood sexual victimization history were used to predict suicide attempts in the year following hospital discharge. Facets of anger differentially predicted suicide attempts as a function of gender and sexual victimization history, over and above the variance accounted for by symptoms of depression, anxiety, and recent suicide attempts. In men, greater disposition toward angry behavior predicted an overall greater likelihood of a suicide attempt in the year following hospital discharge, particularly among men with childhood sexual victimization. In women with a history of childhood sexual victimization, physiological arousal predicted suicide attempts. Results indicate that facets of anger are relevant predictors of suicide attempts following hospital discharge for psychiatric patients with a history of childhood sexual victimization. Further, results suggest that incorporating gender and victimization history into models of risk for suicide can help clarify relationships between anger and self-directed violence.

AB Although some studies have examined the association between prescription opioid misuse and mental health outcomes, few studies have examined the effects of prescription opioid misuse on suicidal behaviors among adolescents. The objective of this study was to examine the association between prescription opioid misuse and suicidal ideation, suicide plan, and suicide attempt among adolescents. Data for this study came from the 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System. A sample of 8830 adolescents aged 14-18 years (50.9% female) were analyzed using logistic regression with suicidal ideation, suicide plan, and suicide attempt as outcome variables and prescription opioid misuse as the main explanatory variable. Of the 8830 adolescents, 13.3% ever misused prescription opioids; 17.7% experienced suicidal ideation, 13.3% made a suicide plan, and 6.5% attempted suicide during the past 12 months. In the multivariate logistic regression models, adolescent students who misused prescription opioids were 1.50 times more likely to have experienced suicidal ideation, 1.44 times more likely to have made a suicide plan, and 1.58 times more likely to have attempted suicide during the past 12 months when compared to their counterparts who did not misuse prescription opioids. Other significant predictors of suicidal behaviors include sexual minority, history of sexual assault, traditional bullying and cyberbullying victimization, feeling sad or hopeless, cigarette smoking, and illicit drug use. The findings of the present study demonstrate the harmful effects of prescription opioid misuse and its association with suicidal behaviors among adolescents.

AB Objective: To examine the impact of the Health Canada regulatory warnings regarding antidepressant (AD) prescribing on suicide rates in boys and girls under the age of 18 and aged 18 to 19 years in Canada between 2004 and 2009. We hypothesized that an increase in suicide rates would be specific to girls, reflecting higher AD prescribing rates in girls than boys.
   Method: We graphed and tested the difference between Canada-wide suicide rates before and after the regulatory warning periods (either from 1995 to 2006 or from 1995 to 2009) in boys and girls under the age of 18 or aged 18 to 19 years. For comparison with prior studies, we estimated rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals using either Poisson regression or negative binomial regression.
   Results: There was no statistically significant increase in suicide rates in girls under the age of 18, or aged 18 to 19 years in response to the AD regulatory warnings. In boys under the age of 18 or aged 18 to 19 years, suicide rates declined after 2003.
   Conclusions: We did not find increased rates of suicide after the AD regulatory warnings in boys or girls under the age of 18 or aged 18 to 19 years in Canada-wide rates. However, this does not rule out the possibility that such an effect occurred in some jurisdictions in girls and (or) the regulatory warnings prevented the trend toward declining suicide rates. Factors influencing the downward trend in boys merit further attention.

AB Background: Few controlled studies have examined social class as a risk factor for suicide in Korea.
   Aim: The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of social class on suicide risk in Korea.
   Methods: A case-control design was constructed from cause-of-death statistics for the period 1999 to 2001, in Korea, as published by the Korean National Statistical Office. The cases were defined as people aged between 20 and 64 who died by suicide, while the controls were defined as those who died of natural causes in the same age groups.
   Results and conclusions: The proportions and odds ratios for suicide were higher in young people than in elderly people, and higher for divorced subjects than for cohabitants. They were also higher for residents of rural areas, as opposed to residents of Seoul and other metropolitan areas, and for people in social classes III and IV, than they were for those in social class I. To control the variables that influence risk of suicide, such as age, marital status and area of residence, we used multiple logistic regression. Compared with class 1, risk of suicide was higher in social classes III and IV, in both sexes. The principal conclusion of this study is that, regardless of sex, lower social class constitutes a high risk for suicide in Korea, even after controlling for variables such as age, marital status and area of residence. We conclude that a well-controlled and balanced social welfare system could reduce suicide risk, especially among people in lower social class.

AB Aims: This study compared the cause-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and expected years of life lost (EYLL) among opioid-dependent individuals in the United States and Taiwan.
   Methods: Survival data came from two cohorts followed until 2014: The U.S. data were based on a randomized trial of 1267 opioid-dependent participants enrolled between 2006 and 2009; the Taiwan data were from a study of 983 individuals that began in 2006, when opioid agonist treatment (OAT) was implemented in Taiwan. SMRs were calculated for each national cohort and compared. Kaplan-Meier estimation was performed on the survival data, then lifespans were extrapolated to 70 years (840 months) to estimate life expectancy using a semi-parametric method. EYLLs for both cohorts were estimated by subtracting their life expectancies from the age- and gender-matched referents within the general population of their respective country.
   Results: Compared with age- and gender-matched referents, the SMRs were 3.2 for the U.S. sample and 7.8 for the Taiwan sample; the EYLLs were 7.7 and 16.4 years, respectively. Half of decedents died of unnatural causes in both cohorts; overdose deaths predominated in the U.S. and suicide in Taiwan.
   Conclusions: Our study identified differences by country in EYLL and causes of deaths. These findings suggest that intervention strategies to reduce mortality risk by overdose (particularly in the U.S.) and suicide (particularly in Taiwan) are urgently needed in these countries.

AB Objective: Suicide in the United States is a major preventable public health problem. Pharmacists need to be educated on suicide prevention strategies so that they can increase their own awareness and identify patients at-risk. A training program for pharmacists was used to provide skills necessary to recognize a crisis and the warning signs of suicide. The program's effect on the participant's general perception, self-efficacy, and attitude towards suicide prevention was examined.
   Setting: Various academic, health care, and professional meetings throughout San Diego County.
   Practice innovation: First Question, Persuade, and Refer training program targeting pharmacists.
   Evaluation: A self-administered presurvey, postsurvey and, Program Outcome Evaluation were given to participants of the suicide training program. Items included demographics, general perception, self-efficacy, and attitude toward suicide prevention. Descriptive statistics were used to describe participants' demographics. t tests were used to compare general perception, attitudes, and self-efficacy scores between pretest and post-program evaluation survey responses. Nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank analyses for matched pairs were used to compare survey responses that asked about attitudes before and after trainings. Regression analyses were conducted to assess factors associated with general perception, self-efficacy, and attitudes.
   Results: Participants were more likely to update knowledge after training and reported more confidence to make an intervention for a patient at risk for suicide.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that a suicide prevention training program helped pharmacist respondents build confidence in several self-efficacy areas relating to detection of suicide signs, response to patients with suicidal thoughts, reassurance for patients, and provision of resources and referrals.

AB In an emergency department (ED) sample, we investigated the concordance between identification of suicide-related visits through standardized comprehensive chart review versus a subset of 3 specific chart elements: ICD-9-CM codes, free-text presenting complaints, and free-text physician discharge diagnoses. The method for this study was review of medical records for adults (>= 18 years) at 8 EDs across the United States. A total of 3,776 charts were reviewed. A combination of the 3 chart elements (ICD-9-CM, presenting complaints, and discharge diagnoses) provided the most robust data with 85% sensitivity, 96% specificity, 92% PPV, and 92% NPV. These findings highlight the use of key discrete fields in the medical record that can be extracted to facilitate identification of whether an ED visit was suicide-related.

AB Objectives: Disability, which has been proved to be associated with suicide and suicidal ideation, has received little attention in relation to suicidal attempts among the elderly. The aim of this study was to explore the influence of disability on attempted suicide within this demographic.Method: A multi-stage cluster sample of 8399 residents aged 60 or more was investigated from 15 communities in Shanghai, China. Disability was measured using the Lawton instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) scale.Results: The prevalence of attempted suicide in the elderly was 0.75%. Specific IADL disabilities, including shopping (OR = 3.01, 95% CI = 1.56-5.81), preparing meals (OR = 4.12, 95% CI = 2.12-8.00), housekeeping (OR = 2.48, 95% CI = 1.01-6.06), doing laundry (OR = 2.82, 95% CI = 1.09-7.35), using transport (OR = 3.10, 95% CI = 1.36-6.99) and medical care (OR = 4.41, 95% CI = 2.10-9.17), were significantly and independently associated with attempted suicide in the elderly. The presence of at least one such disability was associated with an almost threefold increase in the attempted suicide rate, and the presence of five or more IADL disabilities was associated with an approximate fivefold increase in the attempted suicide rate.Conclusion: Specific IADL disabilities, such as preparing meals or dealing with medical care, may be significant predictive factors for risk of suicidal attempts among the elderly. Therefore, elderly people with certain disabilities should be considered for suicide prevention interventions and should be supported in IADL as much as possible.

AB Background: Previous suicide assessment research has led to standard predictors of risk. Despite this, there are approximately 30,000 suicides per year in the United States, 5% to 6% of which occur in hospitals. The primary purpose of this study is to improve our ability to assess risk and intervene successfully.
   Method: Charts from 76 patients who committed suicide while in the hospital, or immediately after discharge, were reviewed. The week before suicide was rated for both standard risk predictors and, using items from the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (SADS), for presence and severity of symptoms found to be correlated with acute risk in recent studies.
   Results: Regarding standard predictors, only 49% (N = 37) had any prior suicide attempt and 25% (N = 19) were admitted for this reason. Thirty-nine percent (30/76) were admitted for suicidal ideation, but 78% denied suicidal ideation at their last communication about this; 46% (N = 35) showed no evidence of psychosis; of those on precautions (N = 45), 51% (N = 23) were on q 15 minute suicide checks or 1:1 observation; and 28% (N = 21) had a no-suicide contract in effect. On SADS ratings, 79% (N = 60) met criteria for severe or extreme anxiety and/or agitation.
   Conclusion: Standard risk assessments and standard precautions used were of limited value in protecting this group from suicide. Adding severity of anxiety and agitation to our current assessments may help identify patients at acute risk and suggest effective treatment interventions. The importance of a matched comparison group to ascertain if this sample can be blindly discriminated from inpatients who do not commit suicide is clear.

AB Depression is a common disorder among adolescents and is associated with a high risk of suicide. Suicide is the third leading cause of death among adolescents in the United States. Currently, there are only two evidence-based psychotherapies for adolescence depression: cognitive-behavioral therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy. Furthermore, psychosocial interventions that specifically target suicidal behavior in adolescents are even fewer in number than treatments for depression. This article will review the psychosocial interventions for depression and suicidality in adolescents and will describe a recently developed treatment that is under study for depressed suicidal adolescents.

AB This paper provides an analysis of the link between suicidal behaviors and human capital formation of young adults in the United States. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we estimate the effects of suicide thoughts and attempts on the probability of engaging in work or attending school. The richness of the data set allows us to implement several strategies to control for unobserved heterogeneity and the potential reverse causality. These strategies include using a large set of control variables that are likely to be correlated with both suicidal behavior and the outcome measures, an instrumental variables method, and fixed effects analyses from the subsamples of twin and sibling pairs. Results from the different identification strategies consistently indicate that both suicide thoughts and suicide attempts decrease the likelihood that a young adult individual engages in work or schooling.

AB It is hypothesized that ratings of emotional stimuli are affected by a constant threat of traumatic events. Ratings of valence and arousal on the International Affective Picture System from young adults in the United States were compared to those of young Israeli adults. Israelis rated the pictures as less negative and less positive than did participants from the United States. Israeli women gave higher arousal ratings compared to the American women. These differences may be due to compulsory military service in Israel, during which exposure to traumatic events is more likely to occur, and to the timing of the study which followed a year of frequent suicide bomb attacks. The authors suggest that these findings may reflect mild symptoms of stress disorders.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: It is estimated that every year 1 million people die all around the world due to suicide. The average rate of suicide in the world is reported as 16/100 000. In this study, we aimed to evaluate and discuss the suicide cases in our city Eskisehir that is located in western Anatolia.
   DESIGN AND SETTINGS: This is a retrospective study covering the period 1997-2011.
   METHODS: All deaths in Eskisehir caused due to the consumption of forensic medicines in a 15-year period between 1997 and 2011 were evaluated retrospectively. A total of 553 cases were determined to be suicidal following both forensic and criminal investigations, and were included in the study. Furthermore, death examination and autopsy reports were investigated, and judicial investigation records were also taken into account.
   RESULTS: In this period, the average rate of suicide in our city was determined as 5.1/100 000 of which 71.4% of the cases were male. It was determined that the suicides most commonly occurred between the ages of 19 and 29 (32.4%, n=179). The most commonly encountered suicide method was hanging (60.9%, n=337).
   CONCLUSION: It was ascertained that the suicide rate in our city was lower than the average rate in the world, but it was higher than the average rate in Turkey. Unemployment was determined as the most common risk factor in our study. A follow-up should be provided for people with a history of attempting to commit suicide or with a tendency to committing suicide due to a psychological disorder.

AB Since 11 September 2001, Europe has suffered multiple jihadi attacks but the United States has not. This American exceptionalism has been attributed to the special qualities of U.S. Muslims, who are seen as politically better integrated and less sympathetic toward radical politics than other Muslims. This article tests the exceptionalism hypothesis by comparing results from a 2007 Pew poll of U.S. Muslims with results from 2006-2007 START polls of Muslims in Morocco, Egypt, Pakistan, and Indonesia. On questions about religious identity, attitude toward Al Qaeda, U.S. intentions in the War on Terrorism, and suicide terrorism, U.S. Muslims differed only slightly from comparison Muslims.

AB Objectives. We examined migration to the United States as a risk factor for suicidal behavior among people of Mexican origin.
   Methods. We pooled data from 2 nationally representative surveys in the United States (2001-2003; n=1284) and Mexico (2001-2002; n=5782). We used discrete time survival models to account for time-varying and time-invariant characteristics, including psychiatric disorders.
   Results. Risk for suicidal ideation was higher among Mexicans with a family member in the United States (odds ratio [OR]=1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.06,2.11), Mexican-born immigrants who arrived in the United States at 12 years or younger (OR=1.84; 95% CI=1.09, 3.09), and US-born Mexican Americans (OR=1.56; 95% CI=1.03, 2.38) than among Mexicans with neither a history of migration to the United States nor a family member currently living there. Risk for suicide attempts was also higher among Mexicans with a family member in the United States (OR= 1.68; 95% CI=1.13, 2.52) and US-born Mexican Americans (OR=1.97; 95% CI=1.06, 3.65). Selection bias caused by differential migration or differential return migration of persons at higher risk of suicidal ideation or attempt did not account for these findings.
   Conclusions. Public health efforts should focus on the impact of Mexico-US migration on family members of migrants and on US-born Mexican Americans. (Am J Public Health. 2009;99:728-733. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2008.135160)

AB This study examined differences in suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SAs) among veterans with chronic pain. Pain-specific variables, including catastrophic thinking, disability, and sensory, affective, and evaluative pain descriptors, were a focus. Structured diagnostic and clinical interviews were conducted to examine SI/SA and mental health. Veterans completed the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale to assess Axis I symptoms and suicidal behavior(s). Self-report questionnaires were used to evaluate the participants' subjective experience of chronic pain, which included the McGill Pain Questionnaire, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, and Pain Disability Index. The findings add to previous literature by suggesting pain-related catastrophic thinking specifically is related to elevated risk for SA, whereas affective and sensory pain are associated with SI. The study results support the need to assess pain from a multifaceted perspective and to examine the different experiences of pain, such as sensory and affective constructs, when discussing suicide risk in veterans.

AB Objective: The object of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of the aggregate relationship between alcohol and homicide in Russia and in the United States. The comparison was based on the magnitude of the alcohol effect, the alcohol attributable fraction (AAF), and the degree to which total consumption could account for trends in homicide. Method: We analyzed total and sex-specific homicide rates for the age groups 15-64 years, 15-34 years, and 35-64 years. The study period was 1959-1998 for Russia and 1950-2002 for the United States. For the United States, alcohol consumption was gauged by sales of alcohol; for Russia, estimated unrecorded consumption was included as well. The data were analyzed through autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modeling. Results: The results show that, for Russia as well as for the United States, a 1-L increase in consumption was associated with an increase in homicides of about 10%, although the absolute effect was markedly larger in Russia because of differences in homicide rates. The AAF estimates suggested that 73% and 57% of the homicides would be attributable to alcohol in Russia and in the United States, respectively. Most of the temporal variation in the Russian homicide rate could be accounted for by the trend in drinking, whereas the U.S. trend in total alcohol consumption had a more limited ability to predict the trend in homicides. Conclusions: We conclude that the role of alcohol in homicide seems to be larger in Russia than in the United States. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs, 72, 723-730, 2011)

   SELF-HARM; PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSES; COMPLETED SUICIDE; UNITED-STATES;

AB The object of this article is to review the past decade of research on teenage suicide, with a particular emphasis on epidemiologic trends by age, gender and indigenous ethnicity. As such, a review of research literature from 2003 to 2014 was conducted via a comprehensive search of relevant psychological and medical databases. Wide gaps in our knowledge base exist concerning the true extent of teenage suicide due to lack of data, particularly in developing countries, resulting in a Western bias. The gender paradox of elevated suicidality in females with higher completed suicide rates in males is observed in teenage populations worldwide, with the notable exceptions of China and India. Native and indigenous ethnic minority teens are at significantly increased risk of suicide in comparison to general population peers. Often those with the highest need for mental health care (such as the suicidal adolescent) have least access to therapeutic support.
   Globally, suicide in teenagers remains a major public health concern. Further focused research concerning completed suicides of youth below the age of 18 is required across countries and cultures to understand more about risk as children progress through adolescence. Gender and ethnic variations in suicidality are embedded within cultural, historical, psychological, relational and socio-economic domains. Worldwide, the absence of child/adolescent-specific mental health policies may delay the development of care and suicide prevention. Overall, it is vital that clinicians adopt a holistic approach that incorporates an awareness of age and gender influences, and that cultural competency informs tailored and evaluated intervention programmes.

ID PERIOD
AB The rise to power of the National Socialist (Nazi) party led by Adolf Hitler and the subsequent tumultuous 12 years of their rule in Germany resulted in catastrophes including World War II, the most destructive war ever, and the premeditated and systematic murder of 5 to 6 million European Jews. Despite their notable contributions to the academic excellence that existed in German-speaking countries at that time, Jewish physicians were particularly vulnerable to persecution and death. Between 1933 and 1938, a series of repressive measures eliminated them from the practice of medicine in Germany and other countries. Although some died in concentration camps and others committed suicide, many were able to emigrate from Europe. Dermatology in the United States particularly benefited from the influx of several stellar Jewish dermatologists who were major contributors to the subsequent flowering of academic dermatology in the United States. A number of representative biographies of these immigrants are briefly recounted to illustrate their lasting influence on our specialty.

AB Background: There is an extreme need for planning to prevent suicide in developing countries. It is necessary to detect the risk factors of this problem and plan to control them. The aim of this study was to determine a predictive model for Suicide attempt based on its risk factors in order to give information for planning therapeutic, preventive, and educational interventions in Karaj City.
   Methods: The setting was Karaj City, Tehran Province, Iran and the study design was cross-sectional. In this study, data were collected by using the World Health Organization (WHO) questionnaire of SUPRE-MISS study. The questionnaire included questions about demographic characteristics, personal and family history of suicide behaviors, use of psychotropic drugs, physical and mental disorders, and community stress. All parts of the questionnaire were filled out by interview. A total of 2300 individuals participated in this study having considered the 1.2% prevalence of suicide attempt in the pilot study, and with type one error rate of 5%, the sample size was calculated as 2300.
   Results: About 65% of the participants were females. Most of the participants had high-school education (48%) and 57.2% of them were married. Housewives included most of the occupation categories (46%). The mean age of the suicide attempters and nonattempters was 26 (+/- 9) and 32 (+/- 13) years, respectively. This difference was statistically significant. Younger age, female sex, history of mental disorders, lifelong use of tobacco and alcohol, and unemployment were the independent predictors of suicide attempt.
   Conclusion: Prevention of suicide is possible by understanding its risk factors and planning to control them.

AB Objectives:We sought to identify subgroups of individuals based on patterns of psychological health problems (PH; e.g., depressive symptoms, hazardous drinking) and family maltreatment (FM; e.g., child and partner abuse).
   Method:We analyzed data from very large surveys of United States Air Force active duty members with romantic partners and children.
   Results:Latent class analyses indicated six replicable patterns of PH problems and FM. Five of these classes, representing approximate to 98% of survey participants, were arrayed ordinally, with increasing risk of multiple PH problems and FM. A sixth group defied this ordinal pattern, with pronounced rates of FM and externalizing PH problems, but without correspondingly high rates/levels of internalizing PH problems.
   Conclusions:Ramifications of these results for intervention are discussed.

There is evidence both from studies of individuals and time series aggregate studies, mostly at the national level, of substantial alcohol involvement in suicide, but no small-area, longitudinal studies have been carried out. The present study is the first that is both longitudinal and based on a large number of small spatial units, California zip codes, a level of resolution permitting analysis of the relationship between local alcohol access and suicide rates over time.
   Method:
   Longitudinal data were obtained from 581 consistently defined zip code areas over 6 years (1995-2000) using data from the California Index Locations Database, a geographic information system that contains both population and place information with spatial attributes for the entire state. Measures obtained from each zip code included population characteristics (e.g., median age) and place characteristics (e.g., numbers of retail and alcohol outlets) which were related in separate analyses to (i) suicide mortality and (ii) the number of hospitalizations for injuries caused by suicide attempts. The effect of place characteristics in zip code areas adjacent to each of the 581 local zip codes (spatial lags) was also assessed. Analysis methods were random effects models corrected for spatial autocorrelation.
   Results:
   Completed suicide rates were higher in zip code areas with greater local and lagged bar densities; and higher in areas with greater local but not lagged off-premise outlet densities. Whereas completed suicide rates were lower among blacks and Hispanics, completed suicide rates were higher among low income, older whites living in less densely populated areas, that is, rural areas. Rates of suicide attempts were higher in zip code areas with greater local but not lagged bar densities, and higher among low income younger whites living in smaller households and in rural areas. Rates of attempted suicide were also higher among blacks. Completed suicide and suicide attempt rates were lower in zip code areas with greater local restaurant densities; there were no lagged effects for restaurants.
   Conclusions:
   Bar densities in particular appear related to suicide, meaning, because this is an aggregate-level spatial analysis, that suicides, both attempted and completed, occur at greater rates in rural community areas with greater bar densities. Because the suicide rate is highest in rural areas, this study suggests that although the number of completed and attempted suicides is no doubt greater in absolute numbers in urban areas, the suicide rate, both completed and attempted, is greater in rural areas, which draws attention, perhaps much needed, to the problems of rural America.

AB Little is known about the psychological state of those who leave a stigmatized group. We examined individuals who previously belonged to a stigmatized group, the overweight, and then became normal weight. Negative stereotypes, including those relating to obesity, are internalized from the time of childhood onward; therefore, it was assumed they would become lingering self-stereotypes among individuals who were no longer externally targeted. Drawing on a nationally representative sample, we examined for the first time whether formerly overweight individuals are susceptible to any anxiety disorder, any depressive disorder, and suicide attempts. As predicted, the likelihood of any anxiety disorder and any depressive disorder for the formerly overweight group was significantly greater than for the consistently normal-weight group, and not significantly different from the consistently overweight group. Further, the formerly overweight group was significantly more likely to attempt suicide than the other groups. Also as predicted, perceived weight discrimination partially mediated the relationship between weight status and these outcomes. The cohort consisted of 33,604 participants in the United States. The results suggest that losing a self-image shaped by stigma is a more protracted process than losing weight. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Adverse drug reactions and interactions are among the major causes of death in the United States. Antidepressants have been reported as causing suicide and homicide and share the class attribute of frequently producing akathisia, a state of severe restlessness associated with thoughts of death and violence. Medical examiners can now identify some pharmacogenetic interactions that cause drugs, deemed safe for most, to be lethal to others. Such deaths do not yet include medication-induced, akathisia-related suicides and homicides. An extrapyramidal side effect, akathisia is a manifestation of drug toxicity whose causes lie, inter alia, in drugs, doses, and co-prescribed medications that inhibit and compete for metabolizing enzymes, which may themselves be defective. In this paper, we report our investigation into adverse drug reactions/interactions in three persons who committed homicide, two also intending suicide, while on antidepressants prescribed for stressful life events. Their histories of medication use, adverse reactions and reasons for changes in medications are presented. DNA samples were screened for variants in the cytochrome P450 gene family; that produce drug metabolizing enzymes. All three cases exhibit genotype-based diminished metabolic capability that, in combination with their enzyme inhibiting/competing medications, decreased metabolism further and are the likely cause of these catastrophic events.

AB Background: Two counter trends in injury mortality have been separately reported in the US in recent times - a declining suicide rate and a rapidly rising unintentional poisoning mortality rate. Poisoning suicides are especially difficult to detect, and injury of undetermined intent is the underlying cause-of-death category most likely to reflect this difficulty. We compare suicide and poisoning mortality trends over two decades in a preliminary assessment of their independence and implications for suicide misclassification.
   Methods: Description of overall and gender- and age-specific trends using national mortality data from WISQARS, the Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System, maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Subjects were the 936,633 residents dying in the 50 states and the District of Columbia between 1987 and 2006 whose underlying cause of death was classified as suicide, unintentional poisoning, or injury mortality of undetermined intent.
   Results: The official US suicide rate declined 18% between 1987 and 2000, from 12.71 to 10.43 deaths per 100,000 population. It then increased to 11.15 deaths per 100,000 by 2006, a 7% rise. By contrast to these much smaller rate changes for suicide, the unintentional poisoning mortality rate rose more than fourfold between 1987 and 2006, from 2.19 to 9.22 deaths per 100,000. Only the population aged 65 years and older showed a sustained decline in the suicide rate over the entire observation period. Consistently highest in gender- age comparisons, the elderly male rate declined by 35%. The elderly female rate declined by 43%. Unlike rate trends for the non-elderly, both declines appeared independent of corresponding mortality trends for unintentional poisoning and poisoning of undetermined intent. The elderly also deviated from younger counterparts by having a smaller proportion of their injury deaths of undetermined intent classified as poisoning. Poisoning manifested as a less common method of suicide for this group than other decedents, except for those aged 15-24 years. Although remaining low, the undetermined poisoning mortality rate increased over the observation period.
   Conclusions: The official decline in the suicide rate between 1987 and 2000 may have been a partial artifact of misclassification of non-elderly suicides within unintentional poisoning mortality. We recommend in-depth national, regional, and local population-based research investigations of the poisoning-suicide nexus, and endorse calls for widening the scope of the definition of suicide and evaluation of its risk factors.

AB Key PointsQuestionAre suicide attempts familial, and is familial aggregation explained by comorbid mental disorders? FindingsIn this study of data of 1119 adult probands and 5355 first-degree relatives, suicide attempts were moderately familial and associated with mental disorders, particularly mood disorders. Social anxiety disorder in probands was statistically significantly associated with suicide attempts in relatives. MeaningSuicide attempts appear to be familial, but much of the familial aggregation may be explained by comorbid mental conditions; the increase in suicide attempt risk among people with a familial diathesis for social anxiety or its underlying components may provide insight into the mechanisms and prevention of suicide.
   ImportanceClarification of the joint influence of familial patterns of suicide attempts and comorbid mental disorders can enhance the understanding and prevention of suicide attempts. ObjectiveTo investigate the familial patterns of suicide attempts and comorbid mental disorders and their associations in a 2-site family study of mood and anxiety disorders. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsData were obtained from 2 parallel community-based family studies conducted in the United States (National Institute of Mental Health [NIMH] study) and in Lausanne, Switzerland (PsyCoLaus study), on the comorbidity of mood and anxiety disorders. The study sample comprised 1119 adult probands and 5355 first-degree relatives. Data were collected and analyzed from October 2004 to December 2016. Main Outcomes and MeasuresLifetime suicide attempt and mental disorders in first-degree relatives, obtained through direct interviews or family history reports. ResultsThe study included 1119 adult probands (675 female [60.3%] and a mean [SD] age of 50 [12.0] years) and 5355 first-degree relatives (2752 female [51.4%] and a mean [SD] age of 52 [1.5] years). Of these participants, 90 (8.0%) of 1119 probands and 199 (3.7%) of 5355 relatives had a lifetime history of suicide attempt. Those with such a history had higher rates of all mental disorders, a greater number of disorders, and statistically significantly poorer current and lifetime global functioning. After adjustment for age and sex, a statistically significant association between suicide attempts in probands and in relatives was found at the NIMH site (OR,2.6; 95% CI,1.5-4.7), at the Lausanne site (OR, 3.1; 95% CI,1.6-6.0), and in the combined data (OR,2.9; 95% CI,1.9-4.5). All mood disorder subtypes and substance use disorders were statistically significantly associated with suicide attempts. The familial association between lifetime suicide attempts in probands and relatives was not statistically significant for the combined sample (OR,1.6; 95% CI,1.0-2.7) after adjustment for comorbid conditions in probands and relatives. Social anxiety disorder in probands was associated with suicide attempts in relatives (OR,2.4; 95% CI,1.7-3.5) after controlling for comorbid mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders. Conclusions and RelevanceFamiliality of suicide attempts appears to be explained by a history of mental disorders among those with suicide attempts; the novel finding of a common familial diathesis for suicide attempts and social anxiety, particularly in combination with mood disorders, has heuristic value for future research and may be a risk marker that can inform prevention efforts.
   This study examines participant data from the National Institute of Mental Health family study in the United States and the PsyCoLaus family study in Lausanne, Switzerland, for underlying mental disorders and history of suicidal behavior among adults in the same family.

AB Introduction: Recently there was a debate concerning the relationship between the economic crisis and an increase in attempted and completed suicides in Europe and especially in Greece. The aim of the current study was to calculate the rates of attempted and completed suicide per year in the county of Thessaloniki, Macedonia, northern Greece, for the years 2000-12, and to investigate their relationship with unemployment.
   Material and methods: The archive of the Emergency Outpatient Units of three hospitals was investigated and the results were projected to the county population. Data from the Hellenic statistics authority concerning regional general population and suicides and unemployment were used.
   Results: The rate of attempted suicides was 16.69-40.34 per 10(5) inhabitants for males and 41.43-110.82 for females. Medication was the preferred method for 95.93%. The completed suicide rates varied from 3.62 to 547 for males and from 0.19 to 1.95 per 10(5) inhabitants for females. The male attempt rate correlated negatively with regional male unemployment (-0.63). For females the respected value was similar (-0.72). Concerning competed suicide rates, the respected values were 0.34 and 0.65. The attempt was repeated by 15.34%; almost half-repeated within the same year and 75% within two years. The female to male ratio varied significantly across years with 2:1 (more females) being the probable value for attempts and 1:3.6 (more males) for completed suicides.
   Conclusion: This is the first study from Greece reporting rates on the basis of hospital archives. Attempt and suicide rates are low in Greece. Attempts are negatively and suicides are positively correlated with unemployment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Differentiating suicide attempters from suicide ideators has been named a critical suicidology frontier (Klonsky & May, 2013). Per Bronfenbrenner's (1977, 1994) ecological systems theory, risk/protective factors from four ecological levels (individual, family, workplace, and community) were used to predict last year suicide attempt status among active duty service members expressing suicide ideation. Method: Active duty U.S. Air Force members (N = 52,780, 79.3% male, 79.2% non-Hispanic White, M age = 31.8 years) anonymously completed an online community assessment administered biennially at 82 bases worldwide. Last year suicide ideation and attempts were concurrently measured, as were an array of co-occurring risk and protective factors. Results: Among the 1,927 (approximately 4%) service members self-reporting suicidal ideation, 152 also reported a last year suicide attempt (7.9% of the ideators, 8.7% of men vs. 6.1% of women). However, in multivariate models, military member sex was not a significant moderator. In bivariate models, numerous individual, family/spouse/parent, and community factors were associated with suicide attempt status. In the final multivariate model for the whole sample, risk for a last year attempt was associated with years in the military, social support, and alcohol use problems, but not depression. Among active duty military in relationships, attempt status risk was associated with years in the military, social support, and intimate partner violence victimization. However, the effect sizes for these models were small. Conclusions: Beyond a focus on depression, addressing alcohol misuse, facilitating resilient and nonviolent couple/family relationships, and increasing social support may enhance suicide attempt prevention efforts among military members.

AB Background: Although suicide ranks 10th as a cause of death in the United States, and 1st among active military personnel, there are surprisingly few evidence-based therapies addressing suicidality, and development of new treatments is limited. This paper describes a clinical trial testing a novel therapy for reducing suicide risk in military veterans. The intervention, Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Preventing Suicide Behavior (MBCT-S), is a 10-week group intervention adapted from an existing treatment for depression (Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy - MBCT). MBCT-S incorporates the Safety Planning Intervention, which is currently implemented throughout the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) for veterans at high suicide risk
   Methods: MBCT-S is being tested in a VHA setting using an intention-to-treat, two-group randomized trial design in which 164 high suicide risk veterans are randomized to either VHA Treatment As Usual (TAU; n = 82) or TAU + MBCT-S (n = 82). Our primary outcome measure, suicide-related event, defined to include suicide preparatory behaviors, self-harm behavior with suicidal or indeterminate intent, suicide-related hospitalizations and Emergency Department (ED) visits, will be measured through five assessments administered by blinded assessors between baseline and 12 months post-baseline. We will measure suicide attempts and suicide deaths as a secondary outcome, because of their anticipated low incidence during the study period. Secondary outcomes also include severity of suicidal ideation, hopelessness and depression.
   Significance: This study has the potential to significantly enhance the quality and efficiency of VHA care for veterans at suicide risk and to substantially improve the quality of life for veterans and their families. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Approximately 1 in 4 deaths of patients maintained on dialysis in the United States is preceded by a decision to discontinue treatment. Once considered to be a form of suicide, dialysis discontinuation is now increasingly common in most countries that are fortunate enough to offer renal replacement therapies. Given an aging and progressively sicker chronic kidney disease patient population, the rate of terminating dialysis is likely to increase. The literature on dialysis discontinuation includes studies principally from Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The research is reviewed, critiqued, and examined to determine its relevance to practice. Future issues include the need to explore variability in dialysis practice as well as employment of a more patient-centered approach that is consistent with modern palliative medicine.

AB The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that young people who perceive their parents to have alcohol problems are more likely to self-injure, have suicide ideation, and to attempt suicide than young people without parental alcohol problems. We also tested whether the association between parental alcohol problems and self-injury, suicide ideation, and suicide attempt among young people differed depending on the gender of the child and the parent. Data came from the Danish National Youth Study 2014, a web-based national survey. A total of 75,853 high school and vocational school students participated. Self-injury, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts were outcomes and the main exposure variables were perceived parental alcohol problems, gender of the parent with alcohol problems, cohabitation with a parent with alcohol problems, and severity of the parents' alcohol problems. Young people with parental alcohol problems had higher odds of self-injury [boys: OR = 1.59 (95% CI 1.40-1.82); girls: OR = 1.84 (95% CI 1.69-1.99)], suicidal ideation [boys: OR = 1.81 (95% CI 1.59-2.06); girls: OR 1.74 (95% CI 1.59-1.89)], and suicide attempt [boys: OR = 2.10 (95% CI 1.63-2.71); girls: OR = 2.09 (95% CI 1.80-2.42)] compared to young people without parental alcohol problems. Girls with parental alcohol problems had higher odds of self-injury than boys with parental alcohol problems, whereas no gender differences were found for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Also no differences were found depending on the gender of the parent with alcohol problems. This study shows that young people with parental alcohol problems have higher odds of self-injury, suicide ideation, and suicide attempts.

AB Introduction and aimsResearch indicates that parental divorce and parental alcohol abuse independently increase likelihood of offspring lifetime suicide attempt. However, when experienced together, only parental alcohol abuse significantly increased odds of suicide attempt. It is unclear to what extent differences in the effect of maternal versus paternal alcohol use exist on adult offspring lifetime suicide attempt risk. This study examined the influences of parental divorce and maternal-paternal histories of alcohol problems on adult offspring lifetime suicide attempt.
   Design and MethodsThe sample consisted of participants from the 2001-2002 National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. The simultaneous effect of childhood or adolescent parental divorce and maternal and paternal history of alcohol problems on offspring lifetime suicide attempt was estimated using a logistic regression model with an interaction term for demographics and parental history of other emotional and behavioural problems.
   ResultsParental divorce and maternal-paternal alcohol problems interacted to differentially influence the likelihood of offspring lifetime suicide attempt. Experiencing parental divorce and either maternal or paternal alcohol problems nearly doubled the likelihood of suicide attempt. Divorce and history of alcohol problems for both parents tripled the likelihood.
   Discussion and ConclusionIndividuals who experienced parental divorce as children or adolescents and who have a parent who abuses alcohol are at elevated risk for lifetime suicide attempt. These problem areas should become a routine part of assessment to better identify those at risk for lifetime suicide attempt and to implement early and targeted intervention to decrease such risk.

AB While increased suicidal tendencies among cancer patients have been well documented, there has been no specific examination of suicide and gastric cancer. The purpose of this study is to characterize suicide incidence among patients diagnosed with gastric cancer from 1973 to 2013 and identify variables associated with higher suicide rates. Patients with gastric cancer were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database of the National Cancer Institute. The study included clinical and demographic data from 1973 to 2013. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated. Comparisons with the general US population were based on mortality data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control using the Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System. Multivariable logistic regression models generated odds ratios (ORs) to assess factors associated with increased suicide in gastric malignancy. There were 210 suicides for patients with gastric cancer (SMR, 3.21; 95% CI: 2.80-3.67). Female gender (SMR 8.54), White race (SMR 4.08), age <= 39 years (SMR 3.06), and age 70-79 years (SMR 2.90), were found to be significant for an increased incidence of suicide compared with the general population. There was not a statistically significant relationship between suicide and marital status, income, mode of radiation therapy, and the role of surgical intervention. Approximately 77% of deaths by suicide occurred within the first year following diagnosis. Female gender, White race, age <= 39 years, and age 70-79 years are factors associated with increased risk of suicide in patients with gastric cancer. These results, coupled with further studies and analyses, will be used to formulate a comprehensive suicide risk factor scoring system for screening all cancer patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Many older adults who die by suicide have had recent contact with a primary care physician. As the risk-assessment and referral process for suicide is not readily comparable to procedures for other high-risk behaviors, it is important to identify areas in need of quality improvement (QI).
   OBJECTIVE: Identify patterns in physician-patient communication regarding suicide to inform QI interventions.
   DESIGN: Qualitative thematic analysis of video-taped clinical encounters in which suicide was discussed.
   PARTICIPANTS: Adult primary care patients (n = 385) 65 years and older and their primary care physicians.
   RESULTS:Mental health was discussed in 22% of encounters (n = 85), with suicide content found in less than 2% (n = 6). Three patterns of conversation were characterized: (1) Arguing that "Life's Not That Bad." In this scenario, the physician strives to convince the patient that suicide is unwarranted, which results in mutual fatigue and discouragement. (2) "Engaging in Chitchat." Here the physician addresses psychosocial matters in a seemingly aimless manner with no clear therapeutic goal. This results in a superficial and misleading connection that buries meaningful risk assessment amidst small talk. (3) "Identify, assess, andaEuro broken vertical bar?" This pattern is characterized by acknowledging distress, communicating concern, eliciting information, and making treatment suggestions, but lacks clearly articulated treatment planning or structured follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: The physicians in this sample recognized and implicitly acknowledged suicide risk in their older patients, but all seemed unable to go beyond mere assessment. The absence of clearly articulated treatment plans may reflect a lack of a coherent framework for managing suicide risk, insufficient clinical skills, and availability of mental health specialty support required to address suicide risk effectively. To respond to suicide's numerous challenges to the primary care delivery system, QI strategies will require changes to physician education and may require enhancing practice support.

AB Objectives: Older adults have high rates of suicide and typically seek care in primary medical practices. Older adults often do not directly or spontaneously report thoughts of suicide, which can impede suicide prevention efforts. Therefore, the use of additional approaches to suicide risk detection is needed, including the use of screening tools. The objective of this study was to assess whether brief screens for depression have acceptable operating characteristics in identifying suicide ideation among older primary care patients and to examine potential sex differences in the screen's accuracy.
   Methods: We administered the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), which includes a 5-item GDS subscale (GDS-SI) designed to screen for suicide ideation, to a cross-sectional cohort of 626 primary care patients (235 men, 391 women) 65 years of age or older in the Northeastern United States. We assessed presence of suicide ideation with items from the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition.
   Results: Patients expressing suicide ideation (n = 69) scored higher on the GDS and GDS-SI than those who did not (n = 557). A GDS cut score of 4 maximized sensitivity (0.754) and specificity (0.815), producing an area under the curve of 0.844 (P < .001) and positive and negative predictive values of 0.335 and 0.964, respectively. Optimal cut scores were 5 for men and 3 for women. A GDS-SI cut score of 1 was optimal for the total sample and for both men and women.
   Conclusions: The GDS and GDS-SI accurately identify older patients with suicide ideation. Research is needed to examine their acceptability and barriers to routine use in primary care. (J Am Board Fam Med 2010;23:260-269.)

AB There is strong consensus in the research literature that adolescent and adult men who report same-sex sexual orientations, identities, and behaviors are at higher risk for suicide. Recent studies of general adolescent suicide risk have identified developmental trajectories that peak during the teenage years. Because the adolescent years are characterized by the development and heightened awareness of gender roles and sexual scripts closely tied to dominant cultural ideals of masculinity and heterosexuality, an adolescent-focused developmental trajectory for suicide risk might be particularly relevant for males with adolescent same-sex sexual orientations. We provide the first prospective examination of adolescent-specific risk for suicidality based on adolescent same-sex sexual orientation using data from the United States, the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Tracing suicide ideation and attempts across four assessments from adolescence (Wave 1 average age 15.3 years) to young adulthood (Wave 4 average age 28.2), we documented that the risk for suicidal thoughts and attempts for adolescent same-sex attracted males is developmental in nature. Specifically, the risk for suicidal thoughts and attempts for males with same-sex attractions is largely limited to the adolescent years. These results offer new insights for suicide prevention and intervention for male adolescents and adults with same-sex sexual orientations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A prior meta-analysis found that the World Health Organization Brief Intervention and Contact Program (WHO BIC) significantly reduces suicide risk. WHO BIC has not been studied in high-income countries. We piloted an adapted version of WHO BIC on an inpatient mental health unit in the United States. We assessed the feasibility and acceptability. We also evaluated changes in suicidal ideation, hopelessness, and connectedness using a repeated measures analysis of variance. Of 13 eligible patients, 9 patients enrolled. Patients experienced significant improvements in suicidal ideation, hopelessness, and connectedness at 1 and 3 months (Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, F(2,16) = 14.96, p < 0.01; Beck Hopelessness Scale, F(2,16) = 5.88, p < 0.05; perceived burdensomeness subscale, F(2,16) = 10.97, p < 0.013; and thwarted belongingness subscale, F(2,16) = 4.77, p < 0.03). Patients were highly satisfied. An adapted version of WHO BIC may be feasible to implement in a high-resource setting, but trials need to confirm efficacy.

AB Objective: Given the recent publication of Dutch guidelines for euthanasia of the mentally ill, our aim in this paper is to review the clinical role of the psychiatrist in assessing patients who seek euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide.
   Method: Three areas are examined that are informative of the role of the psychiatrist in assessing patients who desire death: recent surveys of psychiatrists' attitudes, empirical and clinical studies, and treatment issues.
   Results: Demoralisation and depression emerge as pertinent clinical issues worthy of psychiatric intervention. The role of the psychiatrist is complex and includes issues of assessment, systems, countertransference and treatment.
   Conclusions: Dutch guidelines for physician-assisted suicide in the mentally ill generate serious concern given the uncertainty of prognosis, potential range and variability of outcome of treatments of suicidality and the boundary violations that are involved for the psychiatrist. The guidelines have the potential to dangerously alter the practice of psychiatry and should be condemned.

AB Introduction: The risks of suicidality (suicidal ideation or behaviour) are higher in Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) Veterans (former members) than in the Canadian general population (CGP). Suicide prevention is everyone's responsibility, but it can be difficult for many to see how they can help. This article proposes an evidence-based theoretical framework for discussing suicide prevention. The framework informed the 2017 joint CAF - Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC) suicide prevention strategy. Methods: Evidence for the framework was derived from participation in expert panels conducted by the CAF in 2009 and 2016, a review of findings from epidemiological studies of suicidality in CAF Veterans released since 1976, suicide prevention literature reviews conducted at VAC since 2009, and published theories of suicide. Results: Common to all suicide theories is the understanding that suicide causation is multifactorial, complex, and varies individually such that factors interact rather than lie along linear causal chains. Discussion: The proposed framework has three core concepts: a composite well-being framework, the life course view, and opportunities for prevention along the suicide pathway from ideation to behaviour. Evidence indicates that Veterans are influenced onto, along, and off the pathway by variable combinations of mental illness, stressful well-being problems and life events, individual factors including suicidal diathesis vulnerability, barriers to well-being supports, acquired lethal capability, imitation, impulsivity, and access to lethal means. The proposed framework can inform discussions about both whole-community participation in prevention, intervention and postvention activities at the individual and population levels, and the development of hypotheses for the increased risk of suicidality in CAF Veterans.
   LAY SUMMARY Suicide prevention is everyone's responsibility, but many wonder "What can I do?" This article proposes a practical framework that can help people and organizations to find roles for themselves. We have based the framework on expert suicide theories and research findings. The framework has three parts: a well-being framework, the life course concept, and opportunities for preventing suicides along pathways from thinking about suicide to attempting suicide.

AB Self-incineration is one of the most dramatic and lethal suicide methods. It is rarely reported in Western countries and is more frequent in developing regions. We illustrate the forensic cases of self-immolation occurring over 24 years in the city of Milan, Italy, highlighting the main issues of such a complex and rare suicide. We selected 33 cases of self-incineration among 23,417 autopsies (4022 suicides) performed at the Department of Legal Medicine of the University of Milan over a period of 24 years (1993-2016). Several parameters were included and analysed: gender and age of the victims, pathological history, previous suicide intentions/attempts, duration of burning, place of death or discovery of the corpse, circumstantial data of fatal events and autopsy findings, with particular attention to thermal injuries. Self-incineration was found in 0.8% of total suicides and 0.14% of total autopsies. One of these cases involved a complex modality (association with plastic-bag suffocation). The typical characteristics of the victim were an Italian man with psychiatric illness, frequently moved by passion, existential discomfort and economic problems. During the 24-year period, the number of cases of self-incineration progressively reduced. This study provides a general overview in one of the biggest metropolitan Italian areas and is one of the few works performed on this topic. It may be helpful in understanding and studying such an unusual manner of suicide.

   Methods. We obtained information on suicide deaths from the National Center for Health Statistics and population data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Age- and gender-specific suicide rates were computed and trends therein analyzed using linear regression techniques.
   Results. Following a period of stability or decline, suicide rates have climbed since 1988 for males aged 40-49 years, and since 1999 for females aged 40-59 years and males aged 50-59 years. A crossover in rates for 40- to 49-year-old vs. 50- to 59-year-old males and females occurred in the early 1990s, and the younger groups now have higher suicide rates. The post-1999 increase has been particularly dramatic for those who are unmarried and those without a college degree.
   Conclusions. The timing of the post-1999 increase coincides with the complete replacement of the U.S. population's middle-age strata by the postwar baby boom cohorts, whose youngest members turned 40 years of age by 2005. These cohorts, born between 1945 and 1964, also had notably high suicide rates during their adolescent years. Cohort replacement may explain the crossover in rates among the younger and older middle-aged groups. However, there is evidence for a period effect operating between 1999 and 2005, one that was apparently specific to less-protected members of the baby boom cohort.

AB Background The goal of the study was to investigate whether women use less lethal methods in committing suicide than men. A related objective was to determine whether place of committing suicide influences method of suicide.
   Method Data on all completed suicides occurring in Riverside County from 1998 to 2001 were derived from original death certificates obtained from records of the County Coroner. Descriptive statistics on method and place of suicide by sex were computed and graphically presented. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to data on 643 suicide victims to estimate the unique effects of sex and place of suicide on the three most common methods observed: firearms, hanging, and drug poisoning. Results Women were over 73% less likely to use firearms than men (OR = 0.267, CI = 0.172, 0.413). There were no sex differentials in hanging. Female victims were over 4 times more likely to die from drug poisoning than male victims (OR = 4.828, CI = 3.047, 7.650). When place of committing suicide was added to the equation, it was found that victims killing themselves at home were over 2.5 times as likely to use firearms as those dying in outdoor settings (OR = 2.501, CI = 1.078, 6.051). Persons committing suicide at home were over 3 times more likely to hang themselves than those killing themselves outdoors or on railway tracks (CI = 3.118, CI = 1.447, 6.718). Victims committing suicide at home were also 3 times as likely to use drugs as those dying outdoors or on railway tracks (OR = 3.118, CI = 1.242, 7.828). Hotel or motel suicides were 4.9 times more likely to use drug poisoning than outdoor or railway suicides (OR = 4.924, CI = 1.409, 17.206). Conclusion The proposition that women use less lethal methods of committing suicide than men was only partially supported by the data. It appears that the situation is more complex than a simple dichotomy between more lethal and less lethal methods. In past research, hanging has been considered a very lethal method. However, women were just as likely to hang themselves as men. Furthermore, firearm use was the second mode of suicide among women. The overall policy implication of this study is that suicide prevention efforts should concentrate not only on dissuading potential suicide victims, but also limiting access to firearms and promoting responsible firearm storage practices.

AB ObjectiveThe aim of this study is to systematically review published research describing the frequency, nature, and contributing factors of completed suicides among nursing home residents.
   MethodsIn accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement, this review examined all original, peer-reviewed literature published in English between 1 January 1949 and 31 December 2013 describing completed suicides among nursing home residents. Information extracted for analysis included: study and population characteristics, method of suicide, potential risk factors, and interventions.
   ResultsEight studies were identified; the majority (n=5) conducted in the United States of America. There were 113 suicides in nursing homes reported in the literature, 101 with detailed information available for aggregate analysis. The majority were male (n=62, 61.4%), aged between 61 and 93years. Suicide was most commonly by hanging (n=27, 38.0%) or falling from a height (n=27, 38.0%). Risk factors were considered in a proportion of studies. Depression was examined in 27 cases and present in 18 (67%). Duration of residence was examined in 25 cases, 13 (52%) of which had resided in the nursing home less than 12months. Physical health was examined in 22 cases, 11 (50%) of whom were experiencing physical decline. Prior suicidal behaviour, cognitive function, and personal loss were also examined. Organizational risk factors and intervention strategies were rarely considered.
   ConclusionsThere is a paucity of research describing completed suicide among nursing home residents. More large-scale research is required using standardized methods for reporting information to better understand and prevent completed suicides in this setting.

DT Article
DE behavioral health; community; expenditures; fractal; funding; mental
   health; partition; state hospital; structure; suicide rate
AB The authors, using State Mental Health Agency (SMHA) data from the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors' Research Institute, show that the amount of state hospital (SH) expenditures is related to suicide rate (SR) as well as to cost per capita for mental health care. The relationship is much stronger for cost per capita especially when the range of SH expenditures is 3155%, or 43 +/- 12%, of total expenditures. This article hypothesizes that maximum system efficiency occurs when the funding structure of the delivery system reflects a 57%:43% (community [C]/SH) ratio. This ratio was the mean for the 50 states of the United States in 1997, when the national mean SR was 13 per 100,000 of general population. This ratio is identical to the C-to-SH inpatient bed ratio derived theoretically in a previously reported study focusing on fractal (self-similar on all scales) demand for mental health services. The potential for national saving with the redistribution of funding may be as high as $4.5 billion per year, or 23% of SMHA expenditures.

AB Objective: Suicide rates in veteran and military populations in the United States are high. This article reviews studies of the accuracy of methods to identify individuals at increased risk of suicide and the effectiveness and adverse effects of health care interventions relevant to U.S. veteran and military populations in reducing suicide and suicide attempts.
   Methods: Trials, observational studies, and systematic reviews relevant to U.S. veterans and military personnel were identified in searches of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, SocINDEX, and Cochrane databases (January 1, 2008, to September 11, 2015), on Web sites, and in reference lists. Investigators extracted and confirmed data and dual-rated risk of bias for included studies.
   Results: Nineteen studies evaluated accuracy of risk assessment methods, including models using retrospective electronic records data and clinician-or patient-rated instruments. Most methods demonstrated sensitivity $ 80% or area-under-the-curve values $. 70 in single studies, including two studies based on electronic records of veterans and military personnel, but specificity varied. Suicide rates were reduced in six of eight observational studies of population-level interventions. Only two of ten trials of individual-level psychotherapy reported statistically significant differences between treatment and usual care.
   Conclusions: Risk assessment methods have been shown to be sensitive predictors of suicide and suicide attempts, but the frequency of false positives limits their clinical utility. Research to refine these methods and examine clinical applications is needed. Studies of suicide prevention interventions are inconclusive; trials of population-level interventions and promising therapies are required to support their clinical use.

AB A recent large population study of 130,000 adults in the United States failed to find evidence for a link between psychedelic use (lysergic acid diethylamide, psilocybin or mescaline) and mental health problems. Using a new data set consisting of 135,095 randomly selected United States adults, including 19,299 psychedelic users, we examine the associations between psychedelic use and mental health. After adjusting for sociodemographics, other drug use and childhood depression, we found no significant associations between lifetime use of psychedelics and increased likelihood of past year serious psychological distress, mental health treatment, suicidal thoughts, suicidal plans and suicide attempt, depression and anxiety. We failed to find evidence that psychedelic use is an independent risk factor for mental health problems. Psychedelics are not known to harm the brain or other body organs or to cause addiction or compulsive use; serious adverse events involving psychedelics are extremely rare. Overall, it is difficult to see how prohibition of psychedelics can be justified as a public health measure.

AB Rates of suicide and major depressive disorder (MDD) are currently at the highest point in the history of the United States (US). However, these rates are not distributed evenly among the population and Latinos show disproportionately high rates of both suicide and MDD. Yet, past research has infrequently explored factors related to suicide and MDD in primary care settings that serve as the major community portal for mental health among the Latino population. Thus, the current study investigated sociodemographic variables (marital status, nativity, education, employment, primary language, age, and gender) in terms of their relations with suicidal ideation, suicide risk, MDD, and MDD symptom severity among Latino primary care patients in a Federally Qualified Health Center (N = 634, M-age = 39.46, SD = 11.46, 87.1% female). Results indicated that gender and Nativity were associated with suicidal ideation, older age was associated with suicide risk, and higher education and having a partner were negatively associated with MDD and depressive symptom severity. These results provide novel insight into the role of sociodemographic factors predicting suicide and MDD among Latinos in primary care, and suggest greater scientific and clinical attention can be focused on certain sociodemographic factors to offset mental health disparities among this group.

AB Background: Urban-rural disparities in suicide mortality have received considerable attention. Varying conceptualizations of urbanity may contribute to the conflicting findings. This ecological study on Germany assessed how and to what extent urban-rural suicide associations are affected by 14 different urban-rural indicators.
   Methods: Indicators were based on continuous or k-means classified population data, land-use data, planning typologies, or represented population-based accessibility indicators. Agreements between indicators were tested with correlation analyses. Spatial Bayesian Poisson regressions were estimated to examine urban-rural suicide associations while adjusting for risk and protective factors.
   Results: Urban-rural differences in suicide rates per 100,000 persons were found irrespective of the indicator. Strong and significant correlation was observed between different urban-rural indicators. Although the effect sign consistently referred to a reduced risk in urban areas, statistical significance was not universally confirmed by all regressions. Goodness-of-fit statistics suggested that the population potential score performs best, and that population density is the second best indicator of urbanicity. Numerical indicators are favored over classified ones. Regional planning typologies are not supported.
   Conclusions: The strength of suicide urban-rural associations varies with respect to the applied indicator of urbanicity. Future studies that put urban-rural inequalities central are recommended to apply either unclassified population potentials or population density indicators, but sensitivity analyses are advised.

AB Adolescence, when suicidal ideation and behaviors often begin, might offer an important window to understand the causes and prevent the progression of suicide phenomena. The need for frameworks to organize the fragmented field has been noted, but few studies are theoretically driven. An important recent contribution to understanding suicidality is Joiner's (2005) Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide (IPTS). This article reviews the evidence for the applicability of the IPTS in adolescence. Seventeen studies of adolescents that specifically tested or interpreted findings in the light of Joiner's theory or the IPTS were located. In addition, several recent reviews of the literature on suicidality in adolescence covered information relevant to the IPTS. There is some support for the theory in adolescence, particularly with regard to its most novel component, the association between acquired capability and suicide attempt. In summary, we find this theory to be a promising heuristic to organize the disparate studies in suicide research. Future challenges and directions for researchers seeking to test and elaborate the applicability of the IPTS in adolescence include: adaptations of instruments to the developmental stage, capturing of imminent risk, and consideration of whether the current model is underspecified. Age might moderate adult findings that give impulsivity an indirect role in suicide attempts.

AB Research on the effect of suicide stories in the media on suicide in the real world has been marked by much debate and inconsistent findings. Recent narrative reviews have suggested that research based on nonfictional models is more apt to uncover imitative effects than research based on fictional models. There is, however, substantial variation in media effects within the research restricted to nonfictional accounts of suicide. The present analysis provides some explanations of the variation in findings in the work on nonfictional media. Logistic regression techniques applied to 419 findings from 55 studies determined that: (1) studies measuring the presence of either an entertainment or political celebrity were 5.27 times more likely to find a copycat effect, (2) studies focusing on stories that stressed negative definitions of suicide were 99% less likely to report a copycat effect, (3) research based on television stories (which receive less coverage than print stories) were 79% less likely to find a copycat effect, and (4) studies focusing on female suicide were 4.89 times more likely to report a copycat effect than other studies. The full logistic regression model correctly classified 77.3% of the findings from the 55 studies. Methodological differences among studies are associated with discrepancies in their results.

AB Objective: Suicide remains a serious health problem in the United States and worldwide. Despite changing distributions in sex, race-ethnicity, and age and considerable efforts to reduce the incidence rate, the number of suicides has remained relatively stable. The transition from emergency services to outpatient services is a crucial but often neglected step in treating suicidal individuals. Up to 50% of attempters refuse recommended treatment, and up to 60% drop out after only one session. This point of intervention is crucial for patients at elevated risk of suicide to reduce imminent danger and to increase the chances that patients will follow up on recommended treatment. Methods: PubMed, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO databases were searched for empirical investigations of treatment engagement of suicide attempters. Keywords searched included treatment, intervention, engagement, adherence, compliance, utilization, participation, and suicide attempt. Mapped terms were also included. Thirteen articles were selected. Results: Studies that have examined the effectiveness of postdischarge contact with suicide attempters (phone, letter, and in-person visits) to increase treatment adherence have found some immediate effects after substantial contact that were not sustained. Simple referrals to outpatient care were not effective. Family group interventions for adolescents have improved adherence, as have brief interventions in the emergency department. Conclusions: Despite greater public awareness of suicide, heightened prevention effort, and increased efficacy of treatment interventions, success in reducing suicidal behavior has been limited. Developing brief interventions for use in emergency settings that can reduce suicide risk and enhance treatment follow-up has been a neglected aspect of suicide prevention and may help to reduce suicidal behavior.

AB Little is known about the cause-specific deaths among young suicide attempters from the general population, and the time window for intervention to reduce the elevated rate of death was unclear. We analyzed a nationally representative sample of young adults (17-39 years old) who participated in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988-1994) and were followed up with vital status through December 31, 2006. The history of attempted suicide was associated with an increased rate for all-cause death (HR=1.52 [95% CI=0.92-2.52]) with borderline statistical significance. Previous suicide attempters experienced a 3-fold (HR=2.68[=1.01-7.09]) increased rate for cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and a 7-fold (HR=7.10 [95% CI=1.37-36.9]) increased rate of death due to completed suicide compared with non-attempters. The survival curves of the attempters declined rapidly for the first 3 years of follow-up, and the distance between curves remained consistent starting from the third year to the end of the follow-up. Prevention services should be tailored not only for suicide, but also for cardiovascular diseases among populations with suicidal tendency, and the service should be intensified within first 3 years after suicidal behaviors occur.

AB The purpose of the present study was to analyze the factor structure of the Tolerance for Mental Pain Scale (TMPS) in a sample of United States adults and examine its associations with suicidal behavior and intensity of psychological pain. Data were collected through an online general population survey (N = 225), and statistical analysis consisted of factor analysis and descriptive statistics of the data. Confirmatory factor analysis did not indicate a good fit with the originally proposed three-factor model. Subsequent exploratory factor analysis showed a good fit for a two-factor solution while enabling reduction of the scale to ten items, which we refer to as TMPS-10. The TMPS-10 scores were significantly lower for respondents with a lifetime history of attempted suicide and significantly inversely associated with the intensity of psychological pain. We recommend using the TMPS-10 to assess tolerance for mental pain for research purposes. With half the number of items of the original scale, the TMPS-10 has a lower response burden and minimizes the risk of over-inflating internal consistency due to redundant items.

AB Thompson PM, Cruz DA, Olukotun DY, Delgado PL. Serotonin receptor, SERT mRNA and correlations with symptoms in males with alcohol dependence and suicide. Objective: This study tested the hypothesis that abnormalities in components of the serotonin (5HT) system in the prefrontal cortex are associated with suicide in alcohol-dependent subjects. Second, we assessed the relationship of lifetime impulsivity and mood symptoms with prefrontal cortex 5-HT measures. Method: Tissue was obtained from Brodmanns areas (BA) 9 and 24 in postmortem samples of individuals who were alcohol dependent with suicide (n = 5), alcohol dependent without suicide (n = 9) and normal controls (n = 5). Serotonin receptor (5HT) and serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) mRNA were measured. Interviews with next of kin estimated lifetime impulsivity and mood symptoms in the last week of life. Results: Serotonin receptor 1A (5HT1A) mRNA in BA 9 was elevated in the alcohol dependence without suicide group compared with controls. In the alcohol dependence with suicide group, anxiety symptoms were associated with decreased BA 24 SERT mRNA and depressive symptoms with BA 9 5HT1A mRNA expression. In the alcohol dependent only group impulsivity is correlated with increased BA 9, and BA 24 serotonin receptor 2A mRNA. Conclusion: Our data suggest region-specific change, rather than global serotonin blunting is involved in alcohol dependence and suicide. It also suggests that symptoms are differentially influenced by prefrontal cortex serotonin receptor mRNA levels.

AB The purpose of the present study was to evaluate posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related hospitalizations in the United States (2002-2011). Over this period, there were an estimated 1,477,944 hospitalizations (915,591 women) with either a primary (reason for hospitalization) or secondary PTSD diagnosis. Population-based hospitalization rates rose from 2002 to 2011; women in the age range of 20 to 44 years had the highest rates and the steepest rise. Most of the hospitalizations for men and women younger than 45 years had been assigned a primary diagnosis of mental illness (including PTSD). Mood and substance use disorders were among the most commonly co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses with PTSD. Suicidal ideation/suicide attempts declined with increasing age. The strongest predictor of this criterion was mood disorder, and its importance as a predictor increased as people aged. Total inflation-adjusted charges for all PTSD-related hospitalizations were $34.9 billion, with 36% being for hospitalizations where a mental illness (including PTSD) was the primary diagnosis.

AB Objective: Suicide ideation (SI) and suicide plan (SP) can be seen as immediate precursors of suicide. The major aim of this study is to estimate the severity of SI and SP among LBC, and explore their associated factors.
   Method: A population-based random sampling survey of 2898 LBC was performed. Self-developed structured questionnaire was used to collect relevant information. The prevalence of one-week and lifetime SI and SP was estimated, univariate and multivariate logistic regression model were used to analyze the associated factors of SI in LBC, as well as the associated factors of SP in LBC who reported SI.
   Results: For surveyed LBC, the one-week prevalence rates of SI and SP were 6.76% (95%CI: 5.30-8.00%) and 2.31% (95%CI: 1.80-2.93%), the lifetime prevalence rates of SI and SP were 20.8% (95%CI: 17.2-25.0%) and 7.69% (95%CI: 4.84-11.0%). Girls reported higher prevalence of SI, while SP severity showed insignificant gender difference. Sex, grade, SH behaviors, depression and psychological resilience were consistently associated with both one-week and lifetime SI. Age and depression were prominent influencing factors of SP in one-week suicide ideators, grade, self-harm history, depression, mother's education level were associated factors of SP in lifetime suicide ideators.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of SI and SA in Chinese LBC is high. Girls, junior high school students, self-harmed, depressed, less psychologically resilient individuals were observed increased prevalence of SI, depression may play a significant role in facilitating the transition from SI to SP.

   DISSOCIATION
AB Objective: Perform a meta-analysis to quantify the association between psychological pain and current or lifetime history of suicidal ideation or suicide attempt.
   Data Sources: Search MEDLINE, Web of Science, and PsycINFO from 1965 to 2015 for (psychache OR mental pain OR psychological pain) AND (suicid*).
   Study Selection: Observational case-control studies addressing the difference in psychological pain between individuals with and without current or lifetime history of suicidal ideation or suicide attempt.
   Data Extraction: Data were independently extracted into a standard electronic form. All authors were contacted for unpublished data related to current or lifetime history of suicide ideation or attempt.
   Data Synthesis: Twenty studies were included. Comparisons concerned 760 subjects with versus 8,803 subjects without lifetime history of suicide attempt; 344 subjects with versus 357 patients without current suicide attempt; 262 patients with versus 64 patients without lifetime history of suicidal ideation; and 551 subjects with versus 7,383 subjects without current suicidal ideation. The intensity of psychological pain was higher (1) in both subjects with lifetime history of suicide attempts and subjects with current suicide attempts versus without (effect sizes= 0.72, P< 10(-2) and 0.66, P< 10(-2), respectively) and (2) in both subjects with lifetime history of suicide ideation and subjects with current suicidal ideation versus without (effect sizes= 1.49, P = .01 and 1.15, P< 10(-2), respectively). Association between psychological pain and suicidality remained significant even when depression levels were not different between subjects.
   Conclusions: Higher psychological pain levels are associated with suicidal ideation and acts. Considering psychological pain to be at the core of suicidality is important for daily clinical practice and for the promotion of innovative therapeutic strategies for suicide prevention.

TI Suicides and deaths of undetermined intent among veterinary
   professionals from 2003 through 2014
SO JAVMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; RISK; PHYSICIANS; RATES
AB OBJECTIVE
   To analyze data for death of veterinary professionals and veterinary students, with manner of death characterized as suicide or undetermined intent from 2003 through 2014.
   SAMPLE
   Death records for 202 veterinary professionals and veterinary students.
   PROCEDURES
   Decedents employed as veterinarians, veterinary technicians or technologists, or veterinary assistants or laboratory animal caretakers and veterinary students who died by suicide or of undetermined intent were identified through retrospective review of National Violent Death Reporting System records. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated, and mechanisms and circumstances of death were compared among veterinary occupational groups.
   RESULTS
   197 veterinary professionals and 5 veterinary students had deaths by suicide or of undetermined intent. Among decedents employed at the time of death, SMRs for suicide of male and female veterinarians (1.6 and 2.4, respectively) and male and female veterinary technicians or technologists (5.0 and 2.3, respectively) were significantly greater than those for the general US population, whereas SMRs for suicide of male and female veterinary assistants or laboratory animal caretakers were not. Poisoning was the most common mechanism of death among veterinarians; the drug most commonly used was pentobarbital. For most (13/18) veterinarians who died of pentobarbital poisoning, the death-related injury occurred at home. When decedents with pentobarbital poisoning were excluded from analyses, SMRs for suicide of male and female veterinarians, but not veterinary technicians or technologists, did not differ significantly from results for the general population.
   CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE
   Results suggested higher SMRs for suicide among veterinarians might be attributable to pentobarbital access. Improving administrative controls for pentobarbital might be a promising suicide prevention strategy among veterinarians; however, different strategies are likely needed for veterinary technicians or technologists.

AB Aims: This study aimed to determine the role of acute alcohol use among suicide decedents based on their blood alcohol concentrations (BAC), and identify sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with the differences in BAC.
   Methods: Data were collected from nationwide autopsies conducted between May 2015 and November 2015 in South Korea. A total of 683 suicide decedents were classified into three groups according to the BAC at the time of autopsy: no alcohol (NA) group (BAC < 0.01%), no intoxication (NI) group (0.01 <= BAC < 0.08%), and intoxication (I) group (BAC >= 0.08%). Sociodemographic data and clinical factors related to suicide among the three groups were analyzed using a multinomial logistic regression analysis.
   Results: Among the suicide decedents (N = 683), the NA group was 55.6% (N = 380), NI group was 15.7% (N = 107), and I group was 28.7% (N = 196). History of suicide attempts (odds ratio [OR]: 1.798, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.073-3.012) and absence of medical illness (OR: 1.633, CI: 1.038-2.571) were higher in the I group compared to the NA group. Psychiatric and medical illness triggers of suicide were significantly lower in the I group than the NA group (OR: 0.325, CI: 0.118-0.892). Being male (OR: 2.494, CI: 1.363-4.565) and financial problems as triggers of suicide (OR: 3.234, CI: 1.636-6.393) were higher in the NI group than in the NA group. Being male and having financial problems were associated with no intoxication (0.01 <= BAC < 0.08%), whereas the history of suicide attempts and absence of medical and/or psychiatric illness were associated with acute alcohol intoxication (BAC >= 0.08%) in the suicide decedents.
   Conclusions: Suicide decedents had different characteristics based on different BACs identified in the autopsy. The differences in acute alcohol intoxication and no intoxication in suicide decedents may have implications for the targeted prevention of suicides related to alcohol.

AB Maternal mortality continues to be a public health priority in national and international communities. Maternal death rates secondary to medical illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, preeclampsia, and postpartum hemorrhage are well documented. The rates of maternal death secondary to self-harm, including suicide and overdose, have been omitted from published rates of maternal mortality, despite growing attention to the prevalence of perinatal mood disorders, estimated at up to 15% of pregnant and postpartum women in the United States. Underlying psychiatric disorder, including depression, is consistently identified as a risk factor in substance abuse and suicide. The rate of opioid-associated morbidity and mortality has recently been deemed a national crisis. Pregnancy does not protect against these risks, and the postpartum period has been identified as a particularly vulnerable time. The lack of consistent and inclusive data on self-harm deaths in the pregnancy-postpartum period is alarming. This review will identify barriers to reporting and ascertainment of maternal suicide and overdose deaths, summarize geographic-specific data available, address potential social and psychological biases that have led to neglect of the topic of maternal self-harm deaths, and suggest recommendations that incorporate the whole woman in prenatal care and thus prevention of this devastating outcome.

   DISPARITIES
AB Gay and bisexual men experience numerous health disparities relative to heterosexual men, including high rates of HIV and suicidal behavior. Systematic community health assessments could provide direct comparisons of the burden of mortality across diseases and thus facilitate the prioritization of public health activities; however, such assessments have been precluded by the absence of sexual orientation information in vital statistics records. In this context, we used population attributable fraction to derive and compare indirect estimates of mortality for both HIV and suicide. Assuming that 2% of Canadian men are gay or bisexual, and that these men are 42 times more likely to die from HIV and 4 times more likely to die from suicide, we estimated that in 2011, suicide resulted in 46 deaths per 100,000 gay and bisexual men, while HIV resulted in 30 deaths per 100,000. Based on these estimates, suicide surpassed HIV as a leading cause of premature mortality for gay and bisexual men in 2007. Despite the large burden of suicide among gay and bisexual men, research attending to the issue in biomedical, psychology, and social science literatures is sparse, with at least 10 times fewer citations than for HIV between 2003 and 2012. We urge researchers, practitioners, and community leaders to broaden the scope of gay and bisexual men's public health priorities to include suicide and other high burden health inequities.

AB This study compares youth (<24 years) suicide rates in Turkey and the United States; a demographic and cross-cultural comparison and exploration of possible causative factors. Publicly available data were compared for children, adolescents, and young adults for years 1992-2004. The mean general population suicide rate in Turkey (per 100,000) was, male = 3.53 and female = 2.31 (for the US, males = 18.37, females = 4.31); for ages below 15 years the rate was, males = 0.28 and females = 0.39 (for the US, males = 1.09 and females = 0.38); while for aged 15-24 years the rate was, males = 4.58 and females = 5.22 (for the US, males = 18.84 and females = 3.36).
   The patterns for Turkey are: (a) Female youth had a higher suicide rate than male youth; this was the reverse of the U. S. pattern, (b) Youth suicide increased during the time period in Turkey, whereas it was relatively stable in the US, (c) However, suicide rates in Turkey were generally lower than the US, (d) Fifty percent of all female suicide victims in Turkey were under the age of 24 years (versus 11% in the US).
   Possible psychosocial causative factors may include (a) negative social status of females (forced marriage, young marriage age, low literacy, honor killings); (b) substantial rural to urban migration which disrupts ties and exposes migrants to a less traditional cultural system; (c) shortage of mental health services; (d) and possibly, reduced religious education enrollment may be an additional factor.

AB Background: Preliminary evidence suggests military sexual trauma (MST) may be associated with increased risk for suicidal behaviors among active duty military personnel and veterans. Among National Guard personnel, a high-risk subgroup, MST and suicide risk have not received much empirical attention.
   Purpose: To examine the association of MST with suicide ideation and suicide attempts among National Guard personnel.
   Procedures: N = 997 National Guard personnel from Idaho and Utah participated in an anonymous online survey. Weighted analyses were conducted to minimize sampling bias.
   Main findings: 9% of participants had a history of MST (6% of men, 28% of women). Among participants reporting MST, 68% reported a service member perpetrator and 44% reported a civilian perpetrator (12% reported both). A history of MST was associated with significantly increased risk for lifetime suicide attempt. MST remained a significant predictor of lifetime suicide attempt even when restricting the sample to the subgroup with a history of suicidal thoughts (n = 257,27% of full sample). When adjusting for premilitary sexual victimization, MST was no longer significantly associated with lifetime suicide attempts, but premilitary sexual victimization was.
   Conclusions: The rate of MST among National Guard personnel is comparable to rates among active duty military personnel, although the perpetrators of MST are less likely to be service members. MST is a risk factor for suicide attempts, but premilitary sexual victimization is a relatively stronger risk factor. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background. - Suicide is a complex and multifactorial phenomenon. The number of work-related suicides is difficult to assess in France. There are nevertheless some data available to document this problem. The aim of this study is to describe suicide attempts (SA) and suicide mortality according to occupation in France.
   Methods. - The description of SA relies on the "Barometre Sante 2005", a cross-sectional representative survey conducted by the tripes in France. The study population includes 6264 men and 7389 women in employment at the time of the survey. The prevalence of all life SA is described according to occupational category (one and two digits). Data on suicide mortality before the age of 65 comes from the Cosmop project, conducted by the Department of Occupational Health/InVS, and based on data from the "Echantillon demographique permanent"/Insee linked to medical causes of death from the French national death registry (CepiDc/Inserm). People included was born in France, employed at one of censuses (1968, 1975, 1982 and 1990, 187,938 men, 150,683 women). Relative risks for suicide mortality were estimated for the last known occupational category and economic sector.
   Results. - The prevalence of life course SA was higher among women than among men (6.6% vs 3.1%); an opposite situation was observed for mortality. Regarding, salaried people, categories of manual workers and clerks are the most affected by SA and mortality from suicide whereas executives are the least concerned. Farmers were little affected by SA (0.4% men, 4.1% women) but experienced the highest rate of mortality by suicide (RR = 3.1 men, RR = 2.2 women). Among women, compared to non market sectors, the agricultural and equipment goods sectors exhibited an excessive risk of mortality from suicide.
   Conclusion. - This study points out SA and mortality from suicide inequalities by occupational categories and to a lesser extent by economic sector. These results provide a first assessment on suicide according to occupation in France. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

ID UNITED-STATES; RISK-FACTORS; DEATH
AB Background: Marital status is one of the most frequently replicated predictors of suicide. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of marital status on the risk of suicide by gender, using a large population-based cohort in Japan.
   Methods: The Miyagi cohort study was a population-based, prospective cohort study of Japanese adults aged between 40 and 64 years. Between June and August 1990, 47,604 participants residing in 14 municipalities of Miyagi Prefecture, Japan, completed a questionnaire on various health-related lifestyles, including marital status. During 18 years of follow-up, 146 of the participants committed suicide. We used the Cox proportional hazards regression model to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for suicide mortality according to marital status with adjustment for potential confounders.
   Results: A total of 106 and 40 deaths from suicide were recorded during 344,813 and 365,524 person-years of follow-up among 20,671 men and 21,076 women, respectively. We found that marital status was significantly associated with the risk of completing suicide only in men. Among men, after multivariate adjustment, HRs in reference to married were as follows: widowed or divorced, 2.84 (95% CI: 1.37-5.90); unmarried, 1.56 (95% CI: 0.67-3.64). A significantly increased risk of suicidal death was observed among widowed or divorced men, whereas no such trend was evident for women.
   Conclusions.: Our results suggest that men who are widowed or divorced, or unmarried, are at increased risk of suicide, whereas no such risk is evident for women. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   VIOLENT DEATH; MORTALITY; IDEATION; BEHAVIOR; ALCOHOL; YOUTH
AB Objective: The study examined whether chronic exposure to nicotine is independently associated with suicide.
   Methods: Data from the 1993 National Mortality Followback Survey in the United States were analyzed by using a case-control design. Data for 989 suicide decedents were compared with data for 3,125 accident and homicide decedents. Inclusion criteria were ever smoking 100 cigarettes and white or black race. The exclusion criterion was death from natural or undetermined causes. Three smoking parameters were compared: lifetime smoking duration, ever quitting, and abstinence duration. Covariates were the manner of death, which was derived from coroners' death certificates, and data pertaining to the last year of life, which was reported by next of kin, on depressive symptoms, alcohol and drug use, veteran status, having a firearm in the home, and living alone.
   Results: In multivariate, fully adjusted analyses, longer lifetime smoking (>= 41 versus <= 10 years) was associated with higher odds of suicide (odds ratio [OR]=2.26, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.30-3.93). Quitting smoking was associated with lower odds of suicide (OR=.37, CI=.25-.55), as was longer abstinence duration (>= 11 versus,5 years) (OR=.33, CI=.21-.52). These associations were observed only among males.
   Conclusions: Findings indicated a probable independent association between suicide and current smoking and longer lifetime smoking duration. The findings are additional grounds to investigate smoking as a possible independent cause of suicide.

DT Editorial Material
ID AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE; COHORT; DIE
AB Currently, 1 of every 6 Americans resides in a state where physician-assisted suicide/hastened death is legal, a denominator that appears to be shrinking.(1) In 2015, fully half of state legislatures considered legalization of hastened death practices.(1) These statistics are particularly relevant to neurologists who care for patients afflicted with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Hastened death interest among patients with ALS has been repeatedly reported both in the United States and in Western Europe, exceeding that of patients with other terminal illnesses by 2- to 10-fold.(2-4) Among physicians who care for patients with ALS, a substantial majority of surveyed American Academy of Neurology members residing in lawful physician assisted suicide jurisdictions endorse the concept that hastened death is an ethically permissible action in terminally ill patients (J.A. Russell for the Ethics, Law and Humanities Committee [a joint committee of the American Academy of Neurology, American Neurological Association, and Child Neurology Society], unpublished survey, 2014). It is plausible, however, that the conscience of those physicians who might otherwise morally endorse hastened death, and who might accede to the request of their dying patients by their own participation, could waver with the knowledge that their patient's judgment and decision-making capacity were adversely influenced by their disease.

AB Objectives. We examined the relationship between levels of household firearm ownership, as measured directly and by a proxy-the percentage of suicides committed with a firearm-and age-adjusted firearm homicide rates at the state level.
   Methods. We conducted a negative binomial regression analysis of panel data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Web-Based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting Systems database on gun ownership and firearm homicide rates across all 50 states during 1981 to 2010. We determined fixed effects for year, accounted for clustering within states with generalized estimating equations, and controlled for potential state-level confounders.
   Results. Gun ownership was a significant predictor of firearm homicide rates (incidence rate ratio = 1.009; 95% confidence interval = 1.004, 1.014). This model indicated that for each percentage point increase in gun ownership, the firearm homicide rate increased by 0.9%.
   Conclusions. We observed a robust correlation between higher levels of gun ownership and higher firearm homicide rates. Although we could not determine causation, we found that states with higher rates of gun ownership had disproportionately large numbers of deaths from firearm-related homicides.

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SEXUAL-ABUSE; RISK; DELINQUENT; PREVALENCE
AB Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of multiple adverse life experiences (sexual abuse, homelessness, running away, and substance abuse in the family) on suicide ideation and suicide attempt among adolescents at an urban juvenile detention facility in the United States.
   Materials and Methods: The study sample included a total of 3,156 adolescents processed at a juvenile detention facility in an urban area in Ohio between 2003 and 2007. The participants, interacting anonymously with a voice enabled computer, self-administered a questionnaire with 100 items related to health risk behaviors.
   Results: Overall 19.0% reported ever having thought about suicide (suicide ideation) and 11.9% reported ever having attempted suicide (suicide attempt). In the multivariable logistic regression analysis those reporting sexual abuse (Odds Ratio = 2.75; 95% confidence interval = 2.08-3.63) and homelessness (1.51; 1.17-1.94) were associated with increased odds of suicide ideation, while sexual abuse (3.01; 2.22-4.08), homelessness (1.49; 1.12-1.98), and running away from home (1.38; 1.06-1.81) were associated with increased odds of a suicide attempt. Those experiencing all four adverse events were 7.81 times more likely (2.41-25.37) to report having ever attempted suicide than those who experienced none of the adverse events.
   Conclusions: Considering the high prevalence of adverse life experiences and their association with suicidal behaviors in detained adolescents, these factors should not only be included in the suicide screening tools at the intake and during detention, but should also be used for the intervention programming for suicide prevention.

AB Objectives. To examine the extent to which law enforcement agencies (LEAs) and gun retailers are willing to offer voluntary, temporary storage as a part of an overall suicide prevention effort.
   Methods. We invited all LEAs and gun retailers in 8 US states to respond to questionnaires asking about their willingness to offer temporary gun storage and their recommendations to gun owners about safe storage.
   Results. We collected data in 2016 from 448 LEAs and 95 retailers (response rates of 53% and 25%, respectively). Three quarters of LEAs (74.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 72.1, 77.5) indicated they already provided temporary storage compared with 47.6% (95% CI = 39.2, 56.0) of retailers. LEAs were most willing to provide storage when a gun owner was concerned about the mental health of a family member. Retailers were more receptive than were LEAs to providing storage when visitors were coming or for people wanting storage while traveling. Both groups recommended locking devices within the home, but LEAs were slightly more favorable to storing guns away from the home.
   Conclusions. Law enforcement agencies and gun retailers are important resources for families concerned about suicide.

   HANDGUN; CRIME; ASSOCIATION; AGGRESSION; HOME
AB There are two conflicting positions toward gun ownership in the United States. Proponents of stricter gun control argue that guns are responsible for 32,000 gun-related deaths each year and that the introduction of stricter gun control laws would reduce this death toll. Gun rights advocates argue that the general availability of guns reduces homicide rates, due to deterrence and because guns are effective means of self-defense. Based on a review of the evidence, I draw the following conclusions: Gun prevalence is positively related to homicide rates. There is no evidence for a protective effect of gun ownership. In fact, gun owners have a greater likelihood of being murdered. Furthermore, gun ownership is associated with an increased risk of serious injuries, accidental death, and death from suicide. The evidence on the effectiveness of gun control measures has not been encouraging, partly because the influential gun lobby has successfully prevented the introduction of more effective measures. A federal registration system for all firearms would address many limitations of present gun control measures. To mobilize public opinion, a culture change in attitudes toward firearms is needed.

AB Purpose: Mortality rates in the U. S. Army from 2005 to 2011 were examined over time and compared to the U. S. general population. Method: Cases were U. S. Army Soldiers (active duty or activated National Guard/Reserve) with dates of death between 2005 and 2011 and between 18 and 64 years of age in the Department of Defense Medical Mortality Registry. Age-and sex-adjusted annual mortality rates (AR) were calculated for each category of death and examined via linear regression. Proportions of underlying causes of death were also examined. Results: The trend in AR in the U. S. Army significantly decreased for combat deaths, the average annual percent change (AAPC) = 15.2% decrease in the log of the rate (LAR); p = 0.04 and accident deaths, AAPC = 5.4% decrease in the LAR; p = 0.002 and significantly increased for suicides, AAPC = 10.6% increase in the LAR; p = 0.001. The trend in AR for suicides for the Army was significantly different compared to the U. S. general population, AAPC = 11.0% increase in the LAR; p < 0.001. Conclusions: Trends in rates of combat deaths and accident deaths declined although rates of suicides increased. The Army suicide rate increased in comparison to the United States. 70% of accident deaths were transportation related. Almost 70% of suicides and homicides were firearm related.

   DEPRESSION; RECOVERY PROCESS; SUBSTANCE USE; ILLNESS; RISK; HOPELESSNESS
AB Objective: Suicide is a devastating public health problem, and research indicates that people with prior attempts are at the greatest risk of completing suicide, followed by persons with depression and other major mental and substance use conditions. Because there has been little direct input from individuals with serious mental illness and a history of suicidal behavior concerning suicide prevention efforts, this study examined how this population copes with suicidal thoughts. Methods: Participants in 14 regional consumer-run Hope Dialogues in New York State (N = 198) wrote up to five strategies they use to deal with suicidal thoughts. Strategies were classified according to grounded theory. Results: First responses included spirituality, talking to someone, positive thinking, using the mental health system, considering consequences of suicide to family and friends, using peer supports, and doing something pleasurable. Although a majority reported that more formal therapeutic supports were available, only 12% indicated that they considered the mental health system a frontline strategy. Instead, respondents more frequently relied on family, friends, peers, and faith as sources of hope and support. Conclusions: Consumers' reliance on formal therapeutic supports and support from peers and family suggests that education and support for dealing with individuals in despair and crisis should be targeted to the social networks of this high-risk population. The disparity between availability of formal mental health services and reliance on them when consumers are suicidal suggests that suicide prevention efforts should evaluate whether they are effectively engaging high-risk populations as they struggle to cope with despair.

AB Background: Although the link between drug abuse and suicide risk is established, few studies have examined the relationship between the nonmedical use of prescription drugs (NMUPD) and suicide risk, particularly among adolescents. Objectives: To explore the relationship between NMUPD and suicide risk among 4,148 adolescents in grades 9-12 enrolled in five public high schools. Methods: Logistic regression models were constructed for the nonmedical use of prescription pain relievers, depressants, stimulants, and a composite measure for any NMUPD. Models were estimated before and after controlling for key covariates. Results: About 21% of respondents reported lifetime NMUPD. After covariate adjustment, students who had reported any NMUPD were between 1.7 and 2.3times more likely to report suicidal ideation, but not a suicide attempt (p < .0001). When stratified by sex and drug, nonmedical use of pain relievers, stimulants, and depressants were significantly associated with greater odds of suicidal ideation and behavior for both males and females (p < .05). However, NMUPD of pain relievers were not associated with greater odds of suicide attempts for males or females or among males who reported nonmedical use of stimulants. Nonmedical use of depressants was associated with greater odds of suicide attempts for both males and females (OR = 1.61 and 2.25, respectively) and among females who reported nonmedical use of stimulants (OR = 2.06, p < .01). Conclusions/Importance: Results suggest that some adolescents may be inappropriately self-medicating psychological distress with prescription medications or NMUPD may promote suicide risk, especially for males and females who use depressants and females who use stimulants.

AB Suicidal behavior is a leading cause of injury and death worldwide. Information about the epidemiology of such behavior is important for policy-making and prevention. The authors reviewed government data on suicide and suicidal behavior and conducted a systematic review of studies on the epidemiology of suicide published from 1997 to 2007. The authors' aims were to examine the prevalence of, trends in, and risk and protective factors for suicidal behavior in the United States and cross-nationally. The data revealed significant cross-national variability in the prevalence of suicidal behavior but consistency in age of onset, transition probabilities, and key risk factors. Suicide is more prevalent among men, whereas nonfatal suicidal behaviors are more prevalent among women and persons who are young, are unmarried, or have a psychiatric disorder. Despite an increase in the treatment of suicidal persons over the past decade, incidence rates of suicidal behavior have remained largely unchanged. Most epidemiologic research on suicidal behavior has focused on patterns and correlates of prevalence. The next generation of studies must examine synergistic effects among modifiable risk and protective factors. New studies must incorporate recent advances in survey methods and clinical assessment. Results should be used in ongoing efforts to decrease the significant loss of life caused by suicidal behavior.

AB Background: Prior reports have indicated a potential dose response relationship between smoking and suicide. However, this relationship is controversial.
   Methods: This study evaluated the association between smoking and risk of death from suicide in three large-scale cohorts of US, men and women (n=253,033). Suicides were identified from death certificates among 43,816 men enrolled in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) between 1986 and 2008, 116,566 women in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) between 1976 and 2008, and 92,651 women in the NHS II between 1989 and 2007. Information on smoking was obtained at baseline and updated every 2 years. Relative risks (RRs) of suicide were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Cohort specific RRs were pooled using random effects models. Suicide deaths were determined by physician review of death certificates.
   Results: A total of 457 deaths from suicide were documented. Compared to never smokers, the pooled multivariate RR (95% confidence interval [CI]) of suicide was 1.15 (0.91-1.45) for former smokers and 2.69 (2.11-3.42) for current smokers. A nonmonotonic dose-response relationship was noted between the number of cigarettes smoked per day (CPU) and suicide risk (P-trer,d <0001) Compared to never smokers, the pooled multivariate RR (95% Cl) was 2.59 (1.77-3.79) for those with 1-14 CPU, 2.03 (1.39-2.94) for those with 15-24 CPU, and 4.13 (2.96-5.78) for those with >25 CPU. Limitations: Smoking was self-reported and had some degree of measurement error. Participants were not a representative sample of the US. population.
   Conclusions: Results from three large cohorts suggest a nonmonotonic dose-response association between smoking and suicide risk. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved

AB Background/purpose: Suicide is a major concern in public health worldwide. Early identification of individuals at risk is critical for suicide prevention. The present study revised the 5-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5) to a checklist format (BSRS-5R) and validated the BSRS-5R into a screening tool for psychiatric morbidity and suicide ideation in the general public.
   Methods: The study participants consisted of two subsets of sample from community residents and psychiatric patients. The community subjects were recruited from stratified proportional randomization sampling in a nationwide community survey, while the psychiatric patients were from psychiatric outpatient service and psychiatric daycare unit in a teaching hospital in northern Taiwan. All participants responded to the questionnaire investigating the BSRS-5, personal experience with suicide, and demographic information.
   Results: In total, 2147 community respondents and 700 respondents from psychiatric settings completed the survey questions. The BSRS-5R was highly correlated to BSRS-5 with good internal consistency in our study sample. For the community subjects, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed an optimal cutoff of 2/3 for BSRS-5R to discriminate psychiatric morbidity or suicide ideation. The BSRS-5R could also identify psychiatric morbidity in psychiatric outpatients and daycare patients. In addition, the cutoff of 4/5 for BSRS-5R to determine suicide ideation yielded moderately good predictive validity in psychiatric outpatients and in daycare patients.
   Conclusion: The BSRS-5R was validated as an efficient checklist to screen for psychiatric morbidity and suicide ideation in the general public. The result is valuable in translating into general medical and community settings for early detection of suicide ideation. Copyright (C) 2015, Formosan Medical Association.

AB Background: Suicide rates in Hungary are notoriously high. According to the literature, marital and educational status are associated with suicidal behaviour and these associations are somewhat influenced by gender. Since in Hungary these associations have not yet been investigated by means of large-scale multivariate epidemiological studies we aimed to investigate these in the current paper.
   Method: Census data on marital and educational status, age and gender from 1980, 1990, 2001 and 2011 were used for the general population. Corresponding data from the same years for suicide victims derived from the Hungarian Demographic Register. Suicide victims younger than 20 years were excluded. Negative binomial regression analyses were used to reveal the effects of the above variables on suicide. All statistical procedures were conducted using Stata 12 software (StataCorp. 2011).
   Results: Female gender, young age, higher educational attainment and marriage were significantly associated with decreased risks of suicide. Intriguingly, effects of educational and marital status on suicide were stronger in males.
   Limitations: Data on the length of the periods between changes in marital status and suicides were unavailable. Our four categories are not suitable to cover the whole gamut of marital statuses in a modern society (e.g. we did not have a specific category for people living in cohabitation). Ecological study design.
   Conclusion: We found that in Hungary between 1980 and 2011 the effects of some frequently investigated societal factors (e.g. educational and marital status) on suicide risk were very similar to those found in the majority of other countries. The effects of studied determinants of suicide have not changed dramatically over the past three decades in Hungary. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Suicide is an important public health hazard worldwide. A 4-year retrospective study from January 2000 to December 2003 was conducted to identify the favored methods in realized suicides among males and females in the west coastal region of India. During the study period, a total of 539 cases of suicidal deaths were autopsied. Males were predominantly affected (male: female-1.9:1). The age of the victims ranged from 13 to 90 years in males (mean = 40.1 years, median = 37.0 years) and 15 to 85 years in females (mean = 36.6 years, median = 32.0 years). Most favored method of suicide amongst males and females was hanging (36.9%, n = 199) followed by poisoning (34.7%, n = 187). Male dominance was apparent for each method of suicide except for self-immolation. Males were relatively more likely to use hanging and poisoning while females were more likely to prefer drowning and self-immolation as methods of suicide. Relatively younger females (mean = 33.0 years, median = 32.0 years) preferred hanging as a method of suicide when compared to males (mean = 42.4 years, median = 40.0 years). Among females, significantly younger females resorted to hanging when compared to older females who preferred drowning. On investigating the various theories proposed for choice of suicide methods in males and females in different regions we conclude that preference of method of suicide in men and women is complexly determined. In this region, availability, accessibility, popularity, and socioacceptability seem to be the major determinants in the choice of methods among males and females rather than violence associated and lethality of the method. Females were as likely to use lethal and violent methods as males in this region.

AB The relationship between economic fluctuations and mortality is assessed with data from Spain during the years 1980-1997, when national unemployment oscillated between 7% and 24%. Mortality rates of the Spanish provinces are modeled in fixed-effect panel regressions as functions of the demographic structure and the economic conditions. Unemployment effects on general mortality, sex-specific mortality, and mortality for major causes of death are negative, i.e., death rates increase procyclically when joblessness diminishes in an economic expansion. Homicides and female suicides are only weakly related or unrelated to economic fluctuations, but male suicides escalate countercyclically during economic downturns.

ID DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; STRESS; SUICIDE; FARMERS; INJURIES; ENGLAND;
   SATISFACTION; PREDICTORS; COMMUNITY
AB Background: Farmers experience one of the highest rates of suicide of any industry and there is growing evidence that those involved in farming are at higher risk of developing mental health problems. This article provides an overview of the literature examining mental health issues experienced by farming populations in the United Kingdom, Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States and identifies areas for further research.
   Method: A literature review (Medline, Science Direct, Ingenta, Proquest and PsychINFO) was carried out using the words 'farmers', 'agriculture', 'depression', I mental health', 'mental illness', 'stress', and 'suicide', as well as a review of relevant papers and publications known to the authors. (Papers not written in English and those published prior to 1985 were excluded.)
   Results: Fifty-two papers were identified with the majority focusing on stress and coping styles in farmers (24). A number of studies also focused on neuropsychological functioning and agricultural chemical use (7), depression (7), suicide (9), general mental health (4) and injury and mental health (1). This body of research studied male farmers, female farmers, farm workers, farming families, and young people living on farms. Research to date indicates that farmers, farm workers and their respective families face an array of stressors related to the physical environment, structure of farming families and the economic difficulties and uncertainties associated with farming which may be detrimental to their mental health.
   Conclusion: Whilst suicide rates in some groups of farmers are higher than the general population, conclusive data do not exist to indicate whether farmers and farming families experience higher rates of mental health problems compared with the non-farming community. It is clear, however, that farming is associated with a unique set of characteristics that is potentially hazardous to mental health and requires further research.

AB Recent studies have demonstrated that immigrants and ethnic minorities may be at higher risk of suicidal behaviour as compared to the general population. We conducted a literature search to identify studies in English from 1980 to 2017 related to suicide risk among immigrants and ethnic minorities. Six hundred and seventy-eight reports were screened, and 43 articles were included in the qualitative synthesis of the review. Some studies reported lower rates of suicide attempts, while other findings suggested higher rates of suicidal behaviour and deaths among immigrants as compared to the native population. Also, a positive correlation was found between suicidal behaviour and specific countries of origin. Non-European immigrant women were at the highest risk for suicide attempts, a group which included young women of South Asian and black African origin. Risk factors among migrants and ethnic minorities were found to be: language barriers, worrying about family back home, and separation from family. The lack of information on health care system, loss of status, loss of social network, and acculturation were identified as possible triggers for suicidal behaviour. Overall, results suggest that specific migrant populations and ethnic minorities present a higher risk of suicidal behaviour than native populations, as well as a higher risk of death by suicide.

AB Objectives. We investigated the possibility that men who have sex with men (MSM) and women who have sex with women (WSW) may be at higher risk for early mortality associated with suicide and other sexual orientation-associated health risks.
   Methods. We used data from the 1988-2002 General Social Surveys, with respondents followed up for mortality status as of December 31, 2008. The surveys included 17 886 persons aged 18 years or older, who reported at least 1 lifetime sexual partner. Of these, 853 reported any same-sex partners; 17 033 reported only different-sex partners. Using gender-stratified analyses, we compared these 2 groups for all-cause mortality and HIV-, suicide-, and breast cancer-related mortality.
   Results. The WSW evidenced greater risk for suicide mortality than presumptively heterosexual women, but there was no evidence of similar sexual orientation-associated risk among men. All-cause mortality did not appear to differ by sexual orientation among either women or men. HIV-related deaths were not elevated among MSM or breast cancer deaths among WSW.
   Conclusions. The elevated suicide mortality risk observed among WSW partially confirms public health concerns that sexual minorities experience greater burden from suicide-related mortality.

AB Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 beta and beta-catenin are important components of the Wnt signalling pathway, which is involved in numerous physiological functions such as cognition, brain development and cell survival. Their abnormalities have been implicated in mood disorders and schizophrenia. Teenage suicide is a major public health concern; however, very little is known about its neurobiology. In order to examine if abnormalities of GSK-3 beta and beta-catenin are associated with teenage suicide, we determined the gene and protein expression of GSK-3 beta and beta-catenin in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus obtained from 24 teenage suicide victims and 24 normal control subjects. Protein expression was determined using Western blot with specific antibodies and gene expression (mRNA levels) was determined using the real-time polymerase chain reaction method. No significant change was observed in the GSK-3 beta protein levels either in the PFC or hippocampus of suicide victims compared to controls. However, protein levels of pGSK-3 beta-ser(9) were significantly decreased in the PFC and hippocampus of suicide victims compared to normal controls. We also found that GSK-3 beta mRNA levels were significantly decreased in the PFC but not in the hippocampus of teenage suicide victims compared to controls. Mean protein and mRNA levels of beta-catenin were significantly decreased in both the PFC and hippocampus of teenage suicide group compared to controls. The observation that there is a decrease in beta-catenin and pGSK-3 beta-ser(9) in the PFC and hippocampus of teenage suicide victims does indicate a disturbance in the Wnt signalling pathway in teenage suicide.

AB A 44-year-old woman with a medical history of mental disorders and previous suicidal behaviour was found in a bathtub and pronounced death few minutes later despite of resuscitation attempts. After police investigation and on the basis of autopsy findings, the death was classified as suicide drowning. Retrospective examination of clinical data revealed, a prolonged rate-corrected QTinterval (QTc: 468 ms) 3 months before death. Post-mortem (PM) DNA analysis disclosed KCNH2(FIN) mutation for the long-QT syndrome (LQTS). The value of PM molecular screening for LQTS is emphasised, especially for victims of putative drowning.

AB Prior work from surveys and limited populations suggests many emergency department (ED) patients with suicide risk do not have documented lethal means assessments (e.g., being asked about home firearms). The specific objectives of this study were to, in an ED with universal screening for suicide risk: (1) estimate how often ED providers documented lethal means assessment for suicidal patients, and (2) compare patients with and without documented lethal means assessments. We reviewed 800 total charts from a random sample of adults in three a priori age groups (18-34 years; 35-59 years; 60 years) with a positive suicide risk screen from 8/2014 to 12/2015. Only 18% (n = 145) had documentation by 1 provider of assessment of lethal means access. Among these 145, only 8% (n = 11) had documentation that someone discussed an action plan to reduce access (most commonly changing home storage or moving objects out of the home). Among 545 suicidal patients discharged home from the ED, 85% had no documentation that any provider assessed access to lethal means. Our findings highlight an important area for improving care: routine, documented lethal means assessment and counseling for patients with suicide risk. There is an urgent need for further exploration of barriers and facilitators.

AB Many people feel that having a gun provides greater safety for them and their family. Actually, having a firearm in the home escalates the risk for death or injury, while using it to shoot someone who endangers the household is much less common. The resultant injuries, deaths, emotional turmoil, and/or disabilities lead to greater utilization of health care and legal/police services. Payment for these expenses is provided by higher insurance premiums and tax rates. This financial aspect has become a part of our country's current political concern over firearm ownership rights, gun violence or regulation, health care costs, the economy, and taxes.

AB Linking at-risk callers to ongoing mental health care is a key goal of crisis hotline interventions that has not often been addressed in evaluations of hotlines effectiveness. We conducted telephone interviews with 376 suicidal and 278 nonsuicidal crisis callers to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (Lifeline) to assess rates of mental health care utilization following Lifeline calls and to assess attitudinal and structural barriers to service utilization. Postcall utilization rates were approximately 50% for suicidal and crisis callers who received mental health care referrals. Lack of health insurance and callers perceptions about mental health problems emerged as significant barriers to accessing continued help.

ID YOUNG-ADULTS; TRENDS; SUICIDE; RACE
AB In 1999, the injury death rate for black males aged 15 24 in the USA was 80% greater than for white males: 148.5 vs 82.5/100 000, a difference of 66/100 000. Injury-specific changes between 1999 and 2005 in death rates for the 15-24 age group and in racial disparity were analysed using data from CDC's WISQARS. The gap between black and white all-injury death rates in males was reduced by 24%, to a difference of 50/100 000, largely because of greater decreases in the rates for motor vehicle crashes and firearm suicide in young black men than young white men, and large increases in suicide by suffocation and unintentional poisoning in the latter. Among females, despite a reduction in the black/white gap in firearm homicide rates, the gap between the races in total injury rates changed from a small black excess to a higher rate in young white women, which was due primarily to greater increases in these white women than black women in unintentional poisoning and suicide by suffocation, and greater decreases in black women than white women in firearm suicide.

AB Recent social changes and rising social inequality in the rural United States have affected the experience and meaning of mental illness and treatment seeking within rural communities. Rural Americans face serious mental health disparities, including higher rates of suicide and depression compared with residents of urban areas, and substance abuse rates in rural areas now equal those in urban areas. Despite these increased risks, people living in rural areas are less likely than their urban counterparts to seek or receive mental health services. This Open Forum calls for a research agenda supported by anthropological theory and methods to investigate the significance of this changed rural social context for mental health.

AB Gun violence and mental illness is a major area of media attention, especially because highly publicized mass shootings seem to have become more commonly reported in the press. Gun access also is undergoing a highly politicized debate in the United States. It is important for mental health practitioners to understand the background and context of laws related to firearms access, and to understand data related to risk of suicide and violence toward others caused by gun violence among persons with mental illness. In addition, clinically driven risk assessments with specific inquiry related to firearms can be important for identifying individuals for whom firearm-focused clinical risk mitigation may be warranted.

AB BACKGROUND Relapse and transplant-related complications are leading causes of mortality after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Suicides and accidents have not been studied in these patients. This study sought to determine whether there is an excess of suicide and accidental deaths after HSCT, and to determine risk factors. METHODS The incidence of suicidal and accidental death in patients after undergoing HSCT, standardized mortality ratio (SMR), and absolute excess risk (AER) of suicide and accidental deaths was determined, compared with the general European population. A case-control analysis was done to define factors associated with suicide and accidental deaths. Data were derived from the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Registry, including 294,922 patients who underwent autologous or allogeneic HSCT from 1980 to 2009. RESULTS The 10-year cumulative incidence of suicide and accidental deaths was 101.8 and 55.6 per 100,000 patients, respectively. SMR and AER of suicide after HSCT were 2.12 (P < .001) and 10.91, higher than in the European general population for 100,000 deaths, respectively. SMR and AER of accidental death were 1.23 (P < .05) and 2.54, respectively. In the case-control study, relapses were more frequent among patients who committed suicide after autologous HSCT (37% versus 18%; P < .0001). Chronic graft-versus-host disease was higher among patients who committed suicide after allogeneic HSCT (64% versus 37%; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS There is an excess of deaths due to suicide and accidents in patients after undergoing HSCT as compared with the European general population. Relapse was associated with more suicide and accidental deaths after autologous HSCT, and chronic graft-versus-host disease was associated with more deaths by suicide after allogeneic HSCT.

AB Background: Individuals under community corrections have multiple risk factors for mortality including exposure to a criminal environment, drug use, social stress, and a lack of medical care that predispose them to accidents, homicides, medical morbidities, and suicide. The literature suggests that prior suicidal behavior may be a particularly potent risk factor for mortality among individuals in the criminal justice system. Aims: This study looked to extend the link between history of a suicide attempt and future mortality in a community corrections population. Method: Using an archival dataset (N = 18,260) collected from 2002 to 2007 of individuals being monitored under community corrections supervision for an average of 217 days (SD = 268), we examined the association between past history of a suicide attempt and mortality. Results: A Cox Proportional Hazard Model controlling for age, race, gender, and substance dependence indicated that past history of a suicide attempt was independently associated with time to mortality, and demonstrated the second greatest effect after gender. Conclusion: These data suggest the need for a greater focus on screening and preventive services, particularly for individuals with a history of suicidal behavior, so as to reduce the risk of mortality in community corrections populations.

AB Objective: To compare the prevalence of suicidal ideation/attempts among Hispanic subgroups in the US in 1991-1992 and 2001-2002, and identify high-risk groups.
   Method: Data were drawn from the 1991-1992 National Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic Survey (NLAES, n = 42,862) and the 2001-2002 National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC, n = 43,093), two nationally representative surveys of individuals aged 18 years and older.
   Results: 1) Puerto Ricans are the Hispanic ethnic subgroup with the highest rates of suicide attempts; 2) 45- to 64-year-old Puerto Rican women are a high-risk group for suicide attempts; 3) Over the 10 year period between the two surveys, the lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts significantly increased among 18- to 24-year-old Puerto Rican women and Cuban men, and among 45- to 64-year-old Puerto Rican men.
   Conclusion: Hispanics in the US are not a homogeneous group. We identify high-risk groups among Hispanics. Specific interventions for subgroups of Hispanics at high risk for suicidal behaviors may be required. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The authors summarize the data derived from an extensive literature search regarding the relationship between alcoholism and suicide.
   Individual-level studies, which are mainly retrospective, show the frequency and characteristics of suicides and the extent of suicidal behavior among individuals with alcohol-related disorders. The studies show a clear and strong relationship between the two aberrant behaviors. This does not prove an unambiguous causal connection but provides further evidence for the possibility of a link. It seems that Durkheim's concept regarding the connection between the two phenomena has not stood the test of time. In the last decade, the relationship between alcoholism and suicide has been studied at the population-level, including time-series analyses, which have found sharp cultural differences between alcohol-consumption and suicide (different suicide rates in the "dry" and "wet" drinking cultures). The effects of restrictive governmental alcohol policies are examined. It is difficult to judge the relationship between drug abuse and suicidal behavior because of the lack of objective data and the frequent co-morbid conditions associated with drug abuse. However, at the individual level, a strong connection between the two deviant behaviors has been demonstrated.

AB Suicide is the second leading cause of death for those ages 13-25 in the United States. Coping is a mediator between stressful life events and adverse outcomes, and coping skills have been incorporated into interventions (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, safety planning interventions) for suicidal populations. However, longitudinal research has not directly examined the prospective associations between multiple coping styles and suicide-related outcomes in high-risk samples. This study identified cross-sectional and 4-month longitudinal associations of coping styles with suicide risk factors (i.e., depression, suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior) in a sample of 286 adolescent and young adult psychiatric emergency patients. Positive refraining was the coping style most consistently associated with positive outcomes, whereas self-blame and disengagement were consistently associated with negative outcomes. Active coping protected against suicidal behavior for males, but not for females. This was the first study to examine longitudinal relationships between coping and suicide-related outcomes in a high-risk clinical sample. Findings suggest that clinical interventions with suicidal adolescents and young adults may benefit from a specific focus on increasing positive reframing and reducing self-blame.

AB In addressing the shape of appropriate gun policy, this essay assumes for the sake of discussion that there is a legal and moral right to private gun ownership. My thesis is that, against the background of this right, the most defensible policy approach in the United States would feature moderate gun control. The first section summarizes the American gun control status quo and characterizes what I call "moderate gun control." The next section states and rebuts six leading arguments against this general approach to gun policy. The section that follows presents a positive case for moderate gun control that emphasizes safety in the home and society as well as rights whose enforcement entails some limits or qualifications on the right to bear arms. A final section shows how the recommended gun regulations address legitimate purposes, rather than imposing arbitrary restrictions on gun rights, and offers concluding reflections.

AB This study examines the question Does the rate of currently divorced in counties in the United States vary inversely to the relative percentage of concentration of adherents of seven different religious denominational groupings-Catholic, Jewish, Mormon, conservative Protestant, moderate Protestant, liberal Protestant, and miscellaneous Protestant-within those counties? The analysis is based on data from the 1990 U.S. Census and the Glenmary Research Center that pertain to a 20% random sample of counties from each of the 50 states (i.e., 621 counties). The results show, controlling for other selected variables known to be associated with the likelihood of divorce, that higher divorced rates are significantly related to a lower concentration of moderate Protestants, miscellaneous Protestants, Catholics, and Mormons.

AB Objective Well-tested and validated theories of suicide can help professionals understand, predict, and prevent suicide. This article presents two studies testing the suicidal ideation components of the Three-Step Theory (3ST) of suicide and comparing it to the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (ITS). We tested the 3ST's prediction that high levels of pain and hopelessness lead to suicidal ideation, which strengthens when pain and hopelessness outweigh connection to life. Method Study 1 (n = 204, mean age = 35, 56% female, 83% White) provides an independent, direct replication of the original analyses. Study 2 (n = 295, mean age = 25, 75% female, 68% White) presents the first conceptual extension of the 3ST using diverse measures of pain, hopelessness, and connection. In both studies, participants completed self-report questionnaires assessing the relevant variables. Results Both studies largely supported the first two steps of the 3ST, although adding connection to the model did not account for greater variability of suicidal ideation. The ITS accounted for comparable or greater amounts of variance in suicidal ideation than the 3ST. Conclusions Both the 3ST and the ITS have utility to explain suicidal ideation. Limitations and future directions are discussed.

With only a few state and local exceptions, the U.S. approach emphasizes the ability of most individuals to purchase, possess, and carry handguns. By comparison, Canada has a form of restrictive licensing for handguns that places a premium on community safety. The authors first review the potential individual and community level harms and benefits associated with these differing fre-arm policies. Using this information, they explore the ethical dimensions of the U.S. and Canadian approaches through three major themes of autonomy, prevention of harms, and social justice. The authors conclude that the Canadian approach is consistent with respect for the autonomy of persons, fosters the prevention of harms, and more appropriately furthers social justice.

AB Context Several studies have suggested that lithium treatment reduces risk of suicide in bipolar disorder, but no research has examined suicide risk during treatment with divalproex, the most commonly prescribed mood-stabilizing drug in the United States.
   Objective To compare risk of suicide attempt and suicide death during treatment with lithium with that during treatment with divalproex.
   Design and Setting Retrospective cohort study conducted at 2 large integrated health plans in California and Washington.
   Patients Population-based sample of 20638 health plan members aged 14 years or older who had at least 1 outpatient diagnosis of bipolar disorder and at least 1 filled prescription for lithium, divalproex, or carbamazepine between January,1, 1994, and December 31, 2001. Follow-up for each individual began with first qualifying prescription and ended with death, disenrollment from the health plan, or end of the study period.
   Main Outcome Measures Suicide attempt, recorded as a hospital discharge diagnosis or an emergency department diagnosis; suicide death, recorded on death certificate.
   Results In both health plans, unadjusted rates were greater during treatment with divalproex than during treatment with lithium for emergency department suicide attempt (31.3 vs 10.8 per 1000 person-years; P<.001), suicide attempt resulting in hospitalization (10.5 vs 4.2 per 1000 person-years; P<.001), and suicide death (1.7 vs 0.7 per 1000 person-years; P=.04). After adjustment for age, sex, health plan, year of diagnosis, comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions, and concomitant use of other psychotropic drugs, risk of suicide death was 2.7 times higher (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-6.3; P=.03) during treatment with divalproex than during treatment with lithium. Corresponding hazard ratios for nonfatal attempts were 1.7 (95% Cl, 1.2-2.3; P=.002) for attempts resulting in hospitalization and 1.8 (95% C1, 1.4-2.2; P<.001) for attempts diagnosed in the emergency department.
   Conclusion Among patients treated for bipolar disorder, risk of suicide attempt and suicide death is lower during treatment with lithium than during treatment with divalproex.

AB Suicide ideations, attempts and completed suicides are frequent situations in clinical practice of child and adolescent psychiatry. Besides, these situations especially are more common in adolescence period and suicide is one of the major causes of death for this age group. Just because of its easy accessibility, paracetamol (acetominophen) is a drug that is commonly used in suicidal attempts. Paracetamol toxicity is a fatal situation which is one of the most frequent causes of acute liver failure. Liver transplantation is the only option for treatment of acute liver failure. Transplantation from a living donor is the first option because of limited organ sources. In transplantation process, both donor and recipient must be evaluated psychiatrically. Child and adult psychiatrists must work in cooperation with organ transplantation team, in this emergency of which a race against time endures. Furthermore, unlike from adult psychiatrists, child psychiatrists have to evaluate candidate pediatric cases according to their developmental characteristics. In this article, we aimed to evaluate pretransplantational process of child psychiatry consultation in an adolescent who has hepatic failure due to paracetamol intoxication. We discussed the common and urgent medical and psychiatric situations that may be experienced in emergent transplantation cases.

ID ENCOUNTERING PATIENT SUICIDE; PREVENTION; EXPERIENCE; CURRICULUM;
   PROGRAMS; IMPACT
AB Objective: Because of the clinical significance of patient suicide for trainees and current limited information on this essential educational subject, the authors sought to determine what topics involving the care of suicidal patients were taught to residents in psychiatry training programs.
   Methods: Chief residents of psychiatry training programs across the United States (response rate 59%) anonymously completed questions on what and how the care of suicidal patients was taught. Topics that required more attention and barriers to teaching were also identified.
   Results: A vast majority of the national programs (91%) offered formal teaching on suicide care; grand rounds (85%) and case conferences (80%) were also popular methods for teaching. Even the topics most commonly taught, such as risk factors, recognizing early warning signs, and standards of clinical care, were judged to warrant more attention by many residents. Commonly identified barriers to teaching included the lack of audio or video teaching materials and relevant texts. Only 19% of chief residents reported that they felt prepared for the possibility of having to manage the aftermath of a patient suicide.
   Conclusion: The chief residents identified a need for programs to focus even more attention on teaching of the care of suicidal patients in training programs.

AB Objectives. This study examined lifetime prevalence of suicide symptoms and affective disorders among men reporting a history of same-sex sexual partners.
   Methods. in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, men aged 17 to 39 years were assessed for lifetime history of affective disorders and sexual behavior patterns. The study classified this subset of men into 3 groups: those reporting same-sex sexual partners, those reporting only female sexual partners, and those reporting no sexual partners. Groups were compared for histories of suicide symptoms and affective disorders.
   Results. a total of 2.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3%, 3.1%) of men reported same-sex sexual partners. These men evidenced greater lifetime prevalence rates of suicide symptoms than men reporting only female partners. However, homosexually/bisexually experienced men were no more likely than exclusively heterosexual men to meet criteria for lifetime diagnosis of other affective disorders.
   Conclusions. These data provide further evidence of an increased risk for suicide symptoms among homosexually experienced men. Results also hint at a small, increased risk of recurrent depression among gay men, with symptom onset occurring, on average, during early adolescence.

AB Objectives. To investigate the impact of the Australian National Firearms Agreement (NFA) on suicide and assault mortality.
   Methods. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional difference-in-difference study of the impact of the NFA on national mortality rates in the Australian population from 1961 to 2015.
   Results. The NFA had no additional statistically observable impact on firearm-related suicides in women (P = .09) and was associated with a statistically significant increase in the trend in men (P<.001). Trends in non-firearm-related suicide deaths declined by 4.4% per year (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.1%, 4.8%) in men after the introduction of the NFA and increased in women by 0.3% (95% CI = 0.1%, 0.7%). Trends in non-firearm-related homicides declined by 2.2% per year (95% CI = 1.5, 3.8%) in women and 2.9% per year (95% CI = 2.0%, 3.7%) in men after the introduction of the NFA, with a statistically significant improvement in trends for women (P = .04)but not for men (P = .80).
   Conclusions. The NFA had no statistically observable additional impact on suicide or assault mortality attributable to firearms in Australia.

AB Two studies were conducted among patients in a male dual diagnosis (severe mental illness [SMI] with substance use) ward. The research examined the following questions: (1) Do immigrant and non-immigrant dual diagnosis patients exhibit similar or different socio-demographic, clinical and criminological characteristics? (2) What are the implications for treatment of immigrant (and non-immigrant) patients? Study one analyzed computerized hospital records of 413 male patients; Study two examined patient files of a subgroup of 141 (70 immigrant) male patients. Alongside similarities, non-immigrant patients reported higher numbers of repeat and involuntary hospitalizations and more drug use while immigrants showed longer hospitalizations, more suicide attempts, more violent suicide attempts, more violent offenses and more alcohol use. Among non-immigrants significant relationships were found between severity of SMI and crime/violence while among immigrants a significant relationship was found between suicidality and crime/violence. Implications for treatment include need for awareness of suicide risk among immigrant dual-diagnosis patients and an understanding of the differential relationship with crime/violence for the two populations.

AB Few studies have examined the role of culturally relevant factors in suicidal behavior among Asian Americans. Using the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS) (Alegria et al., 2004; Heeringa et al., 2004), the current study examined the role of culturally related variables (family conflict, perceived discrimination, and ethnic identity) on suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in a nationally representative sample of 2,095 Asian Americans. Important covariates were sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, marital status, years of education, household poverty, and nativity status), depressive and anxiety disorders, and number of chronic conditions. Gender related correlates were also explored. The lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts was 8.8% and 2.5%, respectively. Female gender, family conflict, perceived discrimination, and the presence of lifetime depressive or anxiety disorders were positively correlated with suicidal ideation and attempts. A high level of identification with one's ethnic group was associated with lower rates of suicide attempts. Among Asian men, but not women, the presence of chronic medical conditions was associated with suicidal ideation. Findings highlight the contributions to suicide risk of cultural factors and gender differences in Asian Americans.

AB Introduction: There has been a concern about indiscriminate use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in Asian countries. This study examined the rates of ECT use and the characteristics and outcomes of patients treated with ECT in Hong Kong. Method: A central database of ECT treatments was used to calculate annual rates of ECT use from 1997 to 2002. We surveyed prospectively patients received ECT over 12 months by a standardized questionnaire. Results: The ECT utilization rates varied from 0.27 to 0.34 patients treated per 10,000 population and 1.34 to 1.88 patients treated per 100 inpatients discharged. There were differences in the pattern of ECT use among Hong Kong, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Only 15% of ECT recipients were 65 years old or older and 23% had schizophrenia as primary diagnosis for ECT. Ninety-five percent of patients who received ECT improved with the treatment as assessed by clinicians. No severe complications and deaths occurred, and 6% stopped ECT due to undesirable results. Conclusion: The rate of ECT use in Hong Kong continues to be below that in the United States and the United Kingdom. Access to ECT is most limited to the elderly and private patients.

AB Objective: Alcohol intoxication and dependence are risk factors for suicide, a leading cause of death in the United States. We examined the hours of peak and nadir in completed suicides over a 24-hour period among intoxicated, alcohol-dependent individuals. We also evaluated suicid-related factors associated with intoxication at different times of the day.
   Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data from the 2003-2010 National Violent Death Reporting System provided by 16 US states. In the primary database, the deceased individuals' alcohol-dependent status was classified as "yes" or " no or unknown." We restricted the analysis to alcohol-dependent individuals with alcohol level data available (N = 3,661). The primary outcome measure was the reported time of death. Secondary outcome measures were predisposing and injury-related factors. Individuals were classified on the basis of their blood alcohol level (BAL) as heavy drinking (BAL(H) [>= 80 mg/dL]) or non-heavy drinking (BAL(O) [< 80 mg/dL]). The time of injury was divided into 1-hour bins, which were used to compute the incidence of suicide over 24 hours. We also evaluated the association between clinical factors and BAL(H) for each of six 4-hour time periods beginning at 00:01 hours.
   Results: The majority (73.4%) of individuals showed evidence of alcohol consumption prior to committing suicide. BAL(H) was observed in 60.7% of all individuals. Peak incidences in suicide were identified at 21: 00 for BAL(H) and 12: 00 for BAL(O), with nadirs at 05: 00 and 03: 00 hours, respectively. In a multivariable analysis, between 20: 01 and 00: 00 hours, BAL(H) was associated with more risk and protective factors than BAL(O).
   Conclusions: Identifying critical times and associated risk factors for suicidal behavior may contribute to suicide prevention efforts in intoxicated alcohol-dependent individuals.

AB The inner experience of spiritual and religious feelings is an integral part of the everyday lives of many individuals. For over 100 years the role of religion as a deterrent to suicidal behavior has been studied in various disciplines. We attempt to systematize the existing literature investigating the relationship between religion/spirituality and suicide in this paper. After an overview of the attitudes of the dominant religions (e.g., Catholicism, Islam, and Buddhism) toward suicide, the three main theories that have speculated regarding the link between religion and suicide are presented: "Integration theory" (Durkheim, 1897/1997), "religious commitment theory" (Stack, 1983a; Stark, 1983), and "network theory" (Pescosolido & Georgianna, 1989). Subsequent to this theoretical introduction, we report on studies on religion/spirituality keeping the suicidal path as a reference: from suicidal ideation to nonlethal suicidal behavior to lethal suicidal behavior. Studies presenting indications of religious beliefs as a possible risk factor for suicidal behavior are also presented. The last section reviews possible intervention strategies for suicidal patients and suicide survivors. Indications for future research, such as more studies on nonreligious forms of spirituality and the use of qualitative methodology to achieve a better and deeper understanding of the spiritual dimension of suicidal behavior and treatment, are offered.

AB This research explores geographic variability of factors on social inequality related to mental health in the United States using county-level data in 2014. First, we account for complex design factors in Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data such as clustering, stratification, and sample weight using Complex Samples General Linear Model (CSGLM). Then, three variables are used in the model as indicators of social inequality, low socioeconomic status (SES): unemployment, education status, and social association status. A geographically weighted regression analysis is applied to examine the spatial variations in the associations of mentally unhealthy days (MUDs) with the indicators of SES in the United States. The results demonstrate that unemployment and education level show global positive and negative influences respectively on MUDs. Social association status ranged from positive to negative across the United States, implying some geographic clustering. These findings suggest that social and health policies should be adjusted to address the different effects of indicators of social inequality on mental health across different social characteristics of communities to more effectively manage mental health problems.

AB Purpose To explore how oncologists, oncology nurses, and oncology social workers perceive suicidality (suicidal ideation, suicidal acts, and completed suicides) in patients with cancer that they are in contact with. Methods The grounded theory method of data collection and analysis was used. Sixty-one oncology healthcare professionals from two university-affiliated cancer centers in Israel were interviewed. Results The findings resulted in three main categories that included perceptions of suicidality, explanatory models of suicidality, and moral views on suicide. Healthcare professionals considered suicidality in their patients to be a cry for help, a sign of distress, or an attempt at attention seeking. Participants explained suicidality as stemming from a biological disease, from mental illness, as an aberration, or as an impulsive, irrational act. Moral views on suicidality were split among those who were mostly accepting of these patients' actions versus those who rejected it outright. A third group of healthcare professionals expressed ambivalence about suicidality in their patients. Conclusions Healthcare professionals vary greatly in their perceptions on suicide. Some view the act as part of a patient's choice and autonomy while others view it negatively. Healthcare providers should receive support in handling patient's suicidality.

AB Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent of psychiatric disorders, yet less than 30% of individuals who suffer from anxiety disorders seek treatment. Prevalence of anxiety disorders is difficult to pinpoint since even small changes in diagnostic criteria, interview tools, or study methodology affect results. Analyses of the largest prevalence studies of psychiatric illnesses in the United States find that anxiety disorders afflict 15.7 million people in the United States each year, and 30 million people in the United States at some point in their lives. Currently, the European Study of Epidemiology of Mental Disorders and the World Health Organization World Mental Health 2000 studies are underway. These studies, which share a similar methodology, will facilitate future worldwide comparisons of the prevalence of anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders impose high individual and social burden, tend to be chronic, and can be as disabling as somatic disorders. Compared with those who have other psychiatric disorders, people with anxiety disorders are high care utilizers who present to general practitioners more frequently than to psychiatric professionals, placing a strain upon the health care system. The economic costs of anxiety disorders include psychiatric, nonpsychiatric, and emergency care; hospitalization; prescription drugs; reduced productivity; absenteeism from work; and suicide.

AB BackgroundUnintentional gun death occurs four times more often in the United States than other high-income countries. Research on these deaths typically has a narrow scope. We believe this is the first study describing the circumstances of these deaths in the United States that covers more than a single state or municipality.MethodsWe use data on all unintentional firearm fatalities in the sixteen states reporting to the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) for all years 2005-2015. Our final count of unintentional firearm deaths in these states and years is 1260. The detailed nature of the data allows us to categorize and compare the circumstances of the incident.ResultsWe estimate 430 unintentional firearm fatalities in the United States per year. The rate is highest for older children to young adults, ages 10 to 29, and the vast majority of the victims are male. Common circumstances include playing with the gun (28.3% of incidents), thinking the gun was unloaded (17.2%), and hunting (13.8%). The victim is suspected to have consumed alcohol in nearly a quarter of the deaths and in 46.8% of deaths among those aged 20-29.ConclusionsCertain circumstances, such as consuming alcohol, playing with the gun, and hunting, are common settings for unintentional firearm deaths. Firearm safety instructors, firearm manufacturers, and firearm owners can all contribute to preventing these deaths.

   THOUGHTS; SOLDIERS; IDEATION; BEHAVIOR; ARMY
AB Objective: Suicide among United States service members is a significant public health concern. Intimate partner relationship stress may contribute to suicide risk, as a failed or failing relationship is the most commonly documented stressor preceding military suicide attempts and deaths. However, little is known about the manner by which relationship stressors are associated with the experience of military suicidality.
   Methods: A sample of 190 psychiatrically hospitalized military personnel and adult dependents enrolled in an ongoing randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of an inpatient cognitive behavioral treatment for suicidality were included in this study. Analyses examined depression, hopelessness, and suicidality among participants with (n = 105) and without (n = 85) self-reported romantic relationship stress.
   Results: Over half (55%) of the sample reported current romantic relationship stress. Compared to participants without current romantic relationship stress, results indicated that individuals reporting current romantic relationship stress were more hopeless (AOR = 1.07 (95% CI: 1.01-1.12),p = 0.020), more likely to endorse multiple suicide attempts (AOR = 1.96 (95% CI: 1.01-3.79), p = 0.046), had higher overall suicide risk (AOR = 2.49, (95% CI: 1.03-6.06), p = 0.044), and were more likely to report that the reason for their suicidality was at least in part to get a reaction from others.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest romantic relationship stress is associated with greater suicide risk, and have clinical implications for suicide prevention and intervention. Future research may examine mechanisms and pathways between romantic relationship stress, suicidality, and prevention and intervention strategies. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Suicide is the second leading cause of death, worldwide, for those between the ages of 24 and 44 y old. In 2013, more than 41,000 suicides occurred in the United States. These statistics underscore the need to 1) understand why people die by suicide and 2) identify risk factors that are potentially modifiable. While it has been posited that sleep disturbance may represent one such factor, systematic research in this arena did not begin until the 2000s. Since that time, sleep disturbance has been reliably identified as a risk factor for suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide. While insomnia, nightmares, and other sleep disorders have each been found to contribute to the risk for suicidal ideation and behavior, it is also possible that these factors share some common variance. One possibility is that sleep disturbance results in being awake at night, and being awake at night also confers risk. The hypothesis proffered here is that being awake when one is not biologically prepared to be so results in "hypofrontality" and diminished executive function, and that this represents a common pathway to suicidal ideation and behavior. Such a proposition is highly testable under a variety of possible protocols. The current review summarizes the extant literature on suicide rates by time-of-day, and discusses circadian, psychosocial, and neurocognitive explanations of risk. Such a focus promises to enhance our understanding of how sleep disturbance may confer risk, allows for the identification of future lines of research, and further justifies the need for interventions that promote good sleep continuity among at-risk individuals.

AB Background: Previous work has suggested that anxiety disorders are associated with suicide attempts. However, many studies have been limited by lark of accounting for factors that could influence this relationship, notably personality disorders. This study aims to examine the relationship between anxiety disorders and suicide attempts, accounting for important comorbidities, in a large nationally representative sample. Methods: Data came from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions Wave 2. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 34,653 adults between 2004 and 2005 in the United States. The relationship between suicide attempts and anxiety disorders (panic disorder; agoraphobia, social phobia, specific phobia, generalized anxiety disorder; posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)) was explored using multivariate regression models controlling for sociodemographics, Axis I and Axis II disorders. Results: Among individuals reporting a lifetime history of suicide attempt, over 70% had an anxiety disorder Even after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, Axis I and Axis I I disorders, the presence of an anxiety disorder was significantly associated with having made a suicide attempt (AOR= 1.70, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.40-2.08). Panic disorder (AOR= 1.31, 95% CI: 1.06-1.61) and PTSD (AOR= 1.81, 95% CI: 1.45-2.26) were independently associated with suicide attempts in multivariate models. Comorbidity of personality disorders with panic disorder (AOR= 5.76, 95% CI: 4.58-7.25) and with PTSD (AOR= 6.90, 95% CI: 5.41-8.79) demonstrated much stronger associations with suicide attempts over either disorder alone. Conclusion: Anxiety disorders, especially panic disorder and PTSD, are independently associated with suicide attempts. Clinicians need to assess suicidal behavior among patients presenting with anxiety problems. Depression and Anxiety 27:791-798, 2010. (C) 2010 Wiky-Liss, Inc.

AB Background: The World Health Organisation SUicide PREvention-Multisite Intervention Study on Suicide (WHO/SUPRE-MISS) investigates suicidal behaviours in a number of nations. The feasibility of the different branches of the study was piloted in Queensland, Australia. This paper reports on the community survey component.
   Method: Randomised telephone interviews (n = 11,572) were conducted to determine the lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts, and corresponding socio-demographic and cultural characteristics. A subsequent postal survey sent to consenting individuals reporting lifetime suicide ideation/attempt (n=1311) was meant to ascertain the possible development of that behaviour along a continuum, psychiatric and psychological factors, suicidal transmission, help-seeking, and service utilisation.
   Results: Suicide ideation and attempts prevailed in individuals aged 25-44 years, and declined with increasing age. In most cases, suicidal experience/s did not develop over time with progressively increasing severity. Knowledge of someone else's suicidal behaviour significantly increased the risk of similar acts. Almost half of the subjects contended with their suicidal crisis by over-drinking alcohol, and 1/3 through other forms of reckless behaviour. The ratio completed/attempted suicide was 1 to 23. Less than 30% of subjects went to the hospital after their suicidal behaviour, and treatment received and staff attitudes were rated less favourably than that of General Practitioners.
   Conclusions: This survey provides a reliable picture of suicide ideation and behaviour in the general population. Information on the development of suicidal process, recklessness, and help-seeking attitudes may be valuable for future prevention strategies. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. Alrights reserved.

DE suicide; epidemiology; Newfoundland and Labrador
ID MARITAL-STATUS; UNITED-STATES; RISK
AB Objective: To examine suicide epidemiology in Newfoundland and Labrador from 1997 to 2001.
   Method: Data from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (CME) were linked with data derived from the Canadian Vital Statistics Death Database. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to assess variation of rates. We used the chi-square test to compare categorical data.
   Results: The CME recorded 225 suicide deaths, compared with 187 in the Canadian Vital Statistics Death Database. Most deaths not coded as suicide in the national database were coded as accidental. Using the CME data, the overall suicide rate was 9.5/100 000, aged 10 years and older. The rate among males (15.8/100 000, 95%CI, 10.7 to 20.8) was almost 5 times that of females (3.3/100 000; 95 %CI, 1.0 to 5.5). Age-standardized rates decreased over the study period, from 10.9 to 8.0/100 000; however, the difference was not significant. The proportionate mortality ratio for suicide deaths was highest among those aged 10 to 19 years (20.0%) and decreased with age. The suicide rate was highest among those aged 50 to 59 years. The rate for unpartnered individuals (17.0/100 000, 95%CI, 10.7 to 23.0) was significantly higher, compared with partnered individuals (5.1/100 000; 95 %CI, 2.5 to 7.8). Males used more violent methods than females. Suicide was significantly higher in Labrador (27.7/100 000, 95%CI, 18.4 to 37.0), an area with a higher Aboriginal population, compared with the island of Newfoundland (8.5/100 000, 95%CI, 7.3 to 9.7). Psychiatric illness was the most common predisposing factor.
   Conclusions: Suicide deaths are highest among males, unpartnered individuals, and individuals with psychiatric disorders.

   RATES; DEATH; RISK; MISCLASSIFICATION
AB OBJECTIVE
   To assess proportionate mortality ratios (PMRs) for suicide among male and female US veterinarians from 1979 through 2015.
   DESIGN
   PMR study.
   SAMPLE
   Death records for 11,620 veterinarians.
   PROCEDURES
   Information for veterinarians who died during 1979 through 2015 was obtained from AVMA obituary and life insurance databases and submitted to a centralized database of US death records to obtain underlying causes of death. Decedent data that met records-matching criteria were imported into a software program for calculation of PMRs for suicide stratified by sex and indirectly standardized for age, race, and 5-year calendar period with 95% confidence intervals.
   RESULTS
   398 deaths resulted from suicide; 326 (82%) decedents were male, 72 (18%) were female, and most (298 [75%]) were <= 65 years of age. The PMRs for suicide for all veterinarian decedents (2.1 and 3.5 for males and females, respectively), those in clinical positions (2.2 and 3.4 for males and females, respectively), and those in nonclinical positions (1.8 and 5.0 for males and females, respectively) were significantly higher than for the general US population. Among female veterinarians, the percentage of deaths by suicide was stable from 2000 until the end of the study, but the number of such deaths subjectively increased with each 5-year period.
   CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE
   Results of the study indicated that PMRs for suicide of female as well as male veterinarians were higher than for the general population. These data may help to inform stakeholders in the creation and implementation of suicide prevention strategies designed for veterinarians.

ID MENTAL-HEALTH; POTENTIAL YEARS; LIFE LOST; SURVIVORS; GRIEF; DEPRESSION;
   ACCIDENT; DISTRESS; PARENTS; VIOLENT
AB Background: Little research has been conducted into the physical health implications of suicide bereavement compared to other causes of death. There is some evidence that suicide bereaved parents have higher morbidity, particularly in terms of chronic illness. This systematic review aims to examine the physical and psychosomatic morbidities of people bereaved by a family member's suicide and compare them with family members bereaved by other modes of death.
   Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were searched from 1985 to February 2016. The search was re-run in March 2017. Peer-reviewed English language articles comparing suicide-bereaved family members to non-suicide bereaved family members on measures of physical or psychosomatic health were eligible for inclusion. Cohort, cross-sectional, case-control and cohort-based register studies were eligible for inclusion. A modified version of the Newcastle Ottawa Scale was used for quality assessment. Results were synthesised using narrative synthesis.
   Results: The literature search located 24 studies which met the inclusion criteria. Seven studies found statistically significant associations between physical health and suicide bereavement. Five of the studies found that suicide-bereaved family members were more likely to experience pain, more physical illnesses and poorer general health. They were also at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In contrast, another study in Denmark found that those bereaved by suicide had a lower risk of a number of physical health disorders, including cancers, diabetes, cardiovascular and chronic lower respiratory tract disorders compared to those bereaved by other causes of death. Additionally, a further study conducted in the United States found that suicide-bereaved children visited a GP less frequently than non-suicide bereaved children.
   Conclusions: Review findings are relevant for clinicians working with people bereaved by suicide as they highlight that such clients are at increased risk of several adverse physical health outcomes. Future research should examine health risk behaviours of suicide-bereaved and non-suicide bereaved family members as they may confound the association between exposure and outcome.

However, little is known about predictors of onset and course of suicidality in the general population. Our study tried to fill this gap by analyzing data from a prospectively followed community sample.
   Method: Data were derived from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS), a 3-wave cohort study in a representative sample (n = 4848) of the Dutch adult general population.
   Results: The 3-year incidence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts was 2.7% and 0.9%, respectively. Predictors of first-onset suicidal ideation and suicide attempts were sociodemographic variables (especially the negative change in situation variables), life events, personal vulnerability indicators, and emotional (mood and anxiety) disorders. Comparison of the corresponding odds ratios and confidence intervals revealed that predictors for first-onset suicidal ideation and suicide attempts did not differ significantly. One of the strongest predictors of incident suicide attempts was previous suicidal ideation. Regarding the course of suicidal ideation, it was found that 31.3% still endorsed these thoughts and 7.4% reported having made a suicide attempt 2 years later.
   Conclusions: Similar predictors were found for first-onset suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. This suggests that suicidal behaviours may be ordered on a continuum and have shared risk factors. While suicidal thoughts may be necessary for, they are not sufficient predictors of, suicidal acts. The course of suicidality in the general population can be characterized by a minority of people having suicidal experiences that develop over time with progressively increasing severity.

AB Background: To date, a culturally-sensitive psychological instrument has not been developed to evaluate military attitudes toward suicide. Understanding these attitudes can inform suicide prevention research, clinical practice, and policy. We aimed to develop such an instrument and to evaluate its psychometric properties using an active-duty military sample.
   Methods: A team of military personnel, suicidologists, and researchers assisted with item development. A cross-sectional design was used to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Military Suicide Attitudes Questionnaire (MSAQ) via an online survey battery. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted.
   Results: A total of 317 military service members met eligibility criteria and completed the online surveys. A four-factor model that explained 46.4% of the variance was identified: (1) Individual-Based Rejection versus Acceptance; (2) Psychache versus Pathological; (3) Unit-Based Rejection versus Acceptance; (4) Moral versus Immoral. The MSAQ demonstrated high partial validity and test retest reliability. Limitations: The study used a convenience sample and did not control for social desirability.
   Conclusions: The newly developed MSAQ is a promising measure that fills a notable gap in the assessment of suicide attitudes within the United States military. The MSAQ has the potential for future use in evaluating suicide prevention and stigma reduction programs within the Department of Defense. Additionally, the MSAQ may serve as a useful tool for leadership in the evaluation of command climates. In clinical settings, the MSAQ could be used along with other cognitive and attitudinal measures to track suicidal patients' attitude towards suicide over the course of treatment.

AB Background. Seasonal as well as weekly cycles in suicide have been described, replicated and poorly understood for a long time. In Western countries, suicides are typically least frequent on weekends and most frequent on Mondays and Tuesdays. To improve understanding of this phenomenon a strategy is required which focuses on anomalous findings beyond the regular patterns. Here, we focused on instances where the weekly suicide patterns disappear or are interrupted.
   Methods. We used data from Swiss and Austrian mortality statistics for the periods 1969-2010 and 1970-2010, respectively. First, the data were cross-tabulated by days of the week and the available socio-demographic information (sex, age, religious affiliation and region). Second, time series of cumulated daily frequencies of suicide were analysed by seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models which included intervention effects accounting for Easter and Pentecost (Whit) holidays.
   Results. First, the cross tabulations showed that weekly cycles may be smoothed above all in young persons and smoothed in drowning, jumping and car gas exhaustion suicides. Second, the ARIMA analyses displayed occasional preventive effects for holidays Saturdays and Sundays, and more systematic effects for holiday Mondays. There were no after effects on Tuesdays following holiday Mondays.
   Conclusions. In general, the weekend dip and the Monday backlog effect in suicide show striking similarities to the Advent season effect and are interpretable within the same template. The turning points between low and high frequencies possibly provide promising frames for the timing of prevention activities.

AB Background. Suicide is a major global health concern. Bhutanese refugees resettled in the USA are disproportionately affected by suicide, yet little research has been conducted to identify factors contributing to this vulnerability. This study aims to investigate the issue of suicide of Bhutanese refugee communities via an in-depth qualitative, social-ecological approach.
   Methods. Focus groups were conducted with 83 Bhutanese refugees (adults and children), to explore the perceived causes, and risk and protective factors for suicide, at individual, family, community, and societal levels. Audio recordings were translated and transcribed, and inductive thematic analysis conducted.
   Results. Themes identified can be situated across all levels of the social-ecological model. Individual thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are only fully understood when considering past experiences, and stressors at other levels of an individual's social ecology. Shifting dynamics and conflict within the family are pervasive and challenging. Within the community, there is a high prevalence of suicide, yet major barriers to communicating with others about distress and suicidality. At the societal level, difficulties relating to acculturation, citizenship, employment and finances, language, and literacy are influential. Two themes cut across several levels of the ecosystem: loss; and isolation, exclusion, and loneliness.
   Conclusions. This study extends on existing research and highlights the necessity for future intervention models of suicide to move beyond an individual focus, and consider factors at all levels of refugees' social-ecology. Simply focusing treatment at the individual level is not sufficient. Researchers and practitioners should strive for community-driven, culturally relevant, socio-ecological approaches for prevention and treatment.

AB Previous studies of psychological morbidity produced by September 11, 2001, focused primarily on short-term development of posttraumatic stress disorder or depression in East Coast cities targeted. This study aimed to determine whether suicide attempts medically harmful enough to necessitate admission to the general hospital increased in the 2 years following September 11, 200 1, in a region not on the East Coast, and if so, to characterize individuals contributing to this increase. This retrospective study compared two time periods: 2 years preceding and 2 years following September 11, 2001. Psychiatric consultation reports for all suicide attempters medically admitted to the University of Michigan Health Systems Hospital in Ann Arbor, Michigan, were examined (N = 254). In the 2-year period following September 11, 2001, there was a 49% increase in the number of individuals making a harmful suicide attempt (p = 0.002). The effect was greatest in the months following the attacks but continued over the next year, with a stepwise decline corresponding to the number of months elapsed since September 11. In the period following September 11, 2001, fewer subjects reported multiple personal stressors (p = 0.03). The subjects in the two time periods were not significantly different in age, gender, prior suicide attempts, prior psychiatric treatment, alcohol abuse, substance abuse, depression, or psychosis. Over-representation by those most vulnerable to suicide attempts did not account for the increased number of suicide attempts. The effects of chronic stress in the general population across the United States elicited by the terrorism of September 11, 2001, may have been of greater magnitude and longer lasting than previously realized.

AB IMPORTANCE According to National Patient Safety Goal 15.01.01, all individuals being treated or evaluated for behavioral health conditions as their primary reason for care in hospitals and behavioral health care organizations accredited by The Joint Commission should be screened for suicide risk using a validated tool. Existing suicide risk screens have minimal or no high-quality evidence of association with future suicide-related outcomes.
   OBJECTIVE To test the association between results of the Ask Suicide-Screening Questions (ASQ) instrument in a pediatric emergency department (ED), implemented through selective and universal screening approaches, and subsequent suicide-related outcomes.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this retrospective cohort study at an urban pediatric ED in the United States, the ASQ was administered to youths aged 8 to 18 years with behavioral and psychiatric presenting problems from March 18, 2013, to December 31, 2016 (selective condition), and then to youths aged 10 to 18 years with medical presenting problems (in addition to those aged 8-18 years with behavioral and psychiatric presenting problems) from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2018 (universal condition).
   EXPOSURE Positive ASQ screen at baseline ED visit.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcomes were subsequent ED visits with suicide-related presenting problems (ie, ideation or attempts) based on electronic health records and death by suicide identified through state medical examiner records. Association with suicide-related outcomes was calculated over the entire study period using survival analyses and at 3-month follow-up for both conditions using relative risk.
   RESULTS The complete sample was 15 003 youths (7044 [47.0%] male; 10 209 [68.0%] black; mean [SD] age, 14.5 [3.1] years at baseline). The follow-up for the selective condition was a mean (SD) of 1133.7 (433.3) days; for the universal condition, it was 366.2 (209.2) days. In the selective condition, there were 275 suicide-related ED visits and 3 deaths by suicide. In the universal condition, there were 118 suicide-related ED visits and no deaths during the follow-up period. Adjusting for demographic characteristics and baseline presenting problem, positive ASQ screens were associated with greater risk of suicide-related outcomes among both the universal sample (hazard ratio, 6.8 [95% CI, 4.2-11.1]) and the selective sample (hazard ratio, 4.8 [95% CI, 3.5-6.5]).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Positive results of both selective and universal screening for suicide risk in pediatric EDs appear to be associated with subsequent suicidal behavior. Screening may be a particularly effective way to detect suicide risk among those who did not present with ideation or attempt. Future studies should examine the impact of screening in combination with other policies and procedures aimed at reducing suicide risk.

AB Objectives This study investigated secular trends in socio-economic status (SES) differentials in Australian suicide (1979-2003), which includes overall declines in male suicide from 1998. Method Suicide rates were stratified by approximate equal-population quintiles of area-based SES for the period 1979-2003 and examined across five quinquennia, centred on each Australian Census from 1981 to 2001, to determine if (1) SES differentials in suicide have persisted over time, and (2) if SES differentials have widened or narrowed. Suicide rates (per 100,000) were adjusted for confounding by sex, age, country-of-birth, and urban-rural residence using Poisson regression models, and secular changes in SES differentials were assessed using trend tests on suicide rate ratios (low to high SES quintiles). Results Socio-economic status (SES) differentials persisted across the study period for both males and females after adjusting for the effects of age, migrant status, and urban-rural residence, with the largest differences between low and high SES groups evident in males, and especially young males (20-34 years). For males, suicide rates increased significantly in all SES groups until 1998, before diverging significantly in the most recent 5-year period, particularly in younger males (P < 0.0001). In young males, suicide rates in the most recent period increased in the low SES group from 44.8 in 1994-1998 to 48.6 in 1999-2003 (an 8% increase). In contrast, suicide rates in the middle SES group decreased from a peak of 37.3 to 33.5 (a 10% decrease), and in the high SES group from a peak of 33.0 to 27.9 (a 15% decrease). A similar statistically significant divergence of a lesser magnitude was also evident in all age males and younger females (20-34 years). Conclusion This study shows that SES differentials in suicide persisted in Australia for most of the period 1979-2004. The decline in suicide in young males in the most recent quinquennium was limited to middle and high SES groups, while the low SES group displayed a continued increase. The continued increase in suicide in low SES males has implications for social and economic intervention and suicide control programs.

AB Background: Suicide is a growing public health problem, with the national rate in the United States increasing by 30% from 2000 to 2016.
   Purpose: To assess the benefits and harms of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions to prevent suicide and reduce suicide behaviors in at-risk adults.
   Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and other databases from November 2011 through May 2018.
   Study Selection: Systematic reviews (SRs) and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed nonpharmacologic or pharmacologic therapies for adults at risk for suicide.
   Data Extraction: One investigator abstracted data and assessed study quality, and a second investigator checked abstractions and assessments for accuracy.
   Data Synthesis: Eight SRs and 15 RCTs were included. The evidence for psychological interventions suggests that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) reduces suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, and hopelessness compared with treatment as usual (TAU). Limited evidence suggests that dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) reduces suicidal ideation compared with wait-list control or crisis planning. The evidence for pharmacologic treatments suggests that ketamine reduces suicidal ideation with minimal adverse events compared with placebo or midazolam. Lithium reduces rates of suicide among patients with unipolar or bipolar mood disorders compared with placebo. However, no differences were observed between lithium and other medications in reducing suicide.
   Limitation: Qualitative synthesis of new evidence with existing meta-analyses, methodological shortcomings of studies, heterogeneity of nonpharmacologic interventions, and limited evidence for pharmacologic treatments and harms.
   Conclusion: Both CBT and DBT showed modest benefit in reducing suicidal ideation compared with TAU or wait-list control, and CBT also reduced suicide attempts compared with TAU. Ketamine and lithium reduced the rate of suicide compared with placebo, but there was limited information on harms. Limited data are available to support the efficacy of other nonpharmacologic or pharmacologic interventions.

AB The goals of the study were (1) to determine the association between parental and offspring suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among adult offspring in a general community sample, and (2) to examine the extent to which this association can be explained by mediating processes of mental disorders. Data were drawn from the National Comorbidity Survey (n = 8098), a representative household sample of adults aged 15-54 in the United States. The relationships between suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among adult offspring and suicidal ideation and suicide attempt in their parents, compared with those in parents not characterized by suicidal ideation or suicide attempts, were calculated using multiple logistic regression analyses. Analyses were adjusted for differences in sociodemographic characteristics and for mental disorders. Results showed that parental suicidal ideation was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of suicidal ideation [OR = 1.7 (1.2, 2.5)] and suicide attempt [OR = 1.4 (0.9, 2.1)] among offspring. Parental suicide attempt was associated with increased odds of suicidal ideation [OR = 2.0 (1.4, 2.9)] and suicide attempt [OR = 2.2 (1.4, 3.4)] among offspring. Comorbid mental disorders contributed to the strength of these associations, but with the exception of the link between parental suicidal ideation and offspring suicide attempt, all remained statistically significant even after adjustment. These data provide initial evidence of familial linkages (parent-offspring) of suicidal ideation and behavior among a sample of adults representative of the US population. The data suggest that comorbid mental disorders contribute to these associations but do not completely account for them. The findings are consistent with and extend results from family, clinical, and high-risk studies suggesting that a familial risk of suicidal ideation and suicide behavior occurs in the general population. Implications for prevention and future research are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: Previous studies have reported that psychological and social distresses associated with a cancer diagnosis have led to an increase in suicides compared to the general population. We sought to explore lung cancer-associated suicide rates in a large national database compared to the general population, and to the three most prevalent non-skin cancers [breast, prostate and colorectal cancer (CRC)].
   Methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database (1973-2013) was retrospectively reviewed to identify cancer-associated suicide deaths in all cancers combined, as well as for each of lung, prostate, breast or CRCs. Suicide incidence and standardised mortality ratio (SMR) were estimated using SEER(star)Stat-8.3.2 program. Suicidal trends over time and timing from cancer diagnosis to suicide were estimated for each cancer type.
   Results: Among 3,640,229 cancer patients, 6,661 committed suicide. The cancer-associated suicide rate was 27.5/100,000 person years (SMR = 1.57). The highest suicide risk was observed in patients with lung cancer (SMR = 4.17) followed by CRC (SMR = 1.41), breast cancer (SMR = 1.40) and prostate cancer (SMR = 1.18).
   Median time to suicide was 7 months in lung cancer, 56 months in prostate cancer, 52 months in breast cancer and 37 months in CRC (p < 0.001).
   We noticed a decreasing trend in suicide SMR over time, which is most notable for lung cancer compared to the other three cancers. In lung cancer, suicide SMR was higher in elderly patients (70-75 years; SMR = 12), males (SMR = 8.8), Asians (SMR = 13.7), widowed patients (SMR = 11.6), undifferentiated tumours (SMR = 8.6), small-cell lung cancer (SMR = 11.2) or metastatic disease (SMR = 13.9) and in patients who refused surgery (SMR = 13).
   Conclusion: The cancer-associated suicide rate is nearly twice that of the general population of the United States of America. The suicide risk is highest among the patients with lung cancer, particularly elderly, widowed, male patients and patients with unfavourable tumour characteristics. The identification of high-risk patients is of extreme importance to provide proper psychological assessment, support and counselling to reduce these rates.

AB Ongoing discussion of potential benefits and risks of antidepressant treatment with respect to suicidal behaviors includes many ecological, or population-based, correlational studies of temporal or regional trends in suicide rates and rates of usage of modern antidepressants including serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SRIs). Since this body of research has not been compiled and evaluated, we used computerized literature searching to identify 19 relevant published studies. They yielded heterogeneous findings: only 8/19 found significant inverse correlations between rising sales of modern antidepressants in the 1990s and falling suicide rates not anticipated in the 1980s. Average reductions in suicide rates in the 1990s (10.7%) and 1980s (10.0%) differed little in 11 studies with data from both eras. Reduction of suicide rates in the 1990s was unrelated to geographic region, population size, units of analysis, publication year, or growth in antidepressant usage, but was greater with higher initial suicide rates, in men, and in older persons. In the same decade, suicides rates decreased in only half of 79 large countries. Overall, these findings yield limited and inconsistent support for the hypothesis that increased use of modern antidepressants might limit suicide risk, and no evidence that the risk increased. Suicidal risk is determined by complex factors, including access to clinical services, in general, and more comprehensive treatment of depression, in particular. Overall, as with findings from randomized trials and cohort or case-control studies, evidence of specific antisuicidal effects of antidepressant treatment from ecological analyses remains elusive.

AB Objective: This study compares the likelihood of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt across stages of nonmedical prescription opioid use and by presence of prescription opioid disorders (dependence and/or abuse) among adult respondents. Method: In the 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 37,933 adult respondents were asked if they had thought about suicide or had attempted suicide in the past year. The likelihood of ideation and attempt were compared across the following four categories: (a) those who never used prescription opioids, (b) former users, (c) persistent users, and (d) recent-onset users. Weighted multinomial logistic regressions were used to examine if these stages and presence of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria for prescription opioid disorders were associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempt. Results: Five percent of respondents (n = 2,021) reported suicidal ideation; of these, 15% (n = 310) reported attempt. Former and persistent nonmedical prescription opioid users had greater odds of suicidal ideation than those who never used these medications nonmedically. The stages of prescription opioid use were not associated with suicide attempt. Presence of prescription opioid disorders among past-year prescription opioid users was associated with suicidal ideation but not suicide attempt. Conclusions: The risk for suicidal ideation was greater in those who no longer used prescription opioids, in persistent users, and among nonmedical users who had a prescription opioid disorder compared with users without the disorder. The results suggest a need to continue monitoring for suicide risk even among those who have stopped using prescription opioids. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs, 73, 178-184, 2012)

AB This case reports on a first manic episode occurring to a 68 year old patient. Until now this mate patient had been diagnosed with a recurrent depressive disorder. This depressive illness started 29 years ago and was punctuated I by several depressive episodes. During one of these episodes associated to psychotic features, following the lithium discontinuation, the patient committed a homicide-suicide. He was found not to be responsible for his crime and treatment was subsequently restarted. For the next fifteen years the patient was stabilized using the association of antidepressant plus lithium, then lithium alone. Until the current manic episode subsequent to a further lithium discontinuation, the patient thanks to the mood stabilizer, could enjoy a good quality of life with a very satisfying social and professional adjustment. Following the case report, an analysis of published data on epidemiological parameters and risk factors associated was conducted. Findings show that perpetrators of murder suicides are mainly males(> 85%) suffering from depression (40% to 75%). Cases of homicide-suicide more frequently involve individuals committing a violent suicide shortly after (minutes or hours) committing one or more homicides. These cases often occur within a disturbed family context with drugs or alcohol abuse, social or cultural stresses such as poor social level or unemployment being other risk factors. Firearms are the most frequently used in suicides. Reported annual incidence is similar every year, ranging from 0.2 to 0.3 per 100 000 in the United States and other countries. Due to suicide but also to other disorders, mortality and morbidity rates are higher with patients suffering from mood disorders. A long term treatment with lithium results in a decrease of morbidity rate and suicidal risk in the general population.

AB Suicide and suicidal ideation are serious public health concerns. Accurate detection and assessment are critical first steps in addressing this challenging issue. The present study examined self-reported suicidal ideation in a sample of United States Air Force enlisted active duty basic trainees (N = 470) using the Multidimensional Suicide Inventory (MSI-28). Exploratory factor analyses revealed a 4-factor structure for the MSI-28 in this sample. Together, these 4 factors explained approximately 72% of the variance in the MSI-28. The MSI-28 evidenced moderate to strong associations with measures of resilience (Dispositional Resilience Scale-15; DRS-15) and psychological distress (Outcome Questionnaire; OQ-30.2). These findings demonstrate that the MSI-28 is a promising tool for clinical measurement of self-reported suicidality. Future directions for further validation of the MSI-28 are discussed.

   strangulation; Cable tie; Asphyxiation; Hanging
AB In 2006 the US National Vital Statistics Report recorded 33,300 suicides in the United States, of which hanging, strangulation and suffocation combined to account for 7,491 (22.5%) of the cases. Self strangulation by ligature is uncommon and in the majority of cases, scarves, belts, neckties and rope are used. We report three instances where cable ties were secured around the neck in order to commit suicide. All had a history of depression. One was a 37-year-old man who used a belt to complete the act after an unsuccessful attempt to use cable ties. The second was a 63-year old woman who used multiple cable ties to accomplish her goal. In the third case a tensioning tool was used by a 54-year old man to tighten a cable tie around his neck during self strangulation. Utilization of a tool to tighten the cable ties has not previously been reported.

AB P>Background:
   With increasing research suggesting a role of allergy on suicidality, this study, on a population level, delved into how allergy affects risk for suicide completion in the context of mood disorder and other factors.
   Methods:
   Based on the entire population of Denmark, we included 27 096 completed suicides and 467 571 live controls matched on sex and age with a nested case-control design. We retrieved personal information on hospital contacts for allergy and other variables from various Danish longitudinal registries and analyzed the data with conditional logistic regression.
   Results:
   We noted that 1.17% suicide victims, compared with 0.79% matched controls, had a history of hospital contact for allergy and that a history of allergy predicted an increased risk for suicide completion; however, the effect was confined to allergy that led to inpatient treatment (IRR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.41-1.80). The increased risk was attenuated somewhat but remained significant when adjusted for personal psychiatric history and socioeconomic status. Meanwhile, we observed a nonsignificantly stronger effect in women than in men, and a significant age difference with a stronger effect for individuals at high ages. Moreover, we detected a significant interaction between allergy and mood disorder - even an antagonism effect of the two exposures. Allergy increased suicide risk only in persons with no history of mood disorder, whereas it eliminated suicide risk in those with a history of mood disorder.
   Conclusions:
   The findings support a link between allergy and suicidality, with a possible mediating role of mood disorder.

AB Introduction: In this study student suicides are classified as a distinct group in Eskisehir-a city located in the western part of our country and famous as a student city. The study aims at describing demographic and suicide specification of cases and compare some important issues between males and females.
   Method: All the judicially deaths in Eskisehir in a 12 year period between 2004 and 2015 have been evaluated. 75 cases that were deemed as suicide cases as a result of criminal investigation have been included in the study.
   Results: It was determined that hanging method was the most frequently used method and the number of male was more. It was determined that the majority of them were the students living away from their families. Definite or possible psychiatric disorder was identified as the most important risk factor. It was observed that there were significant differences in terms of risk factors between male and female students. Males have been found as more prominent in case of definite or possible psychiatric disorders, alcohol and substance abuse, love and romantic tangles; females have been found as more prominent in case of family problems and social pressure, and repeated suicide attempts.
   Discussion: Compared to the general population love and romantic problems are more prevalent in this group. It is observed that university students left suicide notes more than the general population. Sharing this study with the university administrations could be helpful in undertaking the necessary precautions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine.

AB Background: Prospective cohort studies on biological risk factors of completed suicide are scarce. We aimed to test which biological risk factors independently identify subjects at increased risk of suicidal death.
   Methods: In the prospective cohort of the Seven Countries Study, 5,321 middle-aged men from Finland, Serbia, Italy, and Greece were included. Completed suicide (ICD-8 codes E950-959) was assessed during 40 years of follow-up. Biological cardiovascular risk factors (including forced vital capacity [FVC] and height) were tested for their role as predictors in multivariable Cox models stratified by country.
   Results: There were 4518 deaths during follow-up, with 64 from suicide (1.4%). In univariable models, only FVC and height were strongly inversely related with suicide. Socio-economic status and being unmarried were potential confounders. In multivariable models taking these confounders into account, both a low FVC (0.30 for top vs. lowest quartile: 95% CI: 0.12-0.76: P=0.006 for trend) and a low FVC/height ratio (0.37 for top vs. lowest quartile; 95% CI: 0.17-0.82; P=0.004 for trend) were strongly inversely related with completed suicide.
   Limitations: Information oil proximal causes, such as prior Suicidal ideation, emotional distress and depression, was lacking at baseline.
   Conclusions: Poor respiratory function in middle-aged men was an independent risk factor for completed suicide. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Desire for death is not generally considered a harbinger of more severe suicidal behavior and is not routinely included in suicide research and assessment interviews. We aimed to compare desire for death and suicidal ideation as clinical markers for suicide attempts.
   Methods: Using data from two nationally representative surveys (n = 42,862 and n = 43,093 respectively), we examined whether desire for death predicts suicide attempts. We compared the odds ratio (OR) and "Number Needed to be Exposed for one additional person to be Harmed" [NNEH] for lifetime suicide attempts among those with desire for death but no suicidal ideation; those with suicidal ideation but no desire for death, and those with both desire for death and suicidal ideation, compared to those with neither desire for death nor suicidal ideation.
   Results: The risk for lifetime suicide attempt was similar among those with lifetime desire for death with no suicidal ideation and those with lifetime suicidal ideation with no desire for death. Respondents with both lifetime desire for death and suicidal ideation had the highest risk for lifetime suicide attempts.
   Limitations: Cross-sectional design and self-reported suicidal ideation/attempts are viewed as limitations of this study.
   Conclusions: Querying individuals on desire for death has the same value as assessing suicidal ideation to examine risk for suicide attempt. A combination of desire for death and suicidal ideation is the best predictor for suicide attempts. This is of high clinical relevance since we suggest that desire for death should be included as a potential clinical marker of suicidality in clinical assessments. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI Changes in Scottish suicide rates during the Second World War
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID SOUTHWESTERN CROATIA; UNITED-STATES; WAR
AB Background: It is believed that total reported suicide rates tend to decrease during wartime. However, analysis of suicide rates during recent conflicts suggests a more complex picture, with increases in some age groups and changes in method choice. As few age and gender specific analyses of more distant conflicts have been conducted, it is not clear if these findings reflect a change in the epidemiology of suicide in wartime. Therefore, we examined suicide rates in Scotland before, during and after the Second World War to see if similar features were present.
   Methods: Data on deaths in Scotland recorded as suicide during the period 1931-1952, and population estimates for each of these years, were obtained from the General Register Office for Scotland. Using computer spreadsheets, suicide rates by gender, age and method were calculated. Forward stepwise logistic regression was used to assess the effect of gender, war and year on suicide rates using SAS V8.2.
   Results: The all-age suicide rate among both men and women declined during the period studied. However, when this long-term decline is taken into account, the likelihood of suicide during the Second World War was higher than during both the pre-War and post-War periods. Suicide rates among men aged 15-24 years rose during the Second World War, peaking at 148 per million (41 deaths) during 1942 before declining to 39 per million (10 deaths) by 1945, while the rate among men aged 25-34 years reached 199 per million (43 deaths) during 1943 before falling to 66 per million (23 deaths) by 1946. This was accompanied by an increase in male suicides attributable to firearms and explosives during the War years which decreased following its conclusion.
   Conclusion: All age male and female suicide rates decreased in Scotland during World War II. However, once the general background decrease in suicide rates over the whole period is accounted for, the likelihood of suicide among the entire Scottish population during the Second World War was elevated. The overall decrease in suicide rates concealed large increases in younger male age groups during the War years, and an increase in male suicides recorded as due to the use of firearms. We conclude that the effects of war on younger people, reported in recent conflicts in Central Europe, were also seen in Scotland during the Second World War. The results support the findings of studies of recent conflicts which have found a heterogeneous picture with respect to age specific suicide rates during wartime.

A research was made from articles and reviews published between 2005-2015 in PsycINFO, Medline, Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, and SciELO. Thanks to it, we retrieved 5,222 records which were analysed against the inclusion (e.g., any design of the study, published in English or Spanish) and quality criteria, including 53 studies in the review. In these results it is noticeable how men (36% of the studies) and elderly (28% of the studies) commit suicide more frequently. Women (30% of the studies) and young people (17% of the studies) have more attempts and suicidal behaviour. The most commonly used methods among them include hanging (24% of the studies), firearm (17% of the studies), and precipitation (6% of the studies); unemployment (17% of the studies), rural life (9% of the studies), a marital status other than marriage (15% of the studies), and low education (23% of the studies) are also closely associated with both suicide and suicidal behaviour. Consequently, important connections can be concluded when carrying out psychological autopsies, which should be taken into account due to their clear implications in personal and material damage that must be elucidated judicially, clarifying the specific occurrence as suicide, homicide, or accident.

AB This study reports descriptive data assessing the prevalence of various risk factors and associations among pregnancy-related death by unnatural causes (PRUD), namely suicide, homicide and accidental causes in the city of Las Vegas. In 7215 women referred for autopsy, results showed PRUD 0.1% (n = 37) was more common in the Caucasian race 45.9% (n = 17), and ages 20-30 years 43.2% (n = 16). We also identified high prevalence of mental illness 51.3% (n = 19) and low prenatal care 37.8% (n = 14), particularly in our suicide cohort 100.0% (n = 13), and 15.3% (n = 2) respectively. Our study demonstrates the first investigation to identify the relationship between mental illness, particularly mood and substance disorders with pregnancy-related unnatural death.

AB Objective: The purpose of this paper was to provide a clinical review of the literature on the relation of alcoholism to suicidal behavior.
   Method: Studies of alcoholism and suicidal behavior available in MEDLINE. Institute for Scientific Information Databases (Science Citation Index Expanded., Social Sciences Citation Index, and Arts & Humanities Citation Index), EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were identified and reviewed.
   Results: Alcoholism is associated with a considerable risk of suicidal behavior. Individuals with alcoholism who attempt or complete suicide are characterized by major depressive episodes, stressful life events, particularly interpersonal difficulties, poor social support, living alone, high aggression/impulsivity, negative affect, hopelessness, severe alcoholism. comorbid substance, especially cocaine abuse, serious medical illness, suicidal communication, and prior suicidal behavior. Partner-relationship disruptions are strongly associated with suicidal behavior in individuals with alcoholism.
   Conclusion: All individuals with alcoholism should receive a suicide risk assessment based on known risk factors.

TI Effects of Psychiatric Disorders on Suicide Attempt: Similarities and
   Differences Between Older and Younger Adults in a National Cohort Study

DT Article
ID INTERVIEW SCHEDULE AUDADIS; ALCOHOL-USE DISORDER; MENTAL-DISORDERS;

   COMORBIDITY
AB Objective: Several common psychiatric disorders are associated with increased risk of suicide attempts, and the strength of these associations may vary between younger and older adults, which may explain age differences in suicide risk. Because psychiatric disorders often co-occur, it remains unclear whether (1) the risk of suicide attempt in older and younger adults is due to specific psychiatric disorders or underlying psychopathology dimensions (ie, internalizing and externalizing dimensions) and (2) the extent to which individual psychiatric disorders make distinct contributions to suicide attempt risk varies by age.
   Methods: In a large nationally representative longitudinal survey, the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC; Wave 1, 2001-2002; Wave 2, 2004-2005), multiple-group structural equation modeling was used to examine shared and specific effects of DSM-IV-TR Axis I and Axis II disorders on the 3-year occurrence of suicide attempts in 4 different age groups (18-30 years, 31-40 years, 41-49 years, and >= 50 years).
   Results: The study population included 34,653 individuals. In each age group, effect of psychiatric disorders on risk of attempting suicide was almost exclusively mediated through a general psychopathology factor representing the shared effect across all disorders (P < .01). The magnitude of this effect was significantly lower in older than in younger adults (P < .05). No individual disorder had significant additional effects on attempt risk.
   Conclusions: These findings underscore the importance of assessing suicide attempt risk in patients at all ages who present with common psychiatric disorders and the need for prevention strategies focused on the general psychopathology dimension.

AB Introduction: In Tunisia, few data are available about self-immolation epidemiology especially in the absence of official statistics on suicides. The aim of our study was to analyze the trends of suicide by self-immolation over a period of ten years (2005-2014).
   Methods: We conducted a descriptive, retrospective study including all the cases of self immolation suicides that occurred over a period of 10 years (2005-2014) and autopsied in the Department of Legal Medicine of the Charles Nicolle Hospital of Tunis, including self immolation occurring in Northern Tunisia as well as those committed in remaining governorates and transferred before death to the central intensive care unit of burnt in Tunis receiving patients from all over Tunisia (about 80% of cases occurring in Tunisia).
   Results: 235 cases of self-immolation were collected. The average age at death was 34.1 +/- 12.43 years (range 14-83 years). Gender ratio was of 3.27. Psychiatric history was mentioned in 32.8% of cases, represented by schizophrenia in 17.9% and depression in 12.3% of cases. 12.3% had a history of suicide attempts, and 7.3% presented a history of suicidal threats. The number of casualties of suicide by self-immolation tripled after 2011 with a rising trend during the next three years and slight drop in 2014. The most reported reason in our study was decompensation of a psychiatric illness (24.7%). Self-immolation occurred most frequently in a private home (34.5%) or a public place (30.2).
   Conclusion: Our study showed that self-immolation affects essentially, young men, who are unemployed and mostly having mental diseases. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Screening children for suicide risk when they present to the emergency department (ED) with nonpsychiatric complaints could lead to better identification and treatment of high-risk youth. Before suicide screening protocols can be implemented for nonpsychiatric patients in pediatric EDs, it is essential to determine whether such efforts are feasible.
   Methods: As part of an instrument validation study, ED patients (10-21 years old) with both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric presenting complaints were recruited to take part in suicide screening. Clinically significant suicidal thoughts, as measured by the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire, and suicidal behaviors were assessed, as well as patient opinions about suicide screening. Recruitment rates for the study as well as impact on length of stay were assessed.
   Results: Of the 266 patients and parents approached for the study, 159 (60%) agreed to participate. For patients entering the ED for nonpsychiatric reasons (n = 106), 5.7% (n = 6) reported previous suicidal behavior, and 5.7% (n = 6) reported clinically significant suicidal ideation. There were no significant differences for mean length of stay in the ED for nonpsychiatric patients with positive triggers and those who screened negative (means, 382 [SD, 198] and 393 [SD, 166] minutes, respectively; P = 0.80). Ninety-six percent of participants agreed that suicide screening should occur in the ED.
   Conclusions: Suicide screening of nonpsychiatric patients in the ED is feasible in terms of acceptability to parents, prevalence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, practicality to ED flow, and patient opinion. Future endeavors should address brief screening tools validated on nonpsychiatric populations.

AB The relatively new practice of continuous sedation at the end of life (CS) is increasingly being debated in the clinical and ethical literature. This practice received much attention when a U.S. Supreme Court ruling noted that the availability of CS made legalization of physician-assisted suicide (PAS) unnecessary, as CS could alleviate even the most severe suffering. This view has been widely adopted. In this article, we perform an in-depth analysis of four versions of this oargument of preferable alternative.o Our goal is to determine the extent to which CS can be considered to be an alternative to PAS and to identify the grounds, if any, on which CS may be ethically preferable to PAS.

However, little research has investigated the concomitant effect of comorbid psychiatric disorders on suicide mortality. This study aimed to investigate the effect of comorbid AUD on suicide mortality of individuals with another psychiatric disorder using a national data sample.
   MethodsWe used the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort data from 2002 to 2013. We selected individuals with specific psychiatric disorders based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (F10-F48). Overall, the study included 741,601 participants. We utilized a prioritization process to identify the primary diagnosis for those with multiple diagnoses. All-cause mortality rates and suicide rates per 100,000 person-year (days) and the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) were calculated. Then, we compared the suicide-specific SMR of 3 different groups: (i) specific psychiatric disorder versus general public; (ii) specific psychiatric disorder comorbid with AUD versus general public; and (iii) specific psychiatric disorder comorbid with AUD versus specific psychiatric disorder without comorbid AUD.
   ResultsPatients with any specific psychiatric disorder showed higher suicide-specific SMR compared to the general population. Being comorbid with AUD further increased the risk of suicide among psychiatric patients. In particular, patients with bipolar affective disorders, organic mental disorders, or depressive disorders comorbid with AUD had about 2 to 4 times higher suicide-specific SMR compared to those without AUD (bipolar affective disorder: SMR=3.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.49, 4.54]; organic mental disorder: SMR=3.43, 95% CI [1.05, 5.81]; depressive disorder: SMR=2.06, 95% CI [1.52, 2.61]).
   ConclusionsOur data indicate that having a psychiatric disorder increases the risk of committing suicide. More importantly, comorbid AUD further increases this risk of suicidal death for certain psychiatric disorders. This shows the importance of determining whether patients with psychiatric disorders have comorbid AUD to prevent suicide.

AB Background: Suicide is a major public health problem. Current thinking about suicide emphasizes the study of psychiatric, psychological, or biological determinants. Previous work in this area has largely relied on surrogate outcomes or samples enriched for psychiatric morbidity.
   Objective: To evaluate the relationship between social integration and suicide mortality.
   Design: Prospective cohort study initiated in 1988.
   Setting: United States.
   Participants: 34 901 men aged 40 to 75 years.
   Measurements: Social integration was measured with a 7-item index that included marital status, social network size, frequency of contact, religious participation, and participation in other social groups. Vital status of study participants was ascertained through 1 February 2012. The primary outcome of interest was suicide mortality, defined as deaths classified with codes E950 to E959 from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision.
   Results: Over 708 945 person-years of follow-up, there were 147 suicides. The incidence of suicide decreased with increasing social integration. In a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model, the relative hazard of suicide was lowest among participants in the highest (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 0.41 [95% CI, 0.24 to 0.69]) and second-highest (AHR, 0.52 [CI, 0.30 to 0.91]) categories of social integration. Three components (marital status, social network size, and religious service attendance) showed the strongest protective associations. Social integration was also inversely associated with all-cause and cardiovascular-related mortality, but accounting for competing causes of death did not substantively alter the findings.
   Limitations: The study lacked information on participants' mental well-being. Some suicides could have been misclassified as accidental deaths.
   Conclusion: Men who were socially well-integrated had a more than 2-fold reduced risk for suicide over 24 years of follow-up.

AB Background and Methods: The characteristics and frequency of clinical problems with the performance of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are uncertain. We analyzed data from two studies of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in the Netherlands (one conducted in 1990 and 1991 and the other in 1995 and 1996), with a total of 649 cases. We categorized clinical problems as technical problems, such as difficulty inserting an intravenous line; complications, such as myoclonus or vomiting; or problems with completion, such as a longer-than-expected interval between the administration of medications and death.
   Results: In 114 cases, the physician's intention was to provide assistance with suicide, and in 535, the intention was to perform euthanasia. Problems of any type were more frequent in cases of assisted suicide than in cases of euthanasia. Complications occurred in 7 percent of cases of assisted suicide, and problems with completion (a longer-than-expected time to death, failure to induce coma, or induction of coma followed by awakening of the patient) occurred in 16 percent of the cases; complications and problems with completion occurred in 3 percent and 6 percent of cases of euthanasia, respectively. The physician decided to administer a lethal medication in 21 of the cases of assisted suicide (18 percent), which thus became cases of euthanasia. The reasons for this decision included problems with completion (in 12 cases) and the inability of the patient to take all the medications (in 5).
   Conclusions: There may be clinical problems with the performance of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. In the Netherlands, physicians who intend to provide assistance with suicide sometimes end up administering a lethal medication themselves because of the patient's inability to take the medication or because of problems with the completion of physician-assisted suicide.

ID MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; METHIONINE
AB The treatment of major depressive disorder continues to be challenging in many cases. The high nonresponse rates as well as the poor tolerability of some antidepressants often prompt patients to seek other forms of treatment. S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe) is one of the most popular over-the-counter antidepressants currently sold in the United States. SAMe's antidepressant effect has been clearly demonstrated, but safety and tolerability remain understudied at this time. This report describes the case of a 61-year-old woman with no previous history of suicidal ideations who self-prescribed SAMe for her depressive symptoms and attempted suicide 4 days later by burning herself. Given the rise in the use of over-the-counter antidepressants, further research should be performed regarding the safety of these products, including a need for warnings to the public and adequate labels if necessary.

AB One in five adolescents in the United States has engaged in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), one in eight have had serious thoughts of suicide, and one in 25 have attempted suicide. Research suggests that NSSI may increase risk for suicide attempt, yet little is known about the relationship between NSSI and suicidal ideation or attempts. In a primary care setting, 1,561 youth aged 14-24years completed a brief, comprehensive, mental health screen as part of a routine well visit to determine which factors were most likely to predict suicidal ideation and attempt among youth engaging in NSSI. Results of recursive partitioning revealed that current depression and history of alcohol use best differentiated youth engaging in NSSI with low versus high risk for suicidal ideation and attempts. This simple algorithm is presented as a clinical screening tool that might aid medical providers in determining which youth would benefit from more intensive assessment and intervention.

AB Hydrocarbon inhalation is seldom chosen as a means to commit suicide. This practice is exclusively a prerogative of the prison population; it is, however, only exceptionally found in this environment. The two cases of lethal inhalation of propane/butane gas observed by us over a very short time occurred in this context. Toxicologic analyses were performed by means of gas chromatography (head space) and revealed a propane/butane mixture in all specimens (heart blood, bile, and urine) except vitreous humor. Although fatal arrhythmia posthydrocarbon gas abuse is well known, the concentrations of the two hydrocarbons were sufficient to induce death by asphyxiation and were distributed (fairly) homogeneously in all biological fluids and organs examined, a parameter permitting one to assume that death occurred within a relatively short period of time. The absence of finding in vitreous humor and the trace amount in urine suggests that both men died very quickly.

AB Suicide, violence, and unintentional injury have many risk factors in common, such as stress, emotional illness, and substance abuse, among others. Unfortunately, commanders and supervisors may be inadvertently overlooking behavioral risks military personnel engage in. Behavioral health force protection is defined as guarding military personnel from injury comprehensively by identifying shared risk factors and implementing protective factors. This approach broadens the arena of preventive health by addressing unintentional injuries, which may be overlooked as preventable. This paper highlights the relevance of clinicians, commanders, and supervisors being attentive to shared risk factors in the etiology of injury along a continuum encompassing suicide, unintentional injury, and violence. Leadership responsibility is discussed in the context of a military community network that provides a framework of support from both within the unit and external helping agencies as well.

AB At the end of the 19(th) century, male suicide rates in Switzerland were as high as the respective rates in recent decades, whereas female suicide rates were distinctly lower. An age-period-cohort analysis was performed to provide more information about the gender-specific changes over the last century. Suicide mortality has been reported in Switzerland since 1876 when the standardised registration of mortality data began. The analysed data cover the period 1881-2000. The statistical analyses were based on log-linear models and data aggregated by 10-year age-intervals and 10-year period-intervals. The results indicate similar age and period effects in males and females. The estimates representing age-specific risk increase steadily with age, with intermediate plateaus in the 20s and the 50s. The period-specific estimates follow the economic cycles. The birth cohort effects are stronger in males and weaker in females. In the males' estimates, there is a peak in cohorts born around 1840 and a low in cohorts born some 60-100 years later. The estimates increased again in generations born after World War II. In females, the birth cohort estimates are low in cohorts born in the first half of the 19(th) century and increase until the first half of the 20(th) century. Birth cohort effects remain an intriguing topic in epidemiology of suicide. A better understanding of birth cohort effects might open new doors to suicide prevention.

   Results: Risk of suicide by burning is highest between 30 and 59 years (odds by decile of age compared to 18-29 years, 1.47 to 1.82), whereas risk by all methods is highest for ages 70 and older (odds, 1.26 to 1.55). Of patients admitted to burn centers with large self-inflicted burns (total body surface area >= 20%),58.6% live. Among those with specified psychiatric or substance abuse/dependence disorders, 69.2% had either a disorder that included psychosis and/or a substance abuse/dependence disorder.
   Conclusions: Age patterns of suicide by burning suggest that psychotic and/or substance-related disorders may be present in a substantial proportion of victims. Further research is needed, however, to document the psychiatric characteristics of these patients. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Asthma and suicidal ideation with and without suicide attempts among

AB Background: Evidence of a respiratory diseases and suicidal ideation and suicide attempts link exists. To improve our understanding of the mechanism underlying these links, there is a need for examination of the relationship between specific respiratory disease, such as asthma, and suicidal ideation and behavior. In addition, studies need to examine many common risk factors that may play a role in the association between asthma and suicidal ideation and suicide behavior.
   Objective: To examine the association between asthma and suicidal ideation with and without attempts among adults in the United States, specifically investigating the role of cigarette smoking, nicotine dependence, depression, anxiety, and alcohol abuse.
   Methods: Data on 5,692 individuals 18 years and older were drawn from the US National Comorbidity Survey Replication. Descriptive and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the study objectives.
   Results: The estimates of lifetime prevalence for suicidal ideation without and with attempts and asthma were 8.7%, 4.2%, and 12.0%, respectively. Being a woman, a current smoker, depressed, anxious, an alcohol abuser, or nicotine dependent increased the likelihood of suicidal ideation with attempts and asthma. Asthma was significantly (P < .001) associated with suicidal ideation with but not without attempts. Adjustment for smoking, nicotine dependence, age, sex, and race/ethnicity decreased the association between asthma and suicidal ideation with attempts by 16%. Similarly, adjustment for depression, panic disorder, and alcohol abuse led to a 12.4% decrease in this relationship. Despite these adjustments, independently or combined, a statistically significant (P = .02) association remained between asthma and suicidal ideation with attempts.
   Conclusions: Cigarette smoking and concurrent mental health conditions may independently account for significant proportions of the association between asthma and suicidal ideation with attempts. More research is needed to further elucidate the mechanism of the remaining association between asthma and suicide attempts. Modification of smoking behaviors and effective treatment of depression, anxiety, alcohol abuse, and possibly asthma are important suicide prevention strategies.

AB Although studies have investigated and found physical teen dating violence (TDV) has a significant negative impact on mental health outcomes, few studies are yet to investigate the effect of physical TDV on suicidal behaviors among adolescents. The objectives of this study are to examine the prevalence of physical TDV, suicidal ideation, suicide plan, and suicide attempt among adolescents aged 14 to 18 years and the association between physical TDV and these suicidal behaviors. Data for this study were obtained from the 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey. A sample of 9,693 adolescents aged 14 to 18 years (50.4% males) was analyzed using logistic regression with suicidal ideation, suicide plan, and suicide attempt as outcome variables and physical TDV as the main explanatory variable. About 17% of the adolescent students experienced suicidal ideation, 13.7% made a suicide plan, and 7.6% attempted suicide during the past 12 months. Among those who were dating, 9.9% experienced physical TDV. In the multivariate logistic regression, adolescent students who experienced physical TDV were 1.92 times more likely to have experienced suicidal ideation, 1.67 times more likely to have made a suicide plan, and 2.42 times more likely to have attempted suicide during the past 12 months when compared with their counterparts who were dating but experienced no physical TDV. Other significant predictors of suicidal behaviors include being a sexual minority, experiencing forced sex, bullying, feeling sad or hopeless, and binge drinking. Having sufficient sleep lowered the odds of suicidal ideation and suicide plan. The topic of physical TDV and its association with suicidal behaviors among adolescents is such an important issue for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners in the United States and around the world. Prevention and intervention efforts should be culturally tailored to reflect the unique experiences with physical TDV and suicide among minority populations such as sexual minority adolescents.

AB Drug use disorders (DUDs) are highly prevalent in body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), but motives for illicit drug use in BDD have not yet been explored. This study examined motives for drug use and clinical correlates of drug use motives in a sample of individuals with BDD and lifetime drug use, using the Drug Use Motives Questionnaire and 3 additional body image-specific drug use motives. As predicted, the Drug Use Motives Questionnaire coping motive was positively associated with attempted suicide and a lifetime DUD. All 3 body image-specific motives for drug use were also significantly associated with a lifetime DUD. In addition, they were the only variables that were significantly associated with greater severity of BDD. These results build on previous evidence suggesting that coping motives are related to problematic substance use and suicide attempts in BDD.

AB This article is concerned with the differential impact of real pecuniary prices and youth access laws on the smoking behavior among depressed and suicidal youth. Previous cross-sectional research on adolescents has a found a strong positive relationship between cigarette-smoking and depression. This article attempts to fill a void in this literature by examining the economic determinants of cigarette demand among high school students in the United States who exhibit depressive symptoms. The data for this study were extracted from 1991, 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999 and 2001 National School-Based Risk Behavior surveys of high school students conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The overall price elasticity of demand was -0.899 for youths who had suicidal thoughts, -0.837 for youths who had planned suicide and -0.162 for youths who had attempted suicide. These estimates tend to be less elastic than elasticity estimates for non-suicidal youth.

AB OBJECTIVES: To determine if racial and ethnic subgroups of adolescents are at high risk for engagement in suicidal behaviors. METHODS: Using the nationally representative school-based Youth Risk Behavior Survey from the years 1991 to 2017, we conducted logistic regression analyses to examine trends by different racial and ethnic groups, with each suicide indicator serving as a dichotomous outcome. Participants included 198 540 high school students. RESULTS: Across all sex and race and ethnic groups, there were significant linear decreases in self-reported suicidal ideation and suicide plans from 1991 to 2017. Female adolescents (odds ratio [OR], 0.98; P < .001) had significant decreases in attempts over time. Black adolescents had positive linear trends for suicide attempts among both boys (OR, 1.04; P < .001) and girls (OR, 1.02; P = .003). Black adolescent boys (OR, 1.04; P = .048) had a significant linear increase in injury by attempt. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that, over time, black youth have experienced an increase in suicide attempts, which is troubling because attempts are the most prominent risk factor associated with suicide death. For black boys, a significant increase in injury by attempt occurred, which suggests that black boys may be engaging in increasingly lethal means when attempting suicide. Examining trends of suicidal thoughts and behaviors over time by sex and race and ethnicity allow us to determine where to focus prevention and intervention efforts. Future research should examine the underlying reasons for these changes observed in US high school students.

AB Men's suicide rates may be influenced by difficulties recognizing externalizing depressive symptoms in men that adhere to hegemonic masculine gender role norms. The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of externalizing depressive symptoms, internalizing depressive symptoms, and hegemonic masculinity in predicting the existence and severity of suicidal ideation. Homeless men (n = 94) completed questionnaires at a resource center in the Rocky Mountain Western United States. Internalizing symptoms predicted the existence of suicidal ideation, and both externalizing and internalizing symptoms predicted increased severity of suicidal ideation. The masculine norms violence and playboy were correlated with men's suicidal ideation. An externalizing-internalizing model of predicting suicide in men and men's adherence to certain masculine gender role norms may be valuable to further efforts in suicide assessment and prevention.

AB The objective of the study is to evaluate temporal trends, gender effects and methods of completed suicide amongst children and adolescent (aged 10-17) when compared with temporal trends of deaths from other causes. Data were extracted from the Italian Mortality Database, which is collected by the Italian National Census Bureau (ISTAT) and processed by the Statistics Unit of National Centre for Epidemiology, Surveillance and Health Promotion (CNESPS) at the National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di SanitA ). A total of 1,871 children and adolescents, age 10-17 years, committed suicide in Italy from 1971 to 2003 and 109 died by suicide during the last 3-year period of observation (2006-2008). The average suicide rate over the entire period of observation was 0.91 per 100,000; the rate was 1.21 for males and 0.59 for females. During the study period, the general mortality of children and adolescents, age 10-17 years, decreased dramatically, the average annual percentage change decrease was of -3.3% (95% CI -4.4 to -1.9) for males and -2.9% (95% IC -4.4 to -2.5) for females. The decrease was observed, for both genders, for all causes of deaths except suicide. For males, the most frequent method was hanging (54.5%), followed by shooting/fire arms (19.6%), falls/jumping from high places (12.7%); for females, the most frequent method, jumping from high places/falls, accounted for 35.7% of suicides during the whole study period. In conclusion, this study highlights that over the course of several decades suicide is a far less preventable cause of death as compared to other causes of death amongst children and adolescents. Our study demonstrated that suicide rates in adolescents are not a stable phenomenon over the 40 years period of study. It suggested that rates for males and females differed and varied in different ways during specific time periods of this study. National suicide prevention actions should parallel prevention measures implemented to reduce other causes of death.

AB The objective of this study was to provide an updated review of the magnitude of the relationship between alcohol use and suicidal behaviour at the individual and the population level. Systematic literature searches retrieved 14 reviews of individual level studies and 16 primary population level studies. Alcohol abuse and alcohol intoxication are often present in suicidal behaviour; risk of suicide is elevated in alcohol abusers and increasing population drinking tends to be associated with increase in suicide rates. Estimated magnitude of the relationship differs for men and women and it varies at the population level across cultures with different drinking pattern. These variations probably reflect gender differences and cultural variation in drinking behavior generally. Empirical evidence for a causal relationship is still urgently needed.

AB There are now 24 antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) approved for use in epilepsy in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration. A literature search was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google for all English-language articles that discuss newly approved AEDs and the use of AEDs in epilepsy in the United States from January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2011. Five new agents were identified that have come onto the market within the past 2 years. Moreover, 3 trends involving AEDs have become clinically important and must be considered by all who treat patients with epilepsy. These trends include issues of generic substitution of AEDs, pharmacogenomics predicting serious adverse events in certain ethnic populations, and the issue of the suicide risk involving the entire class of AEDs. This article disdisses the most recent AEDs approved for use in the United States and the 3 important trends shaping the modern medical management of epilepsy.

AB The aim of this study was to identify anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation disparities among Chinese Americans and how immigration-related factors affected the outcomes. We tried to explain the differences as a function of the Chinese culture. Data were derived from the National Latino and Asian American Study, the first national epidemiological survey of these populations in the United States. We used only the Chinese sample (N = 600) and focused on depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and suicidal ideation. The United States-born Chinese and those Chinese who immigrated to the United States at 18 years or younger were at higher risk for lifetime depressive or anxiety disorders or suicidal ideation than were their China-born counterparts who arrived in the country at or after 18 years of age. For Chinese Americans, immigration-related factors were associated with depression and anxiety disorders and suicidal ideation. The higher prevalence of these disorders might be attributed to the psychological strains experienced by those who are at higher risk of cultural conflicts.

AB Background: Care-dependency constitutes an important issue with regard to the approval of end-of-life decisions, yet attitudes towards assisted suicide and euthanasia are understudied among care-dependent older adults. We assessed attitudes towards assisted suicide and euthanasia and tested empirical correlates, including socio-demographics, religiosity, physical illness, psychological distress and social isolation.
   Methods: A nationwide cross-sectional survey among older care allowance recipients (50+) in private households in Austria was conducted in 2016. In computer-assisted personal interviews, 493 respondents were asked whether or not they approved of the availability of assisted suicide and euthanasia in case of long-term care dependency and whether or not they would consider using assisted suicide or euthanasia for themselves. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to assess the impact of potential determinants of attitudes towards assisted suicide and euthanasia.
   Results: About a quarter (24.8-26.0%) of the sampled care-dependent older adults approved of the availability of assisted suicide and euthanasia respectively indicated the will to (hypothetically) make use of assisted suicide or euthanasia. Attitudes towards assisted suicide were most favourable among care-dependent older adults living in urban areas, those who did not trust physicians, those who reported active suicide ideation, and individuals with a strong fear of dying. With regard to euthanasia, living alone, religiosity and fear of dying were the central determinants of acceptance.
   Conclusions: Positive attitudes towards and will to (hypothetically) use assisted suicide and euthanasia were expressed by a substantial minority of care-dependent older adults in Austria and are driven by current psychological suffering and fear of the process of dying in the (near) future. Community-based psychosocial care should be expanded to address psychological distress and fears about end-of-life issues among care-dependent older adults.

SO JOURNAL OF RISK AND INSURANCE
LA English
DT Article
ID GUN OWNERSHIP; HOMICIDE; SUICIDE; RATES; REGULATIONS; HANDGUN; RISKS;
   CRIME
AB The United States remains far behind most other affluent countries in terms of life expectancy. One of the possible causes of this life expectancy gap is the widespread availability of firearms and the resulting high number of U.S. firearm fatalities: 10,801 homicides in 2000. The European Union experienced 1,260 homicides, Japan only 22. Using multiple decrement techniques, I show that firearm violence shortens the life of an average American by 104 days (151 days for white males, 362 days for black males). Among all fatal injuries, only motor vehicle accidents have a stronger effect. I estimate that the elimination of all firearm deaths in the United States would increase the male life expectancy more than the total eradication of all colon and prostate cancers. My results suggest that the insurance premium increases paid by Americans as a result of firearm violence are probably of the same order of magnitude as the total medical costs due to gunshots or the increased cost of administering the criminal justice system due to gun crime.

SO JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY NURSING
LA English
DT Article
DE Triage; Suicide; Risk assessment; Qualitative methods; Emergency nursing
ID CLINICAL DECISION-MAKING; RISK-ASSESSMENT; CARE
AB Introduction: Screening for suicidality is a critical nursing function at the initial ED encounter. Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, and a substantial percentage of people who die by suicide present for health care in the year before their deaths. The emergency department provides health care professionals with a critical opportunity to identify patients at risk for suicide and intervene appropriately.
   Methods: Qualitative exploratory study using focus-group data. Findings: Effective and accurate suicidality assessment occurs not by asking a single question but also with the assessment of patient behaviors and presentation (appearance, hygiene, etc). When emergency nurses suspected occult suicidality, additional actions (finding private space, keeping patients safe, and passing on information), took priority.
   Discussion: The Joint Commission recommends using clinical judgment tools for the final determination of safety for a patient at suspected risk of suicide, as research findings suggest that a screening tool can identify persons at risk for suicidemore reliably than a clinician's personal judgment. Our participants report that when they assessed suicide risk at triage, itwas usually by asking a single question such as "Do you have thoughts or plans to harm yourself?" and they expressed concern about the effectiveness of doing so. Participants described their efforts to improve suicide screening across the duration of the patient's ED stay through an iterative process of assessment that included further probing and eliciting, evaluating, and reacting to the patient's response.

AB Background: Suicide officially kills approximately 30,000 annually in the United States. Analysis of this leading public health problem is complicated by undercounting. Despite persisting socioeconomic and health disparities, non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics register suicide rates less than half that of non-Hispanic Whites.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study uses multiple cause-of-death data from the US National Center for Health Statistics to assess whether race/ethnicity, psychiatric comorbidity documentation, and other decedent characteristics were associated with differential potential for suicide misclassification. Subjects were 105,946 White, Black, and Hispanic residents aged 15 years and older, dying in the US between 2003 and 2005, whose manner of death was recorded as suicide or injury of undetermined intent. The main outcome measure was the relative odds of potential suicide misclassification, a binary measure of manner of death: injury of undetermined intent (includes misclassified suicides) versus suicide.
   Results: Blacks (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.22-2.57) and Hispanics (1.17, 1.07-1.28) manifested excess potential suicide misclassification relative to Whites. Decedents aged 35-54 (AOR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.84-0.93), 55-74 (0.52, 0.49-0.57), and 75+ years (0.51, 0.46-0.57) showed diminished misclassification potential relative to decedents aged 15-34, while decedents with 0-8 years (1.82, 1.75-1.90) and 9-12 years of education (1.43, 1.40-1.46) showed excess potential relative to the most educated (13+ years). Excess potential suicide misclassification was also apparent for decedents without (AOR, 3.12; 95% CI, 2.78-3.51) versus those with psychiatric comorbidity documented on their death certificates, and for decedents whose mode of injury was "less active" (46.33; 43.32-49.55) versus "more active."
   Conclusions: Data disparities might explain much of the Black-White suicide rate gap, if not the Hispanic-White gap. Ameliorative action would extend from training in death certification to routine use of psychological autopsies in equivocal-manner-of-death cases.

AB This article analyses and compares recent research on Scandinavian physicians' attitudes towards, as well as their practice of, euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. The studies discussed are quite dissimilar in their design, resulting in considerable difficulties as far as comparability is concerned. Such difficulties are common in these fields of research. As an intended contribution to the amendment of future research, we suggest what we take to be detailed and precise definitions of the terms euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide for use internationally. Our definitions, or interpretations, basically draw on the Dutch experience and understanding of these terms. The Dutch approach implies that acts of abstention from life-prolonging treatment, i.e., withholding and withdrawing treatment, and pain and symptom treatment that theoretically could shorten life (including terminal sedation) are to be considered,normal medical practice'. Furthermore, death is seen as having natural causes in all of these acts. That, however, is not the case with euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. When a physician performs either of these acts, he or she is required to state 'unnatural death' in the patient's death certificate. Our conceptual suggestions do not address the ethical status of the various medical decisions that are made with regard to the death of patients; our aim is conceptual clarity only, As far as euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in Scandinavia is concerned, even though comparisons prove difficult, we do think some observations may be made: physicians from Norway, Denmark and Sweden display differences in both attitude and practice concerning these phenomena. Norwegian physicians are most restrictive with regard to attitude. Danish and Swedish physicians display a more liberal attitude, the latter being the most liberal. These findings did not fit the physicians' practice. Danish physicians have performed euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide more often than Norwegian physicians. Swedish physicians, even though they are the most liberal when it comes to attitude, appear never to have performed euthanasia and very seldom physician-assisted suicide.

AB Aim To establish an influence of biometeorological phases on suicide incidence according to age, gender, settlement, week days, months in a year, ways of suicide execution, influence of biometeorologic phases on suicide execution.
   Methods Comparative analysis of the data about suicides (by years, months, week days, settlements, age, gender) obtained by the Police Department in Kragujevac for the 2004-2008 period and everyday biometeorological phases (phase 1 CWD: cyclone, warm, dry; phase 2 CWW: cyclone, warm, wet; phase 3 CWF: cyclone, warm front; phase 4 CCF: cyclone cold front; phase 5 CCW: cyclone, cold, wet; phase 6 CCD: cyclone, cold, dry; phase 7 ACD: anticyclone, cold, dry; phase 8 ACW: anticyclone, cold, wet; phase 9 AWD: anticyclone, warm, dry; phase 10 AWW: anticyclone, warm, wet) in Kragujevac determinated by the Republic Hydrometeorology Institute of Serbia.
   Results In the observed period there were 144 suicides resulting in the incidence rate of 14/100 000/year. The highest number of suicides was noted in 2005 (36), and lowest one in 2007 (24). The most suicide cases happened in January and June (18 in each), and the fewest in August (7). Three quarters occurred in urban areas. Three quarters of victims were males mostly in the age groups 41-45 and 51-55 (11 in each). Females made one quarter of victims and most of them were in the age group 61-65 years (7). Total mean age was 54,66 years. Two thirds of all suicides were executed by hanging (93) (two thirds were among males), one sixth by firearms, with nine tenths of men. The most incidents with significant correlation were in biometheorological phases 4 and 9 (stable sunny weather and sudden impact of weather fronts, with sudden weather changes) (38 in each), which makes over a half of all suicides.
   Conclusion According to the results of this study, it is strongly recommended to monitor everyday biometeorological forecast, and special attention must be paid to all persons with suicide tendencies.

AB Introduction: The purpose of this paper is to describe the trends and patterns of self-inflicted injuries, available from Canadian administrative data between 1979 and 2014/15, in order to inform and improve suicide prevention efforts.
   Methods: Suicide mortality and hospital separation data were retrieved from the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) holdings of Statistics Canada's Canadian Vital Statistics: Death Database (CVS: D) (1979 to 2012); Canadian Socio-Economic Information Management System (CANSIM 2011, 2012); the Hospital Morbidity Database (HMDB) (1994/95 to 2010/11); and the Discharge Abstract Database (2011/12 to 2014/15). Mortality and hospitalization counts and rates were reported by sex, 5-year age groups and method.
   Results: The Canadian suicide rate (males and females combined, all ages, age-sex standardized rate) has decreased from 14.4/100 000 (n = 3355) in 1979 to 10.4/100 000 (n = 3926) in 2012, with an annual percent change (APC) of -1.2% (95% CI: -1.3 to -1.0). However, this trend was not observed in both sexes: female suicide rates stabilized around 1990, while male rates continued declining over time-yet males still accounted for 75.7% of all suicides in 2012. Suffocation (hanging and strangulation) was the primary method of suicide (46.9%) among Canadians of all ages in 2012, followed by poisoning at 23.3%. In the 2014/15 fiscal year, there were 13 438 hospitalizations in Canada (excluding Quebec) associated with self-inflicted injuries-over 3 times the number of suicides. Over time females have displayed consistently higher rates of hospitalization for self-inflicted injury than males, with 63% of the total. Poisoning was reported as the most frequent means of self-inflicted harm in the fiscal year 2014/15, at 86% of all hospitalizations.
   Conclusion: Suicides and self-inflicted injuries continue to be a serious-but preventable-public health problem that requires ongoing surveillance.

AB The objective was to examine changes in temporal trends in suicide mortality in 26 Western countries by retrospective trend analysis of the WHO mortality database on causes of deaths. From 1990 to 2010, there was a median reduction in suicide mortality of 22.7%, ranging from a 46% reduction in Estonia to a 26.2% increase in Romania. Suicide mortality decreased by >= 20% in 15 countries, and the reduction tended to be greater in countries with higher mortality in 1990. In most of the central European countries mortality strongly declined. The median changes in the age groups were -25.3% (range -62.9% to 72.6%) in people aged 15-24 years, -36.9% (-60.5% to 32.4%) in 25-34 years, -3.6% (-57.1% to 92%) in 35-54 years, -12.2% (-37% to 65,7%) in 55-74 years and -16.1% (-54.5% to 166.7%) in >= 75 years. Suicide prevention programs in youths and in the elderly seem to be effective (at least in females for the elderly) and efforts should be pursued in this way. However, suicide mortality of the people aged 35-54 years has increased in half of the studied countries between 1990 and 2010. Public policies should further orientate their efforts toward this population.

DE Suicide; Toxicology; Alcohol drinking; Epidemiology
ID CONSUMPTION; INTOXICATION; DRINKING; IDEATION; DEATHS
AB Purpose: Few studies have compared acute use of alcohol in suicide decedents with that in a nonsuicide group. This study provides the first national analysis of acute use of alcohol before suicide compared with an estimate of acute use of alcohol in a living sample.
   Methods: Pooled 2003-2011 National Violent Death Reporting System data were used to estimate the prevalence of postmortem blood alcohol content positivity (blood alcohol content >0.0 g/dL) and intoxication (blood alcohol content >= 0.08 g/dL). Population estimates of comparable use of alcohol (within the past 48 hours) were based on the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions.
   Results: Compared with the living sample, male and female suicide decedents showed, respectively, a 1.83-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.73-1.93) and 2.40-fold (95% CI, 2.24-2.57) increased risk of alcohol ingestion before their death after age, race/ethnicity, and chronic alcohol problems were controlled. Furthermore, male and female decedents exhibited, respectively, a 6.18-fold (95% CI, 5.57-6.86) and a 10.04-fold (95% CI, 8.67-11.64) increased risk of being intoxicated before their death after confounders were considered.
   Conclusions: The findings underscore the crucial need to include among the essential components of suicide prevention policies programs that minimize the use of alcohol, particularly drinking to intoxication. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Gun Violence, Mental Illness, And Laws That Prohibit Gun Possession:
   Evidence From Two Florida Counties
SO HEALTH AFFAIRS
LA English
DT Article
ID SUICIDE; POLICY
AB Gun violence kills about ninety people every day in the United States, a toll measured in wasted and ruined lives and with an annual economic price tag exceeding $200 billion. Some policy makers suggest that reforming mental health care systems and improving point-of-purchase background checks to keep guns from mentally disturbed people will address the problem. Epidemiological research shows that serious mental illness contributes little to the risk of interpersonal violence but is a strong factor in suicide, which accounts for most firearm fatalities. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of gun restrictions focused on mental illness remains poorly understood. This article examines gun-related suicide and violent crime in people with serious mental illnesses, and whether legal restrictions on firearm sales to people with a history of mental health adjudication are effective in preventing gun violence. Among the study population in two large Florida counties, we found that 62 percent of violent gun crime arrests and 28 percent of gun suicides involved individuals not legally permitted to have a gun at the time. Suggested policy reforms include enacting risk-based gun removal laws and prohibiting guns from people involuntarily detained in short-term psychiatric hospitalizations.

AB Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidal thoughts and behavior often co-occur, representing a growing public health concern. Despite extensive research examining suicidal thoughts and behavior among those who engage in NSSI, there is a lack of research investigating factors that, when considered together, can differentiate individuals along the continuum of suicidal thoughts and behavior (no history, suicidal ideation, suicide plan, suicide attempt). This study sought to address this question using a sample of 1178 college students with NSSI history (68.70% female). Discriminant function analysis was conducted including the following predictors: NSSI characteristics, negative affect difficulties, and behavioral and demographic risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behavior. Results suggest that self-disclosure of suicidal ideation, number of lifetime NSSI methods, NSSI frequency, depressive symptoms, and age most parsimoniously differentiate study groups. Those who use a greater number of NSSI methods and acts, paired with higher depressive symptoms and repeated self-disclosure of suicidal ideation are most likely to have a suicide attempt history; decreases in these variables suggest membership within less severe groups. Furthermore, older age may be related to greater suicidality. Findings suggest that the evaluation and co-occurrence of these variables may contribute to a more accurate suicide risk assessment.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and correlates of attempted suicide among young injection drug users (IDUs) from six study sites in five US cities. Two thousand two hundred and nineteen participants 15-30 years of age underwent interviewer-administered questionnaires relating to self-reported drug use, sociodemographics, suicidal ideation and attempts, and exposure to violence. The 6-month prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts was 35.8% (n = 795) and 7% (n = 156), respectively. Compared to those not reporting a recent (past 6 months) suicide attempt, those attempting suicide were more likely to have a lifetime history of mental health facility admission or sexual abuse. Participants receiving drug treatment at the time of the baseline interview (53.2% versus 37.1%, odds ratio [OR] = 1.93, 95% confidence interval [Cl]: 1.39, 2.67) were also more likely to report a recent attempt; as were those reporting a history of experiencing violence. These associations persisted after adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, study site, and other significant covariates by multiple logistic regression. These data suggest that increased access to drug treatment, community mental health, and violence prevention programs may decrease suicidal behavior among young injection drug users.

AB The review is devoted to the analysis of data on the relationship between smoking and suicide. It is shown that smokers are much more likely to have chronic physical illnesses, mental disorders that can lead to depression and contribute to suicidal attempts. On the other hand, research results indicate that active smoking is associated with suicide and there is a correlation between a larger number of cigarettes smoked per day and higher suicide risks. In multivariate analyzes it was shown that a longer duration of smoking (>= 41 years vs. <= 10 years) was associated with higher suicide risks for men (odds ratio (OR) = 2.26). Quitting smoking was associated with lower suicide risks (OR = 0.37), which decreased with an increase in the duration of abstinence from tobacco. In a large population-based study on a cohort of 16,282 pairs of twins for 35 years, the impact on the suicide risk of the status and intensity of smoking, marital status, employment and socioeconomic status, the presence of mental and physical illnesses and a higher death rate from suicides among smokers, than those who refused to use tobacco or never smoked. The observed association is not associated with living conditions that increase the risk of suicide and not with the development of diseases caused by exposure to toxic components of tobacco smoke, in which depressive disorders that increase the risk of suicide develop. Chronic intoxication with components of tobacco smoke is an additional independent risk factor for suicide, the effect of which decreases with smoking cessation. In a multicenter study of the United States and Finland, an attempt was made to assess the contribution of TC to suicide, regardless of the indices of diagnosed and undiagnosed depression, excessive alcohol consumption, use of antidepressants, unemployment, marital status and other demographic characteristics. The authors believe that smoking increases the risk of suicide by 2.5 times. Smoking changes the changes in serotonergic signaling pathways, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which refers to neurotrophins - substances that stimulate and support the development of neurons. Possible pathogenesis of the effect of smoking on suicidal attempts is discussed: changes in synaptic activity and plasticity, serotonergic signaling pathways, neurotrophic brain factor, dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmitter systems.

AB Objective: Several studies have shown that acute alcohol use is associated with suicidal behavior, but the magnitude and nature of the relationship remain unclear. We report a study on the impact of acute alcohol use on suicide attempts treated in the emergency room (ER) using the case-crossover design. Method: Seven ER studies carried out in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Australia from 1984 to 1996 with probability samples and similar methodology were merged yielding a total of 102 suicide attempters (overall 52% were male and 59% under 30 years of age). Results: Thirty-six patients reported alcohol use within 6 hours prior to the suicide attempt. When usual alcohol consumption during the past 12 months served as the control value, the estimated relative risk (RR) for patients who reported alcohol use within 6 hours prior to the suicide attempt was 9.6 (95% confidence interval: 5.7-16.3). Although the prevalence of alcohol use differed by sex, there was no statistically significant difference in the estimated RRs (RR = 13.6 men and RR = 5.3 women, p = 0.11 for the heterogeneity test). Conclusions: A positive association was found between alcohol use 6 hours prior and suicide attempts in 102 ER cases in four countries. The case-crossover methodology is well suited to studies for which an external control group is not easily obtainable.

AB Although emotion regulation has been identified as a key function of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), it is unclear how specific indices of emotion regulation are associated with particular NSSI methods as markers of risk. This study used latent class analysis (LCA) to identify subgroups of individuals who engage in NSSI and their patterns of emotional regulation difficulties. Undergraduate students in the southeastern United States (N = 326) completed an online survey. LCA was used to identify subgroups of individuals engaging in NSSI and their associated emotion regulation difficulties. These subgroups were then compared across a variety of behavioral health outcomes (e.g. impulsive behavior, disordered eating, problematic alcohol use, suicide attempt history) to characterize specific risk profiles. The LCA revealed four subgroups who engage in NSSI and have specific emotion regulation difficulties. These subgroups were differentially associated with behavioral health outcomes, including suicide risk, disordered eating, and impulsive behavior. Results of this research could aid in clinical identification of at-risk individuals.

AB Objectives: This study sought to describe self-reported barriers to professional help seeking among college students who are at elevated suicide risk and determine if these barriers vary by demographic and clinical characteristics. Participants: Participants were 165 non-treatment seekers recruited as part of a Web-based treatment linkage intervention for college students at elevated suicide risk (from September 2010 through December 2011). Methods: Data were collected using Web-based questionnaires. Two coders coded students' responses to an open-ended question about reasons for not seeking professional help. Results: The most commonly reported barriers included perception that treatment is not needed (66%), lack of time (26.8%), and preference for self-management (18%). Stigma was mentioned by only 12% of students. There were notable differences based on gender, race, and severity of depression and alcohol abuse. Conclusions: Efforts aimed at reaching students at elevated risk for suicidal behavior should be particularly sensitive to these commonly described barriers.

AB Government agencies have issued warnings about the use of antidepressant medications in children, adolescents, and young adults since 2003. The statements warn that such medications may cause de novo 'suicidality' in some people. This review explores the data on the treatment of depression that led to these warnings and subsequent data that are relevant to the warnings. It also addresses the effectiveness of antidepressant treatment in general and the relationship of suicide rates to antidepressant treatment. It concludes that the decisions for the 'black box' warnings were based on biased data and invalid assumptions. Furthermore, the decisions were unsupported by the observational data regarding suicide in young people that existed in 2003. The following recommendations would seem to follow from these observations. First, drug authorities should re-evaluate the basis for their imposed warnings on antidepressant medicines, and analyze the actual public health consequences the warnings have had. In the absence of substantial evidence supporting the warnings, they should be removed. Second, physicians and other providers with prescription privileges should continue to be educated regarding the importance of aggressively treating depression in young people, using antidepressants when indicated. Third, physicians and other professionals who treat depressed young people must always be aware of the risk of suicide (albeit quite low) and observe them closely for any signs of increased risk of suicide. This is necessary regardless of the type of treatment being provided.

   WOMEN; JAIL
AB Objective: To examine factors associated with suicide in prisoners.
   Data Sources: Studies were identified through electronic searches of MEDLINE (1950-February 2007), PsycINFO (1806-February 2007), EMBASE (1974-February 2007), and CINAHL (1982-February 2007) without language restriction using the search terms prison, jail, felon, detainee, penal, and custody combined with suicide.
   Study Selection: Included studies were investigations that reported on prisoners dying by suicide who were compared with prisoners in control groups (which were randomly selected or matched, or consisted of the total or average prison population). Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used to explore sources of heterogeneity.
   Data Synthesis: Thirty-four studies (comprising 4780 cases of prison suicide) were identified for inclusion in the review, of which 12 were based in the United States. Demographic factors associated with suicide included white race/ethnicity (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.7 to 2.2), being male (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.4 to 2.5), and being married (OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.3 to 1.7). Criminological factors included occupation of a single cell (OR = 9.1, 95% CI = 6.1 to 13.5), detainee/remand status (OR = 4.1, 95% CI = 3.5 to 4.8), and serving a life sentence (OR = 3.9, 95% CI = 1.1 to 13.3). Clinical factors were recent suicidal ideation (OR = 15.2, 95% CI = 8.5 to 27.2), history of attempted suicide (OR = 8.4, 95% CI = 6.2 to 11.4), having a current psychiatric diagnosis (OR = 5.9, 95% CI = 2.3 to 15.4), receiving psychotropic medication (OR = 4.2, 95% CI = 2.9 to 6.0), and having a history of alcohol use problems (OR = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.9 to 4.6). Black race/ethnicity was inversely associated with suicide (OR = 0.4, 95% CI = 0.3 to 0.4). Few differences were found in risk estimates when compared by study design or publication type.
   Conclusions: Several demographic, criminological, and clinical factors were found to be associated with suicide in prisoners, the most important being occupation of a single cell, recent suicidal ideation, a history of attempted suicide, and having a psychiatric diagnosis or history of alcohol use problems. As. some of these associations included potentially modifiable environmental and clinical factors, there is scope for targeting these factors in suicide prevention strategies for individuals in custody.

AB In the United States and Europe, the distinction between public mass shooters and suicide terrorists no longer seems particularly meaningful. A number of public mass shooters have considered using bombs and claimed to be sacrificing themselves for an ideological cause, and many suicide terrorists have attacked without organizational support, using firearms, for what appear to be largely personal reasons. Previous research has also documented several common factors in these offenders' lives, including (a) suicidal motives and life indifference, (b) perceived victimization, and (c) desires for attention or fame. These factors are not always easy for observers to recognize in advance, so mental health professionals, the public, and law enforcement officials might need help from experts to more successfully identify at-risk individuals. This article reviews the evidence of each factor, provides a list of specific warning signs, and offers recommendations for future research. Ultimately, an evidence-based approach to prevention could help save both the lives of many potential victims and the lives of the would-be attackers themselves.

AB Objective. In 1997, suicide was the third leading cause of death among 10- to 19-year-olds in the United States, with the greatest increases in suicide rates in the previous decade experienced by black and other minority youth. The purpose of this study was to identify risk and protective factors for suicide attempts among black, Hispanic, and white male and female adolescents.
   Methods. We used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, conducted in 1995 and 1996. A nationally representative sample of 13 110 students in grades 7 through 12 completed 2 in-home interviews, an average of 11 months apart. We examined Time 1 factors at the individual, family, and community level that predicted or protected against Time 2 suicide attempts.
   Results. Perceived parent and family connectedness was protective against suicide attempts for black, Hispanic, and white girls and boys, with odds ratios ranging from 0.06 to 0.32. For girls, emotional well-being was also protective for all of the racial/ethnic groups studied, while a high grade point average was an additional protective factor for all of the boys. Cross-cutting risk factors included previous suicide attempt, violence victimization, violence perpetration, alcohol use, marijuana use, and school problems. Additionally, somatic symptoms, friend suicide attempt or completion, other illicit drug use, and a history of mental health treatment predicted suicide attempts among black, Hispanic, and white females. Weapon-carrying at school and same-sex romantic attraction were predictive for all groups of boys. Calculating the estimated probabilities of attempting suicide for adolescents with increasing numbers of risk and protective factors revealed that the presence of 3 protective factors reduced the risk of a suicide attempt by 70% to 85% for each of the gender and racial/ethnic groups, including those with and without identified risk factors.
   Conclusions. In these national samples of black, Hispanic, and white youth, unique and cross-cutting factors derived from a resiliency framework predicted or protected against attempting suicide. In addition to risk reduction, promotion of protective factors may offer an effective approach to primary as well as secondary prevention of adolescent suicidal behavior.

AB Reducing the availability of highly lethal and commonly used suicide methods has been associated with declines in suicide rates of as much as 30%-50% in other countries. The theory and evidence underlying means restriction is outlined. Most evidence of its efficacy comes from population-level interventions and natural experiments. In the U.S., where 51% of suicides are completed with firearms and household firearm ownership is common and likely to remain so, reducing a suicidal person's access to firearms will usually be accomplished not by fiat or other legislative initiative but rather by appealing to individual decision, for example, by counseling at-risk people and their families to temporarily store household firearms away from home or otherwise making household firearms inaccessible to the at-risk person until they have recovered. Providers, gatekeepers, and gun owner groups are important partners in this work. Research is needed in a number of areas: communications research to identify effective messages and messengers for "lethal means counseling," clinical trials to identify effective interventions, translational research to ensure broad uptake of these interventions across clinical and community settings, and foundational research to better understand method choice and substitution. Approaches to suicide methods other than firearms are discussed. Means restriction is one of the few empirically based strategies to substantially reduce the number of suicide deaths.

ID FALLS; INJURY; HEIGHTS
AB In the discovery of human remains from water environments, manner of death may not be immediately obvious to medicolegal investigators due to several factors, including lack of associated material evidence, nondescript contextual environment, or possible poor preservation of remains due to delayed recovery. The determination of patterns of skeletal trauma in suicidal bridge jumpers assists investigators in determining whether the manner of death was suicide versus non-suicide. This study reports on the patterns of skeletal trauma sustained in individuals who jumped from one of four large bridges in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, and explores victim demographics, bridge height, position of the body upon impact, and velocity at impact on skeletal trauma for this suicide population. Data for all bridge jumpers were collected from coroner files spanning the years 1990-2011. Skeletal trauma is more heavily focused in the thorax/ribs (63%) and craniofacial (30%) regions. Fifty-six percent of jumpers sustained polytrauma. Comparative data on drowning victims, bodies recovered from boating/airplane accidents, and individuals who died by other suicidal means all show patterns of injury different than bridge jumpers.

AB We analyzed international patterns and socioeconomic and rural-urban disparities in all-cause mortality and mortality from homicide, suicide, unintentional injuries, and HIV/AIDS among US youth aged 15-24 years. A county-level socioeconomic deprivation index and rural-urban continuum measure were linked to the 1999-2007 US mortality data. Mortality rates were calculated for each socioeconomic and rural-urban group. Poisson regression was used to derive adjusted relative risks of youth mortality by deprivation level and rural-urban residence. The USA has the highest youth homicide rate and 6th highest overall youth mortality rate in the industrialized world. Substantial socioeconomic and rural-urban gradients in youth mortality were observed within the USA. Compared to their most affluent counterparts, youth in the most deprived group had 1.9 times higher all-cause mortality, 8.0 times higher homicide mortality, 1.5 times higher unintentional-injury mortality, and 8.8 times higher HIV/AIDS mortality. Youth in rural areas had significantly higher mortality rates than their urban counterparts regardless of deprivation levels, with suicide and unintentional-injury mortality risks being 1.8 and 2.3 times larger in rural than in urban areas. However, youth in the most urbanized areas had at least 5.6 times higher risks of homicide and HIV/AIDS mortality than their rural counterparts. Disparities in mortality differed by race and sex. Socioeconomic deprivation and rural-urban continuum were independently related to disparities in youth mortality among all sex and racial/ethnic groups, although the impact of deprivation was considerably greater. The USA ranks poorly in all-cause mortality, youth homicide, and unintentional-injury mortality rates when compared with other industrialized countries.

AB Substance use carries a higher risk of unnatural death. A retrospective analysis of 42 treatment seekers between 2011-2015 was conducted through medical record review to understand the profile and circumstances leading to premature deaths. Ninety percent of the subjects were males. The mean age at death was 44.9 (SD +/- 13.1). Opioids (52.4%), benzodiazepines (45.2%) and alcohol (35.7%) were the main substances used by the group. Suicide was the most common cause of death (n = 27, 64.3%) followed by accidents (n = 15; 35.7%). Among the suicide cases, alcohol was the main substance used (33.3%) followed by opioids (25.9%). A total of 58.5% (n = 24) deaths occurred within a year of their last visit while 41.5% (n = 17) were dead more than a year after their last visit. Of the total cases (n = 41), 63% had a history of mental illness with depressive disorder (53.8%) being the most common. History of suicide attempts were reported in 34.1% (n = 14) of cases and 50% of the subjects (n = 21) had a history of suicidal ideation. Drug related offences were reported in 57.1% of the subjects, of which 60% (n = 18) committed suicide. The findings support the need for appropriate treatment resources to reduce the untimely deaths among substance users.

AB Researchers have recently emphasized the need to develop a greater understanding of factors and contexts that facilitate the progression from suicidal thoughts to suicidal behavior. Hopelessness has been implicated in numerous studies as one of the primary cognitive vulnerabilities associated with heightened suicide risk. This study aimed to address the extent to which grit moderates the association between hopelessness and both suicidal ideation and resolved plans and preparations for suicide within an understudied and high-risk population of United States military personnel. Results were consistent with the authors' hypotheses. Specifically, the relationship between hopelessness and current suicidal ideation decreased in magnitude at higher levels of grit. Similarly, whereas the relationship between hopelessness and resolved plans and preparations for suicide was significant and positive at low levels of grit, it was nonsignificant at mean levels of grit and significant and negative at high levels of grit. Overall, these results highlight grit as a potential protective factor against suicidal ideation and resolved plans and preparations, even in individuals experiencing elevated levels of hopelessness. The conditional nature of the relationship between hopelessness and both outcomes further highlights the need to consider contextual factors that extend beyond main effects models. These findings may contribute to the advancement of suicide research, prevention, and intervention methods by providing more clarity on trait and contextual risk factors that differentiate individuals who do and do not develop proximal risk factors for suicide.

AB The absence of validated U.S. rates of nonfatal suicidal behavior places risk management and injury prevention programs at danger of being poorly informed and inadequately conceptualized. In this study we compare estimated rates of intentional self-harm from two ongoing surveys (National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-All Injury Program-NEISS-ATP-, National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey-NHAMCS) to data from the Toxic Exposure Surveillance System. Results suggest that, for every 2002-2003 suicide, there were 12 (NEISS-AIP) or 15 (NHAMCS) self-harm-related emergency department visits, and for every intentional self-poisoning death there were 33 intentional overdoses reported to poison control centers, of which two ultimately went untreated.

That same year, Sulayman Al-Bassam premiered The Al-Hamlet Summit, his political appropriation of Hamlet, Mahmoud Darwish's Palestinian poetry, and Heiner Muller's Hamletmachine, at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Mapping the politics of anger and despair onto Shakespeare's play, he suggests that terrorism from Palestine to the United States is rooted in colonialism and Western military interventions in the Middle East. Hamlet is a jihadist, Horatio becomes a British Arms Dealer and Ophelia, a suicide bomber. This article explores the politics of representation in the body of Ophelia, who is anatomised as she detonates herself under the palace orange trees.

AB Suicide among United States active-duty Army soldiers rapidly increased over the past two decades. Using a sample of 322 soldiers from the Army STARRS study, the researchers examined if romantic relationship factors (i.e., hostile disagreements and relationship distress) were linked with suicidal thoughts in Army soldiers, and if these associations were moderated by a recent separation or divorce. Hostile disagreements and relational distress were both significantly associated with higher rates of suicidal ideation. These associations were significantly amplified in magnitude when in the context of a recent separation or divorce. Implications include novel assessment, prevention, and treatment efforts focused on romantic relationships that may reduce the likelihood of soldiers experiencing thoughts of suicide.

AB We exploit plausibly exogenous variation in overseas deployment assignment to estimate the effect of combat exposure on psychological well-being. Controlling for pre-deployment mental health, we find that active-duty soldiers deployed to combat zones are more likely to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than their counterparts deployed outside the United States in non-combat zones. Among those deployed to combat zones, those deployed to locales where they engage in enemy firefight or witness allied or civilian deaths are at an increased risk for suicidal ideation and PTSD relative to their active-duty counterparts deployed to combat zones without enemy firefight.

DT Review
ID INDIAN ADOLESCENTS; MENTAL-HEALTH; YOUTH; IDEATION; PREVENTION;
   BEHAVIORS
AB The alarming prevalence of suicidal behaviors in Native American communities remains a major concern in the 21st-century United States. Recent reviews have demonstrated that prevention programs and intervention efforts using transactional-ecological models have effectively reduced suicidal behaviors in the American Indian and Alaska Native populations sampled. As a result, this article adopts a transactional-ecological framework for conceptualizing suicidality and identifying points of intervention. Drawing on the most current empirical reports, the epidemiology of Native American suicidal behaviors is reviewed, while situating risk and protective factors within a biopsychosocial framework. Opportunities for intervention are discussed with a focus on the interactions between individuals and their environments, and the antecedent conditions leading to zones of heightened suicide risk.

ID SUICIDE; FIREARM; LAW; HOMICIDE; RATES
AB After a recent increase in violence, policy makers and advocates in Mexico have proposed new firearm legislation that would shift Mexican gun policies towards a more permissive approach. Following the argument of 'self-defense', these initiatives would facilitate citizens' access to guns by allowing them to carry firearms in automobiles and businesses. These initiatives have been developed without a deep analysis of the effects of permissive gun laws. In this article, the authors present an assessment of what Mexican policymakers and advocates should be aware of regarding permissive gun laws using the example of the United States, the nation with the highest rate of gun ownership in the world and where these policies are already in effect.

AB In the United States, benzodiazepine medication use is the secondary epidemic to opioid drug use and carries serious consequences as well, even though its use is enabled by well-intended clinicians. Benzodiazepine drugs are intended for short-term use, not to exceed 2 to 4 weeks; yet, it is common for clients to be taking benzodiazepine medications for up to 10 years. In addition to dependence or addiction, adverse effects include depression, emotional blunting, ataxia, aggression, irritability, nervousness, and cognitive impairment.These medications also contribute to increased risk for falls, suicide, overdose fatality, and vehicle crashes. The current article describes the epidemiology of benzodiazepine medication use, patient and prescriber factors that contribute to overuse and misuse, and recommendations for prescribing and deprescribing.

AB Because suicide attempts are multi-determined events, multiple pathways to suicidal behaviors exist. However, as a low-frequency behavior, within group differences in trajectories to attempts may not emerge when examined in samples including non-attempters. We used longitudinal latent profile analysis to identify subtypes specific for suicide attempters based on longitudinal trajectories of childhood clinical symptoms (i.e., depression, anxiety, and aggression measured in 2nd, 4th-7th grades) for 161 young adults (35.6% male; 58.6% African American) who attempted suicide between ages 13-30 from a large, urban community-based, longitudinal prevention trial (n = 2311). Differences in psychiatric diagnoses, suicide attempt characteristics, criminal history and traumatic stress history were studied. Three subtypes emerged: those with all low (n = 32%), all high (n = 16%), and high depressive/anxious, but low aggressive (n = 52%) symptoms. Those with the highest levels of all symptoms were significantly more likely to report a younger age of suicide attempt, and demonstrate more substance abuse disorders and violent criminal histories. Prior studies have found that childhood symptoms of depression, anxiety and aggression are malleable targets; interventions directed at each reduce future risk for suicidal behaviors. Our findings highlight the link of childhood aggression with future suicidal behaviors extending this research by examining childhood symptoms of aggression in the context of depression and anxiety.

AB A total of 2,611 calls to 14 helplines were monitored to observe helper behaviors and caller characteristics and changes during the calls. The relationship between intervention characteristics and call outcomes are reported for 1,431 crisis calls. Empathy and respect, as well as factor-analytically derived scales of supportive approach and good contact and collaborative problem solving were significantly related to positive outcomes, but not active listening. We recommend recruitment of helpers with these characteristics, development of standardized training in those methods that are empirically shown to be effective, and the need for research relating short-term outcomes to long-term effects.

AB A number of concerns have recently been raised about whether or not antidepressant medications are associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviour in children and adolescents. These concerns are based largely on results of meta-analyses of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs). Controversy exists about generalizing evidence from short-term RCTs, designed primarily to test efficacy outcomes, to routine practice settings. Pharmacoepidemiological studies complement RCTs by using observational methods to examine safety and effectiveness of medications in the general population. This article reviews the contribution of pharmaco epidemiology to the controversy surrounding suicide risk in children and adolescents taking antidepressants, noting how variations in study design and adjustment for potential confounding factors influence outcome.

ID SEASONAL-VARIATION; VIOLENT SUICIDE; TRENDS; AGE
AB The objective of this analysis is to explore the possibility that Brearley's failure to detect a coherent pattern of seasonal variation in his well-known study of homicide in the United States was due to a lack of statistical refinement. The original data on homicides in the United States between 1923 and 1928 (N = 51,798) were reanalyzed using spectral analysis. The results show a significant seasonal dependency with a peak in the homicide rate in August. The seasonal dependency explains between 23% and 30% of the total homicide variance. The importance of this finding is the degree of explained variance and the location of the peak, which is remarkably consistent with more contemporary studies using similar methods despite substantial sociodemographic changes, suggesting an endogenous etiology.

AB Psychiatric nurses should be uniquely positioned for helping to prevent firearm suicides and homicides among the mentally ill. This study assessed the prevalence of firearm injury prevention training in graduate psychiatric nursing training programs through a three-wave mail survey of program directors. Most (87%) of the directors reported that they had not seriously thought about providing firearm injury prevention training. Almost half (48%) reported they did not routinely screen patients for firearm ownership. In addition, most (66%) thought that the American Psychiatric Nurses Association (APNA) should provide curriculum guidelines regarding firearm injury prevention training. Leadership is needed by the APNA to help reduce firearm violence in the mentally ill. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Research has shown a relationship between income inequality and poor health. This column reports findings from a state-level study of the relationship between income inequality and the prevalence of depression. Estimates of depression prevalence by state, obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, were linked with Gini coefficients for U. S. household income, obtained from the Census Bureau. The current prevalence of depression was significantly associated with income inequality-the more unequal, the higher the depression prevalence. The association persisted after adjustment for income per capita, percentage of the population with a college degree, and percentage over age 65 years. (Psychiatric Services 62: 710-712, 2011)

AB As suicide rates continue to rise in the United States, efforts to study the factors that might create vulnerability to suicidal thoughts and behaviors have similarly increased. Challenges associated with arriving at an empirical understanding of the role that environmental, relational, intrapsychic, and other sources of risk play in determining an individual's vulnerability to acting on suicidal impulses has led to limited efforts to articulate a comprehensive model of suicide that takes psychoanalytically informed developmental principles into account. Whereas the few longitudinal studies of suicidal individuals that do exist have primarily focused on history of psychiatric symptoms, the timing of traumatic events, and the stability of other specific risk factors known to relate to suicide, research is lacking that addresses the relative influence of relational disturbances and subjective experiences of pain and alienation in suicidal individuals, which often begin in childhood and adolescence and are known to play a role in determining how an individual contends with experiences of adversity over the course of a lifetime. This paper provides an overview of literature relevant to the understanding of how psychoanalytic constructs such as attachment style, object relations, and defenses are related to suicidal behavior, and illustrates the need for ongoing research on suicidal behaviors approached from within a psychoanalytic perspective.

AB Objective: To examine violence exposure, violent behaviors, psychological trauma, and suicide risk in a community sample of dangerously violent adolescents by comparison with a matched community sample of nonviolent adolescents. Method: Anonymous self-report questionnaires were administered in the 1992-1993 school year to students in grades 9 through 12, in six public high schools located in Ohio and Colorado (N = 3,735). From this sample, 484 adolescents (349 males, 135 females) who reported attacking someone with a knife or shooting at someone within the past year (i.e., dangerously Violent adolescents) were drawn. Four hundred eighty-four controls were also selected and matched on gender, age in years, ethnicity, area of residence, and family structure. Results: Dangerously violent adolescents reported higher levels of exposure to violence and victimization than did matched controls. Dangerously violent females were more likely to score in the clinical range of depression. anxiety, posttraumatic stress, anger, and dissociation than were control females and violent males; they also had significantly higher levels of suicide potential. Conclusions: Students who have been known to commit Violent acts should be adequately assessed for Violence exposure and symptoms of psychological trauma, with special attention given to the suicide potential of Violent females.

AB Background: In 2016, nearly 45,000 deaths in the United States were attributed to suicide making this the 10th leading cause of death for all ages. National survey data suggest that among Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs), including firefighters and Paramedics, rates of suicide are significantly higher than among the general public. EMTs face high levels of acute and chronic stress as well as high rates of depression and substance abuse, which increase their risk of suicide. Objective/Aim: To determine the statewide Mortality Odds Ratio (MOR) of suicide completion among EMTs as compared to non-EMTs in Arizona. Methods: We analyzed the Arizona Vital Statistics Information Management System Electronic Death Registry of all adult (>= 18) deaths between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2015. Manual review of decedent occupation was performed to identify the EMT cohort; all other deaths were included in the non-EMT cohort. Using the underlying cause of death as the outcome, we calculated the MOR of both the EMT and non-EMT cohorts. Results: There were a total of 350,998 deaths during the study period with 7,838 categorized as suicide. The proportion of deaths attributed to suicide among EMTs was 5.2% (63 of 1,205 total deaths) while the percentage among non-EMTs was 2.2% (7,775/349,793) (p < 0.0001). The crude Mortality Odds Ratio for EMTs compared with non-EMTs was [cMOR 2.43; 95% CI (1.88-3.13)]. After adjusting for gender, age, race, and ethnicity, EMTs had higher odds that their death was by suicide than non-EMTs [aMOR: 1.39; 95% CI (1.06-1.82)]. Conclusion: In this statewide analysis, we found that EMTs had a significantly higher Mortality Odds Ratio due to suicide compared to non-EMTs. Further research is necessary to identify the underlying causes of suicide among EMTs and to develop effective prevention strategies.

TI Association of Increased Youth Suicides in the United States With the
   Release of <i>13 Reasons Why</i>
SO JAMA PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
AB IMPORTANCE On March 31, 2017, Netflix released the show 13 Reasons Why, sparking immediate criticism from suicide prevention organizations for not following media recommendations for responsible suicide portrayal and for possible suicide contagion by media. To date, little research has been conducted into the associations between the show and suicide counts among its young target audience.
   OBJECTIVE To analyze the changes in suicide counts after the release of 13 Reasons Why.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS For this time series analysis, monthly suicide data for the age groups 10 to 19 years, 20 to 29 years, and 30 years or older for both US males and females from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2017, were extracted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's WONDER (Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research) database. Twitter and Instagram posts were used as a proxy to estimate the amount of attention the show received through social media from April 1, 2017, to June 30, 2017. Autoregressive integrated moving average time series models were fitted to the pre-April 2017 period to estimate suicides among the age groups and to identify changes in specific suicide methods used. The models were fitted to the full time series with dummy variables for (1) April 2017 and (2) April 1, 2017, to June 30, 2017. Data were analyzed in December 2018 and January 2019.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Suicide data before and after the release of the show in 2017.
   RESULTS Based on social media data, public interest in the show was highest in April 2017 and was negligible after June 2017. For 10- to 19-year-old males and females, increases in the observed values from April to June 2017 were outside the 95% confidence bands of forecasts. Models testing 3-month associated suicide mortality indicated 66 (95% CI, 16.3-115.7) excess suicides among males (12.4% increase; 95% CI, 3.1%-21.8%) and 37 (95% CI, 12.4-61.5) among females (21.7% increase; 95% CI, 7.3%-36.2%). No excess suicide mortality was seen in other age groups. The increase in the hanging suicide method was particularly high (26.9% increase; 95% CI, 15.3%-38.4%).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Caution must be taken in interpreting these findings; however, the suicide increase in youth only and the signal of a potentially larger increase in young females all appear to be consistent with a contagion by media and seem to reinforce the need for collaboration toward improving fictional portrayals of suicide.

AB BACKGROUND: Although suicide is a known leading cause of death among street youth, few prospective studies have explored childhood experiences as risk factors for future suicide attempt in this population. We examined the risk of attempted suicide in relation to childhood maltreatment among street youth.
   METHODS: From September 2005 to November 2013, data were collected from the At Risk Youth Study (ARYS), a prospective cohort of street youth in Vancouver, Canada. Inclusion criteria were age 14 to 26 years, past-month illicit drug use, and street involvement. Participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, an instrument measuring self-reported sexual, physical, and emotional abuse and physical and emotional neglect. Suicide attempts were assessed semiannually. Using Cox regression, we examined the association between the 5 types of maltreatment and suicide attempts.
   RESULTS: Of 660 participants, 68.2% were male and 24.6% were Aboriginal. Median age was 21.5 years. The prevalence of moderate to extreme childhood maltreatment ranged from 16.8% (sexual abuse) to 45.2% (emotional abuse). Participants contributed 1841 person-years, with suicide attempts reported by 35 (5.3%) individuals (crude incidence density: 1.9 per 100 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4-2.6 per 100 person-years). In adjusted analyses, types of maltreatment associated with suicide attempts included physical abuse (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 4.47; 95% CI: 2.12-9.42), emotional abuse (adjusted HR: 4.92; 95% CI: 2.11-11.5), and emotional neglect (adjusted HR: 3.08; 95% CI: 1.05-9.03).
   CONCLUSIONS: Childhood maltreatment is associated with subsequent risk of suicidal behavior among street youth. Suicide prevention efforts should be targeted toward this marginalized population and delivered from a trauma-informed perspective.

AB QUESTIONS UNDER STUDY: Suicidal behaviour is a major source of burden of disease. While most studies focus on cost associated with completed suicides, data on costs of, non-lethal, suicide attempts are lacking. The aim of this study was to assess direct annual cost of suicide attempts in Basel in 2003 from a health services perspective.
   METHODS: Retrospective cost-of-illness-study of the Basel cohort of the 2003 WHO/EURO-Multicentre Study on Parasuicide. We extracted cost information from the two major hospitals involved in treatment of these patients. We determined overall cost, compared cost medians and identified variables associated with higher cost by means of logistic regression.
   RESULTS: For 2003, treatment of suicide attempters in Basel's main hospitals amounted to 3,373,025 Swiss Francs (CHF), mainly attributable to psychiatric care. Mean and median cost per case were 19,165 CHF and 6,108 CHF, respectively. Based on these findings, the extrapolated direct medical costs for medical treatment of suicide attempts in Switzerland per year amount to 191 million CHF. Parameters associated with high costs were age above 65 (p < 0.01), using a hard method (p < 0.05), receiving intensive care (p <.05), and lethal intention (p < 0.05). The ICD-10 diagnostic category F3 was associated with significantly higher costs than F1 (p < 0.05) and F4 (p < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Attempted suicide produces substantial direct medical costs, which are only a part of the financial burden. Prevention targeting mood disorders, the elderly and the use of hard methods may be most cost-effective. Further research should aim at identifying additional indirect costs and the cost-effectiveness of prevention measures.

Legal interventions to prevent gun violence include legislation targeted at gun manufacturers, dealers, and buyers or litigation. The primary perceived legal obstacle is the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; other constitutional provisions (real obstacles) may have greater impact in the courtroom.

AB OBJECTIVES: To compare the effect of hospitalization with medical illnesses on the suicide risk in the oldest old (>= 80) with that in the old (65-79) and middle-aged (52-64) using nationwide data.
   DESIGN: Event-history analysis using time-varying covariates based on prospective individual-level register data.
   SETTING: Population-based record linkage.
   PARTICIPANTS: All persons aged 52 and older living in Denmark during 1996 to 1998 (N=1,684,205).
   MEASUREMENTS: The studied event is completed suicide. The following time-varying variables are included in the analysis: current age, hospitalization with medical illnesses within previous 2 years, and number of different medical diagnoses given at hospitalizations within previous 2 years. Relative suicide risks were calculated using event-history analysis. The proportional attributable risk was calculated to assess to which extent hospitalization can explain the increased suicide risk in the oldest old.
   RESULTS: During the 3-year study period, 1,184 persons committed suicide. Hospitalization with medical illnesses was associated with an increased suicide risk in the study population. The highest suicide rates were found in the oldest-old men who had been hospitalized during the previous 2 years: 113 per 100,000 versus 80 per 100,000 in the general population of men aged 80 and older. Also, the oldest-old women with a history of hospitalization had a higher suicide rate than their peer group. Nevertheless, the oldest old experienced a lower increase in risk after hospitalization than the middle-aged. Experiencing three or more different diagnoses increased the risk further. Almost two-thirds of the oldest old who committed suicide had experienced a medical hospitalization during a 2-year period preceding the suicide. A substantial part of the greater suicide rate in the oldest old than in the middle-aged can be attributed to the increased prevalence of medical hospitalization.
   CONCLUSION: The oldest old who have been hospitalized with medical illnesses have a significantly higher suicide risk than people in the same age range with no hospitalization, although they experience a lower increase in risk after hospitalization than the middle-aged. The increased prevalence of medical illnesses explains a part of the greater suicide risk with age, especially for the oldest old women. Considering that hospitalization with medical illness often precedes suicide in the oldest old, hospitalization may play an important role in identification of suicidal ideation in older people.

AB AIMS: In comparison with other central European countries, Switzerland has a high prevalence of gun ownership and a high rate of suicide by shooting. After the Army XXI reform in 2003, which reduced personnel from about 400,000 to approximately 200,000, a decline in suicides by firearms and a decline in the total number of suicides was observed in national data spanning the period from 2000 to 2010. It is, however, unclear whether this decline can be linked to the reduced availability of military guns. This study explored whether the decline in suicide by firearms is related to the decline of suicides by army weapons. METHODS: In 83.1% ( n = 1112) of the 1338 suicides by firearm between 2000 and 2010 in Switzerland, the firearm could be categorised as an army weapon or a non- army weapon. The army weapon was used in 39.1% of these suicides. In comparison with other firearms, those who used army weapons tended to be younger and more likely to have a university degree. A prior suicide attempt was found less often in cases using a military weapon than other firearms. After the Army XXI reform, there was a significant drop in suicides by males aged 18 to 43 years using an army weapon, but no change in male suicide rates in the same age group who used a non- army weapon. The drop was statistically linked to a reduction of suicide by the army gun. RESULTS: The army weapon was used in 39.1% of suicides by firearm between 2000 and 2010 in Switzerland. In comparison with other methods, those who used army weapons tended to be younger and more likely to have a university degree. A prior suicide attempt was found less often in cases using a military weapon than other methods. After the Army XXI reform, there was a significant drop in suicides by males aged 18 to 43 years using an army weapon, but no change in males' suicide rates in the same age group who used a non- army weapon. The drop was statistically linked to a reduction of suicide by the army gun. CONCLUSIONS: Males who use army weapons differ from those who use other types of weapons. The significant drop in suicides was found in males aged 18 to 43 but there was no change in males of the same age group who used a non- army weapon. These results support the hypotheses that the observed drop in suicides is linked to the Army XXI reform and that restriction of access to guns is essential for reducing suicides by firearm.

AB Objectives. We examined the longitudinal associations between different types and severities of childhood trauma and suicide attempts among illicit drug users.
   Methods. Data came from 2 prospective cohort studies of illicit drug users in Vancouver, Canada, in 2005 to 2010. We used recurrent event proportional means models to estimate adjusted and weighted associations between types and severities of childhood maltreatment and suicide attempts.
   Results. Of 1634 participants, 411 (25.2%) reported a history of suicidal behavior at baseline. Over 5 years, 80 (4.9%) participants reported 97 suicide attempts, a rate of 2.6 per 100 person-years. Severe to extreme levels of sexual abuse (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4, 4.4), physical abuse (AHR = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.1, 3.8), and emotional abuse (AHR = 3.5; 95% CI = 1.4, 8.7) predicted suicide attempts. Severe forms of physical and emotional neglect were not significantly associated with an increased risk of suicidal behavior.
   Conclusions. Severe sexual, physical, and emotional childhood abuse confer substantial risk of repeated suicidal behavior in adulthood. Illicit drug users require intensive secondary suicide prevention efforts, particularly among those with a history of childhood trauma.

TI Suicide behavior among Latino and Latina adolescents:: Conceptual and

AB Suicide is the cause of 11.7% of all deaths among youth and young adults aged 10 to 24 years in the United States ( J. A. Grunbaum et al., 2004). Suicide is third leading cause of death for young Latinos/as aged 10 to 24 years ( National Institute of Mental Health, 2001). Latino/a youth are at a greater risk of suicide behavior than other ethnic groups ( G. Canino& R. E. Roberts, 2001). Latinos/as have less access to mental health services than do Whites and are less likely to receive needed care ( U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2001). This article reviews the scientific literature related to suicide behavior among Latino/a adolescent since 1990. Conceptual and methodological issues in research are examined and the role of contextual and developmental factors on suicide behavior is discussed. The empirical findings of comparative ethnic minority studies, studies focused on Latino/a youth, and within-group studies are reviewed. Research on Latino/a adolescent suicide behavior is limited, few studies focus on any Latino subgroup and it is rare to find comparative studies focus on within-group diversity among Latinos. For the most part, no explanatory variables that may account for the differences among groups or that help explain the meaning of the suicide behavior were found. Research efforts should move away from using generic labels ( e. g., Hispanics, Latinos, etc.) and shift toward addressing group-specific ( e. g., Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, etc.) findings that have implications for prevention and treatment of target populations ( G. Canino & R. E. Roberts, 2001; J. D. Hovey & C. A. King, 1997). Suicide behavior studies among specific Latino/a adolescents that are based on theory and informed by ecodevelopmental, gender-specific perspectives should advance the field.

   MANAGEMENT; METABOLISM; DIAGNOSIS; MORBIDITY; EFFICACY
AB Regulatory agencies in the United Kingdom and United States have been critically examining the possible link between suicidality and antidepressant use in children and adults, which has resulted in an FDA directive to the manufacturers of all antidepressant medications to add a 'black box' warning that describes the increased risk of suicidal behaviour in children and adolescents who take antidepressants. A crucial issue in this debate, as we discuss here, is the assessment of the capacity of antidepressants to increase suicidality over and above what is caused by the underlying disorder, major depression, which is itself the principal cause of suicide.

TI Influence of social and material individual and area deprivation on

AB Background: Few studies have investigated how area-level deprivation influences the relationship between individual disadvantage and suicide mortality. The aim of this study was to examine individual measures of material and social disadvantage in relation to suicide mortality in Canada and to determine whether these relationships were modified by area deprivation.
   Methods: Using the 1991-2001 Canadian Census Mortality Follow-up Study cohort (N = 2,685,400), measures of individual social (civil status, family structure, living alone) and material (education, income, employment) disadvantage were entered into Cox proportional hazard models to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for male and female suicide mortality. Two indices of area deprivation were computed one capturing social, and the other material, dimensions - and models were run separately for high versus low deprivation.
   Results: After accounting for individual and area characteristics, individual social and material disadvantage were associated with higher suicide mortality, especially for individuals not employed, not married, with low education and low income. Associations between social and material area deprivation and suicide mortality largely disappeared upon adjustment for individual-level disadvantage. In stratified analyses, suicide risk was greater for low income females in socially deprived areas and males living alone in materially deprived areas, and there was no evidence of other modifying effects of area deprivation.
   Conclusions: Individual disadvantage was associated with suicide mortality, particularly for males. With some exceptions, there was little evidence that area deprivation modified the influence of individual disadvantage on suicide risk. Prevention strategies should primarily focus on individuals who are unemployed or out of the labour force, and have low education or income. Individuals with low income or who are living alone in deprived areas should also be targeted.

ID GAY MEN; UNITED-STATES; HIV/AIDS; AIDS; DEATH; AREAS; RISK; CARE;

AB This study characterized rates and predictors of suicidal thoughts among HIV-infected persons living in rural communities of eight U.S. states. Self-administered surveys were completed by 201 HIV-infected persons living in communities of 50,000 or fewer that were located at least 20 miles from a city of 100,000 or more. All participants were clients of rural AIDS service organizations and had recently enrolled into a randomized clinical trial of a telephone-delivered, coping improvement-group intervention designed specifically for HIV-infected rural persons. At baseline, participants reported on thoughts of suicide, psychological symptomatology, life-stressor burden, ways of coping, coping self-efficacy, social support, and barriers to health care and social services. Thirty-eight percent of HIV-infected rural persons had engaged in thoughts of suicide during the past week. A logistic regression analysis revealed that participants who endorsed thoughts of suicide also reported more depressive symptoms (odds ratio [OR] = 2.19; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.32-3.63, p < .002), less coping self-efficacy (OR = 0.70; 95% CI = 0.56-0.88, p < .002), more frequently worried about transmitting their HIV infection to others (OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.14-2.40, p < .008), and experienced more stress associated with AIDS-related stigma (OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.07-2.35, p < .03). As AIDS prevalence rates increase in rural areas, interventions that successfully identify and treat geographically isolated HIV-infected persons who experience more frequent or serious thoughts of suicide are urgently needed.

AB Objective: To determine the lifetime history of suicide attempts in incarcerated youths and psychological factors related to suicidal and self-mutilative behaviors during incarceration. Method: A 25% systematic random sample chart review of adolescents admitted to a juvenile correctional facility yielded a sample of 289 adolescents. Seventy-eight of these adolescents were clinically referred for psychiatric assessment. Suicidal behavior was assessed with the Spectrum of Suicidal Behavior Scale and self-mutilation with the Functional Assessment of Self-Mutilation. Results: Of the 289 adolescents, 12.4% reported a prior suicide attempt. Almost 60% of these attempts were made using violent methods (e.g., cutting). Of the 78 clinically referred subjects, 30% reported suicidal ideation/behavior and 30% reported self-mutilative behavior while incarcerated. Suicidal clinically referred adolescents reported more depression, anxiety, and anger than nonsuicidal youths. Adolescents who reported self-mutilative behavior had higher anxiety, anger, and substance use than non-self-mutilative adolescents. Conclusions: Results suggest that incarcerated adolescents have higher rates of suicide attempts and use more violent methods of attempt than adolescents in the general population. Furthermore, incarcerated clinically referred suicidal and self-mutilative youths report more severe affective symptoms than their nonsuicidal and non-self-mutilative counterparts, suggesting a need for mental health treatment.

AB Most empirical research examining physician views on physician-assisted suicide (PAS) has used quantitative methods to characterize positions and identify predictors of individual attitudes. This approach has generated limited information about the nature and depth of sentiments among physicians most impassioned about PAS. This study reports qualitative data provided by 909 physicians as part of a larger survey (N = 2,805) regarding attitudes toward and experiences with PAS and palliative care. Emergent themes illustrate important clinical, social, and ethical considerations in this area. The data illustrate the diverse and ardent responses that PAS evokes among certain physicians. The role of physicians' personal values is central to discussions about legalization of PAS. Polarized views such as those expressed by physicians in this study are not likely to be reconciled, thereby constraining the development of public policy regarding PAS.

AB On July 19th, 2005, American Army Private First Class LaVena Johnson died in Balad, Iraq, just 8 days shy of her 20th birthday. On July 13th, 2015, almost 10 years later, 28-year-old Sandra Bland's life came to an abrupt end in a jail cell in Waller County, Texas. Both women's deaths were ruled suicides, and both women's families and friends reject these judgments. Instead, they insinuate foul play by the state, which directly governed the militarized spaces within which the women both died. At first glance, these women appear to have had very different life trajectories, one a United States soldier and the other a Black Lives Matter activist. However, in both of their cases, the ruling of the suspicious deaths as suicides illustrates the state's attempt to render their deaths banal, and thereby diminish the state's own culpability. In understanding the unremitting acts of violence, on women's bodies, especially women of color, this paper focuses on how a Black feminist praxis extends feminist notions of an ethics of care.

   MANAGEMENT; ATTITUDES; EDUCATION; STUDENTS; STRESS
AB ObjectiveThis study examined psychologists' willingness to accept a new client into their private practice as a function of the client's clinical presentation (with or without overt suicidality). Psychologists' openness to working with a client at risk of suicide was evaluated in the context of potential barriers to treatment provision, such as practitioners' endorsement of stigmatizing attitudes, concerns over liability and inadequate training, and limited access to community resources.
   MethodEighty-six licensed psychologists practicing within the United States were surveyed via e-mail and randomly assigned to one of two conditions, consisting of exposure to a vignette describing either a client reporting current suicidal ideation and a history of attempts or a client without explicitly elevated suicide risk. All participants were asked to complete a questionnaire assessing their likelihood of accepting the hypothetical client into their practice and examining possible explanations for disinclination to provide treatment.
   ResultsPsychologists were less willing to work with a client experiencing suicidality than an individual without elevated suicide risk. Those indicating a reluctance to provide services reported greater concerns over the adequacy of their suicide-related skills and training and fewer resources in the community.
   ConclusionsRecommendations for improving the responsiveness of private practitioners are provided, with an emphasis on enhancing clinical training and increasing the availability and accessibility of mental health resources.

AB We examined an association between a history of hospital-treated depression and physical diseases in 1877 suicide victims from Northern Finland. Information on physical diseases and depression of victims was extracted from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Registers. Of suicide victims, 31% of female and 16% of male victims had a lifetime history of depression. When compared with victims without any lifetime hospital-treated physical illnesses, a history of depression was shown to associate with the diseases of the nervous, circulatory, respiratory, and musculoskeletal systems in the group of symptoms and signs, injuries and poisonings, and infectious diseases among male victims. Respectively, in female victims, an increased prevalence of depression was seen in endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases, diseases of the nervous, circulatory, genitourinary, skin and subcutaneous tissue, and musculoskeletal systems, and with injuries and poisonings, pregnancy-related problems and infectious diseases. This study is the first to evaluate comorbidity between physical illnesses and depression over the lifetime in Suicide victims; earlier studies reported Findings in living patients from epidemiological or clinical populations. Since depression can affect quality of life in severely ill patients, targeting depression in patients with chronic illness may assist in decreasing suicide rates. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB ObjectiveBreast cancer patients are associated with an increased risk for committing suicide. The purpose of this study was to study the trends in the incidence of suicide mortality and identify pertinent risk factors among patients with breast cancer.
   MethodsA retrospective examination of the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database between years 1973 and 2013 was performed.
   ResultsOverall, 474128 patients were identified of which 773 had committed suicide. There were no significant differences in the incidence of suicide mortality over the last 3 decades (1984-1993: 0.14%, 1994-2003: 0.16%, 2004-2013: 0.17%, P=0.173). On logistic regression, younger age (<30y: OR 6.34, 95% CI: 1.98-20.33, P=0.002; 30-49y: OR 10.64, 95% CI: 7.97-14.2, P<0.001; 50-69y: OR 4.7, 95% CI: 3.64-6.07, P<0.001), male sex (OR 4.34, 95% CI: 2.57-7.31, P<0.001), nonwhite-nonblack race (OR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.01-1.91, P=0.046), marital status (single: OR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.04-1.76, P=0.024; separated/divorced/widowed: OR 1.25, 95% CI: 1.01-1.55, P=0.043), undergoing surgery (OR 2.13, 95% CI: 1.23-3.67, P=0.007), and short-time elapsed from diagnosis (first year: OR 4.67, 95% CI: 3.39-6.42, P<0.001; second year: OR 2.35, 95% CI: 1.69-3.27, P<0.001) were independent risk factors of suicide mortality.
   ConclusionsThere have been no identifiable improvements in preventing suicide mortality in the United States. Younger age, male sex, race, marital status, and undergoing surgery are independent risk factors for committing suicide, especially in the first year after diagnosis.

AB Background: In 2009, suicide accounted for 36 897 deaths in the United States.
   Purpose: To review the accuracy of screening instruments and the efficacy and safety of screening for and treatment of suicide risk in populations and settings relevant to primary care.
   Data Sources: Citations from MEDLINE, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and CINAHL (2002 to 17 July 2012); gray literature; and a surveillance search of MEDLINE for additional screening trials (July to December 2012).
   Study Selection: Fair-or good-quality English-language studies that assessed the accuracy of screening instruments in primary care or similar populations and trials of suicide prevention interventions in primary or mental health care settings.
   Data Extraction: One investigator abstracted data; a second checked the abstraction. Two investigators rated study quality.
   Data Synthesis: Evidence was insufficient to determine the benefits of screening in primary care populations; very limited evidence identified no serious harms. Minimal evidence suggested that screening tools can identify some adults at increased risk for suicide in primary care, but accuracy was lower in studies of older adults. Minimal evidence limited to high-risk populations suggested poor performance of screening instruments in adolescents. Trial evidence showed that psychotherapy reduced suicide attempts in high-risk adults but not adolescents. Most trials were insufficiently powered to detect effects on deaths.
   Limitation: Treatment evidence was derived from high-risk rather than screening-detected populations. Evidence relevant to adolescents, older adults, and racial or ethnic minorities was limited.
   Conclusion: Primary care-feasible screening tools might help to identify some adults at increased risk for suicide but have limited ability to detect suicide risk in adolescents. Psychotherapy may reduce suicide attempts in some high-risk adults, but effective interventions for high-risk adolescents are not yet proven.

AB This study was intended to analyze the intersection of experience of sexual stigma low-socioeconomic status, and suicide attempt amongst young Brazilians (11-24 years old). In each of the data collection periods (2004-2006: n = 7185; 2010-2012: n = 2734), participants completed a questionnaire-based instrument. Network analysis provided support for a Minority Stress Model, oriented around whether participants had experienced sexual stigma. Although suicide attempts decreased by 20% for participants who had not experienced sexual stigma, there was a 60% increase for those who had experienced sexual stigma. Of particular note were the increases in rates of reported community and familial physical assault, molestation, and rape for those who had experienced sexual stigma. An analysis of centrality statistics demonstrated that both experiences of this Minority Stress Model were fundamentally different, and that those disparities increased over the time frame observed in this study. At the center of this model, shortest paths statistics exhibited a direct conditioned connection between experiencing sexual stigma and suicide attempts. We discuss the social and historical contexts that contributed to these dynamics, and emphasize the need for policy change.

AB Introduction: Injuries, including those resulting from violence, are a leading cause of death during pregnancy and the postpartum period. North Carolina, along with other states, has implemented surveillance systems to improve reporting of maternal deaths, but their ability to capture violent deaths is unknown. The purpose of this study was to quantify the improvement in ascertainment of pregnancy-associated suicides and homicides by linking data from the North Carolina Violent Death Reporting System (NC-VDRS) to traditional maternal mortality surveillance files.
   Methods: Enhanced case ascertainment was used to identify suicides and homicides that occurred during or up to 1 year after pregnancy from 2005 to 2011 in North Carolina. NC-VDRS data were linked to traditional maternal mortality surveillance files (i.e., death certificates with any mention of pregnancy or matched to a live birth or fetal death record and hospital discharge records for women who died in the hospital with a pregnancy-related diagnosis). Mortality ratios were calculated by case ascertainment method. Analyses were conducted in 2015.
   Results: A total of 29 suicides and 55 homicides were identified among pregnant and postpartum women through enhanced case ascertainment as compared with 20 and 34, respectively, from traditional case ascertainment. Linkage to NC-VDRS captured 55.6% more pregnancy-associated violent deaths than traditional surveillance alone, resulting in higher mortality ratios for suicide (2.3 vs 3.3 deaths per 100,000 live births) and homicide (3.9 vs 6.2 deaths per 100,000 live births).
   Conclusions: Linking traditional maternal mortality files to NC-VDRS provided a notable improvement in ascertainment of pregnancy-associated violent deaths. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

AB A robust literature on ingroup versus outgroup conflict suggests that perceived discrimination may be an important factor in intergroup aggression. Yet, to date, no studies have tested the hypothesis that the perception of being the victim of anti-Muslim discrimination might be associated with support for anti-Western political violence. We undertook an analysis of two Pew Global Attitudes Surveys: (1) a 2006 data set surveying 1,627 adult Muslim residents of Great Britain, France, Germany, and Spain and (2) a 2007 data surveying 1,050 adult Muslim residents of the United States. Our analyses support the conclusions that younger age and perceived discrimination are both associated with support of suicide bombing in these Muslim diaspora populations. Study 1 found that a bad experience of discrimination increased the odds of justifying suicide bombing among European Muslims by a factor of 3.4. Study 2 found that experienced discrimination was associated with justification of suicide bombing among American Muslims. If further investigations confirm that perceived discrimination is a risk factor for support for political violence, initiatives to reduce discrimination would theoretically reduce the risk of terrorism. We discuss the challenge of breaking the vicious cycle of intergroup prejudice and radicalization.

AB Background: There is a discrepancy in the frequency of non-lethal and lethal suicidal behavior. Given the extensive training in firearms within the military and prior research indicating that military personnel exhibit elevated mean levels of the acquired capability, we hypothesized that the ratio between non-lethal and lethal suicidal behavior would be lower in US military personnel than in the general population.
   Method: We examined publicly available data on non-lethal and lethal suicidal behavior within the US military and US general population.
   Results: The ratio of non-lethal to lethal suicidal behavior was lower in military across sex and age. Furthermore, results indicated that a greater proportion of both non-lethal and lethal suicide attempts in military personnel involved firearms. When considering only suicidal behavior unrelated to firearms, the ratio remained significantly lower in the military. The ratio of non-lethal to lethal suicidal behavior involving drugs and alcohol was not significantly lower in the military.
   Limitations: The use of public data precluded analyses directly testing competing theories. Also, level of intent involved in non-lethal self-injury in the general population was unclear. Finally, only active duty personnel were considered in analyses related to the military.
   Conclusions: Suicide attempts in the military are more likely to result in death than in the general population. This appears to be primarily due to the use more lethal means. Clinically, this speaks to the importance of recognizing suicidal desire in military personnel, as it is more likely to be paired with the capacity for suicide than in civilians.

AB Objective: To determine the association between mortality from violent or firearm related injury and previous handgun purchase.
   Methods: Case-control study of 213 466 Californians ages 21 and older who died in 1998; cases were the 4728 violent or firearm related injury deaths, with subsets by specific cause and means of death, and controls were the 208 738 non-injury deaths. The exposure of interest was the purchase of a handgun during 1996-98. The main outcome measure was the odds ratio for handgun purchase, adjusted for age, sex, race, education, and marital status.
   Results: Handgun purchase was more common among persons dying from suicide (odds ratio (OR) 6.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.7 to 8.1) or homicide (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.6 to 3.7), and particularly among those dying from gun suicide (OR 12.5; 95% CI 10.4 to 15.0) or gun homicide (OR 3.3; 95% CI 2.1 to 5.3), than among controls. No such differences were seen for non-gun suicide or homicide. Among women, those dying from gun suicide were much more likely than controls to have purchased a handgun (OR 109.8; 95% CI 61.6 to 195.7). Handgun purchasers accounted for less than 1% of the study population but 2.4% of gun homicides, 14.2% of gun suicides, and 16.7% of unintentional gun deaths. Gun suicide made up 18.9% of deaths among purchasers but only 0.6% of deaths among non-purchasers.
   Conclusion: Among adults who died in California in 1998, those dying from violence were more likely than those dying from non-injury causes to have purchased a handgun.

AB Context: Suicide bereavement remains understudied and poorly understood.
   Objectives: To examine outcomes of parents bereaved by the suicide death of their offspring and to compare these with both nonbereaved parent controls and parents who had offspring die in a motor vehicle crash (MVC).
   Design: Population-based case-control study. Suicide-bereaved parents were compared with nonbereaved matched control parents in the general population (n = 1415) and with MVC-bereaved parents (n = 1132) on the rates of physician-diagnosed mental and physical disorders, social factors, and treatment use in the 2 years after death of the offspring. Adjusted relative rates (ARRs) were generated by generalized estimating equation models and adjusted for confounding factors.
   Setting: Manitoba, Canada.
   Participants: All identifiable parents who had an offspring die by suicide between 1996 and 2007 (n = 1415).
   Main Outcome Measures: Mental and physical disorders, social factors, and treatment use.
   Results: Suicide bereavement was associated with an increased rate of depression (ARR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.88-2.43), anxiety disorders (ARR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.24-1.60), and marital breakup (ARR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.13-1.23) in the 2 years after the suicide of an offspring, as compared with the 2 years prior to the death. Suicide-bereaved and MVC-bereaved parents had very few differences on predeath to postdeath outcomes. Depression rate increases were greater for MVC-bereaved parents (19.9%) compared with suicide-bereaved parents (15.9%; P = .005), whereas suicide-bereaved parents had higher rate increases of hospitalization for mental illness (P = .049). Suicide-bereaved parents were more likely than their MVC-bereaved counterparts to have depression (ARR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.06-1.61), physical disorders (ARR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.19-1.45), and low income (ARR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.18-1.51) before their offspring's death.
   Conclusions: Suicide bereavement is associated with adverse mental health and social outcomes. These consequences appear similar to those associated with MVC bereavement. Parents who lose offspring to suicide appear to be a vulnerable group even prior to their offspring's death. JAMA Psychiatry. 2013;70(2):158-167.

AB Background Physicians who receive a request for euthanasia or assisted suicide may experience a conflict of duties: the duty to preserve life on the one hand and the duty to relieve suffering on the other hand. Little is known about experiences of physicians with receiving and granting a request for euthanasia or assisted suicide. This study, therefore, aimed to explore the concerns, feelings and pressure experienced by physicians who receive requests for euthanasia or assisted suicide. Methods In 2016, a cross-sectional study was conducted. Questionnaires were sent to a random sample of 3000 Dutch physicians. Physicians who had been working in adult patient care in the Netherlands for the last year were included in the sample (n = 2657). Half of the physicians were asked about the most recent case in which they refused a request for euthanasia or assisted suicide, and half about the most recent case in which they granted a request for euthanasia or assisted suicide. Results Of the 2657 eligible physicians, 1374 (52%) responded. The most reported reason not to participate was lack of time. Of the respondents, 248 answered questions about a refused euthanasia or assisted suicide request and 245 about a granted EAS request. Concerns about specific aspects of the euthanasia and assisted suicide process, such as the emotional burden of preparing and performing euthanasia or assisted suicide were commonly reported by physicians who refused and who granted a request. Pressure to grant a request was mostly experienced by physicians who refused a request, especially if the patient was >= 80 years, had a life-expectancy of >= 6 months and did not have cancer. The large majority of physicians reported contradictory emotions after having performed euthanasia or assisted suicide. Conclusions Society should be aware of the impact of euthanasia and assisted suicide requests on physicians. The tension physicians experience may decrease their willingness to perform euthanasia and assisted suicide. On the other hand, physicians should not be forced to cross their own moral boundaries or be tempted to perform euthanasia and assisted suicide in cases that may not meet the due care criteria.

AB Background: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth are more than twice as likely to attempt suicide than their peers. Although LGBT-specific crisis services have been developed, little is known about the need for these services beyond that of general lifeline services. Aims: The present study sought to (a) describe the primary reasons for calling a specialized provider as opposed to another and (b) examine sociodemographic differences in the primary reason by race, ethnicity, gender, age, and sexual orientation. Method: Data from 657 youth who sought crisis services from an LGBT-specific national service provider in the United States were assessed. Logistic regression models assessed demographic differences.Thematic analysis of open-ended responses regarding reasons for choosing this LGBT-specific crisis service provider followed a consensus model. Results: Most respondents indicated they either would not have contacted another helpline (26%) or were not sure (48%). Nearly half (42%) indicated they called specifically because of LGBT-affirming counselors, a reason more commonly reported by gender minority (transgender and gender nonbinary) and queer or pansexual youth than cisgender, gay, or lesbian youth. Conclusion: LGBT-specific crisis services appear to play an important rote in suicide prevention. Further research is needed to understand the use of culturally tailored suicide prevention approaches.

AB Objectives To determine racial differences and trends in pediatric injury hospitalization rates in a rural state. Methods Hospital inpatient discharge data (2009-2014) for South Dakota residents aged 0-19 years were used to calculate annual hospitalization rates due to injuries. Race-, age-, and sex-specific rates were calculated, and trends over time were determined. Results Between 2009 and 2014, there were 3701 pediatric hospitalizations (1008 American Indian [AI]; 2303 white) due to injuries at an average rate of 269/100,000 (95% CI 260-280/100,000). Injury hospitalization rates were higher for AI than white children (532 vs. 213 per 100,000, respectively; p < 0.001). Rates for both AI and white children increased between 2009 and 2014 (both, p < 0.001). Suicide attempts were the predominant manner of injury in both the 10-14- and 15-19-year age groups, with AI adolescents having 3.5 and 3.2 times higher rates than white adolescents. Among AI adolescents aged 15 to 19 years, hospitalizations due to homicide-related injuries were 12.6 times higher than that of white children. Injury hospitalization rates among females recently exceeded that of males, due primarily to an increase in attempted suicides. Mechanism and nature of hospitalized injuries were consistent with the high rate of suicide-related admissions. Conclusion South Dakota AI children have disproportionately higher hospitalization rates due to unintentional and attempted suicide- and homicide-related injuries, and the rate differences between AI and white children are increasing over time. Injury hospitalization rates among females have increased more rapidly and recently surpassed that of males.

AB Objectives: To compare the sociodemographic characteristics of firearms suicide decedents and other suicide decedents in the Republic of Ireland between 1980 and 2005.
   Study design: A cross-sectional study of sociodemographic characteristics of those who committed suicide with a firearm and those who committed suicide by an alternative method.
   Methods: Suicide data from 1980 to 2005 inclusive, provided by the Central Statistics Office of Ireland, were analysed. For the purpose of this paper, suicide method was collapsed into two group's: firearm-assisted suicide (FAS) and non-firearm-assisted suicide (n-FAS). Differences in gender, marital status (married vs not married), area of residence (urban vs rural), agri-employment (agri-employed vs not agri-employed) and age were examined between the two groups. A logistic regression is presented using suicide method (FAS vs n-FAS) as the criterion variable and individual factors as predictors.
   Results: In total, 9674 suicides were recorded from 1 January 1980 to 31 December 2005. Seven hundred and ninety-three of these were FAS and 8881 were n-FAS. For both suicide profiles, the deceased were predominantly male, living in a rural setting and not married. However, this profile was more salient in the FAS group. In comparison with the n-FAS group, a greater proportion of the FAS decedents were male [chi(2)(1) = 152.5, P <= 0.0001, odds ratio (OR) = 4.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.4-6.1], from a rural setting [chi(2)(1) = 153.5, P <= 0.0001, OR = 4.4, 95%CI 3.2-5.6) and agri-employed [chi(2)(1) = 21.3, P <= 0.0001, OR = 1.5, 95%CI 1.3-1.8). FAS decedents were significantly younger than n-FAS victims, although the size of this effect was small (z = -8.4, P < 0.0005, r = -0.1). There was no difference in marital status between the two groups.
   Conclusions: Risk factors for FAS should inform policy-making in this area, with particular attention paid to protecting young males resident in rural settings. Consideration should be given to targeting agri-employed individuals as a specific at-risk group. (C) 2010 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND Gun buyback programs aim to remove unwanted firearms from the community with the goal of preventing firearm injury and death. Buyback programs are held in many communities, but evidence demonstrating their effectiveness is lacking. The purpose of this study is to compare firearms collected at buyback events to crime guns and firearms used in homicides and suicides.
   METHODS Detailed firearm and case data were obtained from the Hartford Police Department and the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner from January through December of 2015. Information was reviewed for guns collected at buyback events, crime guns confiscated by police, and for weapons associated with firearm fatalities. Detailed firearm data included type, manufacturer, model, and caliber (small, 0.32 caliber; medium, 0.357 caliber to 9 mm; large, 0.40 caliber). (2) analyses were used for comparisons between groups.
   RESULTS In 2015, 224 crime guns were seized by the Hartford Police, 169 guns were collected at four community buyback events, and there were 187 firearm-related deaths statewide (105 suicides, 81 homicides, 1 legal intervention). Comparisons between buyback, crime, and fatality-related firearms are shown in the table below. Medium caliber handguns account for the majority of crime guns and fatalities, and buyback programs collected smaller caliber handguns. The demographics of individuals who turn in guns at buyback events and commit suicide are similar: age (buyback, 63 11; suicide, 52 18; homicide, 34 +/- 12 years), sex (buyback, 81%; suicide, 91%; homicide, 84% men), and race (buyback, 80%; suicide, 97%; homicide, 47% white).
   CONCLUSION Handguns account for the majority of crime guns and firearm-related fatalities in Connecticut. Buyback programs are both an opportunity to remove unwanted handguns from the community and to remove firearms from the homes of individuals at increased risk of suicide.

AB Purpose: This article describes epidemiologic evidence concerning risk of gun violence and suicide linked to psychiatric disorders, in contrast to media-fueled public perceptions of the dangerousness of mentally ill individuals, and evaluates effectiveness of policies and laws designed to prevent firearms injury and mortality associated with serious mental illnesses and substance use disorders.
   Methods: Research concerning public attitudes toward persons with mental illness is reviewed and juxtaposed with evidence from benchmark epidemiologic and clinical studies of violence and mental illness and of the accuracy of psychiatrists' risk assessments. Selected policies and laws designed to reduce gun violence in relation to mental illness are critically evaluated; evidence-based policy recommendations are presented.
   Results: Media accounts of mass shootings by disturbed individuals galvanize public attention and reinforce popular belief that mental illness often results in violence. Epidemiologic studies show that the large majority of people with serious mental illnesses are never violent. However, mental illness is strongly associated with increased risk of suicide, which accounts for over half of US firearms-related fatalities.
   Conclusions: Policymaking at the interface of gun violence prevention and mental illness should be based on epidemiologic data concerning risk to improve the effectiveness, feasibility, and fairness of policy initiatives. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Prior literature reporting increased rates of firearm-related homicide and suicide with increasing firearm availability is limited by only examining the availability of firearms, which is only one component of firearm-related mortality. The objective of the current study is to separate the rates into their respective components and determine which components contribute to mortality rate changes. To address the objective, nationally representative data from 2001 to 2012 was collected from a variety of publicly-available sources. Utilizing decompositional methodology, a negative binomial regression was used to estimate rate ratios for the association between the components and year category, and relative contributions of each component were calculated. From 2001 to 2012, the homicide and unintentional mortality rate decreased while the suicide rate increased. The suicide rate was only the firearm prevalence rate. The unintentional mortality rate was a factor of firearm prevalence, injury incidence, and case fatality rate. The homicide rate was a factor of firearm prevalence, violent crime rate, injury incidence, and case fatality rate. The current results suggest that the contributors of changes in firearm-related mortality are multi-faceted. Future studies should perform a decompositional analysis utilizing more granular data to examine whether the currently reported results are true associations or a factor of ecologic fallacy.

AB Higher BMI has been associated with a lower risk of suicide in large prospective studies, but the mechanisms for this link require elucidation. In the 2002 and 2004 iterations of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a large, population-based telephone survey of US adults conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, participants reported their height, weight, and several potential risk factors for suicide, including alcohol use, mental health, marital status, firearm ownership, and risk-taking behaviors. We assessed whether BMI was associated with these risk factors among 224,247 eligible respondents in 2002 and 275,194 in 2004 after sample-weighted adjustment for age, race, region, smoking, and education. Alcohol-related risk factors tended to be lower with heavier BMI among women, while firearm-related risk factors tended to be higher with heavier BMI among men. Heavier BMI also tended to be associated with unmarried status and poor mental health, especially among women, and with infrequent seat belt use in men and women. No potential risk factors were consistently inversely associated with BMI in both sexes and years. In summary, in these samples of the US population, conventional risk factors for suicide were inconsistently associated with BMI, making them unlikely mediators for the observed relationship of BMI with lower risk of suicide. In some cases, risk factors were actually greater with heavier BMI. Further study of the relationship of BMI and suicide may yield novel modifiable risk factors that could cause or prevent this important cause of death.

TI Factors Associated With Suicide Outcomes 12 Months After Screening
   Positive for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department
SO PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES
LA English
DT Article
ID PHYSICAL ILLNESS
AB Objective: The main objective was to identify which patient characteristics have the strongest association with suicide outcomes in the 12 months after an index emergency department (ED) visit.
   Methods: Data were analyzed fromthe first two phases of the Emergency Department Safety Assessment and Follow-up Evaluation (ED-SAFE). The ED-SAFE study, a quasi-experimental, interrupted time-series design, involved participation from eight general medical EDs across the United States. Participants included adults presenting to the ED with active suicidal ideation or an attempt in the past week. Data collection included baseline interview; six-and 12-month chart reviews; and six-, 12-, 24-, 36-, and 52-week telephone follow-up assessments. Regression analyses were conducted.
   Results: Among 874 participants, the median age was 37 years (interquartile range 27-47), with 56% of the sample being female (N=488), 74% white (N=649), and 13% Hispanic (N=113). At baseline, 577 (66%) participants had suicidal ideation only, whereas 297 (34%) had a suicide attempt in the past week. Data sufficient to determine outcomes were available for 782 (90%). In the 12 months after the index ED visit, 195 (25%) had documentation of at least one suicide attempt or suicide. High school education or less, an ED visit in the preceding six months, prior nonsuicidal self-injury, current alcohol misuse, and suicidal intent or plan were predictive of future suicidal behavior.
   Conclusions: Continuing to build an understanding of the factors associated with future suicidal behaviors for this population will help guide design and implementation of improved suicide screening and interventions in the ED and better allocation of scarce resources.

AB Background To assess the influence of visual acuity (VA) on suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and depression.
   Methods From 2008 to 2012, a total of 28 919 nationally representative participants aged 19 years or older in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey underwent additional ophthalmological examinations by the Korean Ophthalmologic Society. Associations between best corrected VA in the better-seeing eye based on decimal fraction and mental health were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis after adjusting for possible biopsychosocial confounders. Self-reported mental health (suicidal ideation, suicide attempt and depression), Euro Quality of Life-Visual Analog Scale and counselling experience were evaluated by direct interviews. A nomogram for risk of suicidal ideation was generated.
   Results By multivariable logistic regression analysis, low VA was significantly associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempt but not depression. Participants with a VA of no light perception to 0.2 had a nearly twofold and threefold increased risk of suicidal ideation (adjusted OR, 1.85; 95% CI 1.04 to 3.27) and suicidal attempt (adjusted OR, 3.44; 95% CI 0.92 to 12.79), compared with participants with a VA of 1.0. Sociodemographic disparities, including age and socioeconomic status, existed for suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt and depression. Euro Quality of Life-Visual Analog Scale significantly decreased as VA decreased and was lower in participants who attempted suicide.
   Conclusions Low VA was associated with the occurrence of suicidal ideation or a suicide attempt. Ophthalmologists should embrace their responsibility to help reduce suicidality and prevent suicides in patients with low VA by encouraging them to seek psychiatric care.

AB Objective: African Americans have less use of antidepressants than whites, suggesting racial differences in the diagnosis and treatment of mood disorders. This study assessed whether this racial disparity is present among patients with a very high risk of severe mood disorders - that is, those with completed suicides. Methods: Completed suicides that occurred between 1986 and 2004 were identified by examining records of Tennessee Medicaid/ TennCare enrollees aged 18 to 84 years who had no serious medical illness or chronic psychosis. Use of antidepressants in the 365 days before the suicide was ascertained from filled prescriptions. Unconditional logistic regression was used to adjust for racial differences in demographic characteristics and somatic comorbidity. Results: The study included 127 African Americans and 1,379 whites who completed suicide. African Americans had significantly reduced odds of receiving treatments for mood disorders in the year preceding the suicide: 29% of African Americans had filled an antidepressant prescription, compared with 51% of whites ( adjusted odds ratio=.43, 95% confidence interval=.26-.71, p<. 001). In contrast, there was no significant difference between the two racial groups in the proportions filling prescriptions for antipsychotic medications ( 13% of African Americans and 11% of whites). These findings persisted after the analysis controlled for other comorbidities linked with suicide, including alcohol or substance abuse, seizure disorders, borderline personality disorder, and serious neurological conditions. Conclusions: Although there are several other potential explanations, the study findings provide indirect evidence that there is underdiagnosis or undertreatment of African Americans with serious mood disorders. Further research on this question in African-American populations is essential.

AB Background: Suicide is a critical public health problem around the globe. Asian populations are characterized by elevated suicide rates and a tendency to seek social support from family and friends over mental health professionals. Gatekeeper training programs have been developed to train frontline individuals in behaviors that assist at-risk individuals in obtaining mental health treatment. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a brief, multi-component gatekeeper intervention in promoting suicide prevention in a high-risk Asian community in the United States.
   Methods: We adapted an evidence-based gatekeeper training into a two-hour, multi-modal and interactive event for Japanese-Americans and related stakeholders. Then we evaluated the intervention compared to an attention control using mixed methods.
   Results: A sample of 106 community members participated in the study. Intervention participants (n = 85) showed significant increases in all three types of intended gatekeeper behavior, all four measures of self-efficacy, and both measures of social norms relevant to suicide prevention, while the control group (n = 48) showed no significant improvements. Additional results showed significantly higher satisfaction and no adverse experiences associated with the gatekeeper training. The separate collection of qualitative data, and integration with the quantitative survey constructs confirmed and expanded understanding about the benefits of the intervention.
   Conclusions: A brief, multi-modal gatekeeper training is efficacious in promoting positive gatekeeper behaviors and self-efficacy for suicide prevention in an at-risk ethnic minority population of Japanese Americans.

AB Background: We report prospective associations of baseline risk factors with the first onset and persistence of suicide-related outcomes (SROs; ideation, plans, gestures, and attempts) over a 10-year interval among respondents who participated in both the 1990-02 National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) and the 2000-02 National Comorbidity Survey follow-up (NCS-2).
   Methods: A total of 5001 NCS respondents were re-interviewed (87.6% of baseline sample) in the NCS-2. Three sets of baseline (NCS) risk factors were considered as predictors of the first onset and persistence of SROs: socio-demographics, lifetime DSM-III-R disorders, and SROs.
   Results: New onsets included 6.2% suicide ideation, 2.3% plan, 0.7% gesture, and 0.9% attempts. More than one-third of respondents with a baseline history of suicide ideation continued to have suicide ideation at some time over the intervening decade. Persistence was lower for other SROs. The strongest predictors of later SROs were baseline SROs. Prospective associations of baseline mental disorders with later SROs were largely limited to the onset and persistence of ideation.
   Limitations: Although data were gathered prospectively, they were based on retrospective reports at both baseline and follow-up.
   Conclusions: Baseline history of SROs explained much of the association of mental disorders with later SROs. It is important clinically to note that many of the risk factors known to predict onset of SROs also predict persistence of SROs. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Some small studies have reported high risk of suicide after surgical treatment for peptic ulcer. The aim of the present study was to explore the risk of suicide in hospitalised gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer patients separately among operated and non-operated cohorts.
   Methods: Retrospective cohorts of 163 579 non-operated patients with gastric ulcer or duodenal ulcer and 28 112 patients with surgical treatment for ulcer, recorded in the Swedish Inpatient Register since 1965, were followed from the first hospitalisation, or operation for the surgery cohort, until death, any cancer, emigration, or 31 December 2003. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated, and Poisson regression produced adjusted relative risk estimates among operated and non-operated patients.
   Results: Non-operated patients hospitalised for peptic ulcer showed a 70% excess risk of suicide (SMR 1.7, 95% CI 1.6 to 1.9) and those who underwent operation had a 60% increased risk (SMR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4 to 1.8). The risk of suicide was very high during the first year after hospitalisation (SMR 4.0, 95% CI 3.4 to 4.7) and more marked among women, patients under 70 and patients hospitalised without complications of ulcer. Both gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer patients had high risk of suicide completion.
   Conclusion: Hospitalised patients with gastric ulcer or duodenal ulcer have an increased risk of suicide regardless of surgical treatment. These patients, especially women, are at very high risk during the first year after first hospitalisation/operation. The evaluation and management of suicidal thoughts in patients in medical settings should be further considered.

TI The Accessibility of Firearms and Risk for Suicide and Homicide
   Victimization Among Household Members
SO ANNALS OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Review
ID UNITED-STATES; VIOLENT DEATH; ADOLESCENT SUICIDE; YOUTH SUICIDE;
   GENDER-GAP; GUN; ACCESS; MORTALITY; FATALITIES; RATES
AB Background: Research suggests that access to firearms in the home increases the risk for violent death.
   Purpose: To understand current estimates of the association between firearm availability and suicide or homicide.
   Data Sources: PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science were searched without limitations and a gray-literature search was performed on 23 August 2013.
   Study Selection: All study types that assessed firearm access and outcomes between participants with and without firearm access. There were no restrictions on age, sex, or country.
   Data Extraction: Two authors independently extracted data into a standardized, prepiloted data extraction form.
   Data Synthesis: Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were calculated, although published adjusted estimates were preferentially used. Summary effects were estimated using random-and fixed-effects models. Potential methodological reasons for differences in effects through subgroup analyses were explored. Data were pooled from 15 observational studies that assessed the odds of suicide or homicide, yielding pooled ORs of 3.24 (95% CI, 2.41 to 4.40) and 1.94 (CI, 1.44 to 2.93), respectively. When only studies that used interviews to determine firearm accessibility were considered, the pooled OR for suicide was 3.14 (CI, 2.29 to 4.43).
   Limitations: Firearm accessibility was determined by survey interviews in most studies; misclassification of accessibility may have occurred. Heterogeneous populations of varying risks were synthesized to estimate pooled odds of death.
   Conclusion: Access to firearms is associated with risk for completed suicide and being the victim of homicide.

AB Background: Suicidal behavior is a major cause of injury and death worldwide, especially among adolescents and young adults. Few studies have tackled this issue in the Arab world. The present study investigated the prevalence and the risk factors of suicidal behaviors among Moroccan school students.
   Methods: From April 2012 to November 2013, a cross-sectional study was conducted in the North-Centre region of Morocco among students in public secondary schools selected using stratified cluster random sampling. The data were collected via anonymous self-administered questionnaires. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview was used in its Moroccan Colloquial Arabic version to assess suicidality according to the DSM-IV criteria.
   Results: A total of 3020 students (53 % boys) aged 11-23 years (average age = 16 +/- 2.1 years) were included in the study. The prevalence of suicide ideation, suicide planning and suicide attempts during the last month were 15.7, 6.3, and 6.5 % respectively.
   Univariate analyses demonstrated that suicidal behaviors followed different epidemiological patterns. According to the multivariate analyses, the risk factors for all suicidal behaviors among Moroccan school students were the female gender, middle school level, urban locations, low family income, parents' divorce, tobacco consumption and psychoactive substances (alcohol and cannabis) use.
   Conclusions: The intervention of preventive programs has become an emergency to overcome the issue of suicidality in Morocco. Further researches on adolescents' suicidal behaviors are suggested to update temporal data and assess the effectiveness of potential interventions.

AB Objective: Antipsychotics are commonly used in bipolar disorder, with newer (SGA) agents increasingly replacing FGA antipsychotics, particularly in bipolar depression. There are few data on differences between FGA and SGA antipsychotics in terms of their relationship to suicidal behavior in bipolar disorder.
   Method: This was a retrospective chart review of 161 bipolar veterans treated naturalistically with antipsychotics at a university-affiliated VA hospital and clinics for up to 8 years. Charts were reviewed to determine monthly antipsychotic use and occurrence of suicidal behavior: completed suicide, attempted suicide or hospitalization to prevent suicide. Suicidal behavior events were compared across patients during treatment with individual antipsychotics and FGAs or SGAs as a class.
   Results: Non-lethal suicide events were more common during FGA than SGA monotherapy (9 events/110 months of exposure vs. 6 events/381 months of exposure; chi(2)=9.65, p=0.002). Suicide event rates did not differ between FGAs and SGAs when used in conjunction with mood stabilizers. Event rates were lower with lithium than anticonvulsants when used in conjunction with antipsychotics. No differences were found between olanzapine, risperidone and quetiapine.
   Limitations: The retrospective chart review methodology may have led to confounding by indication and diagnostic inaccuracy. No completed suicides occurred. Study participants were primarily male veterans. Results may not be generalizable to SGAs marketed since 2003.
   Conclusions: FGA antipsychotic monotherapy may be associated with higher suicidal behavior risk than SGA antipsychotic monotherapy. Antipsychotics used in conjunction with mood stabilizers, particularly lithium, are associated with lower rates, independent of antipsychotic subtype. Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID PSYCHACHE SCALE; DELTA POWER; RISK; VALIDATION; DEPRESSION; HISTORY;

AB Background. Assessing psychological pain has been recommended as an integral part of a comprehensive suicide risk assessment. The Psychache Scale, an established measure of psychological pain, does not specify a time frame for when pain is experienced, which may inadvertently increase the likelihood of identifying individuals as being at elevated suicide risk when they complete the Psychache Scale based on psychological pain experienced at some undefined time in the past.
   Methods. We conducted a national general population survey among United States adults to determine whether addition of a time frame to the instructions of the Psychache Scale would more accurately reflect current psychological pain and more effectively identify people with current suicide ideation. A between-subjects design was used where respondents were randomized to complete the original Psychache scale or a modified scale with time frame. Data were collected online from September 2015 to June 2016. A total of 242 respondents had complete psychological pain data: 133 completed the original Psychache Scale and 109 completed the Psychache Scale with time frame.
   Results. Addition of a time frame did not result in differences in psychological pain scores. However, when screening for participants with current suicide ideation, 13% fewer false positives were observed with the modified scale at higher cut-off values than previously reported (38 vs. 24). The substantial increase in positive predictive value suggests that a time frame is a worthwhile addition to the Psychache Scale.
   Discussion. We recommend using the Psychache Scale with a time frame and testing the cut-off score for suicide ideation in population samples that reflect the general population more accurately. Psychological pain cut-off scores in clinical samples have yet to be established.

AB Objective: To evaluate the relationship between dating violence, sexual assault, and suicide attempts among urban adolescents.
   Design: Secondary analysis of the 2005 New York City Youth Risk Behavior Survey.
   Setting: Eighty-seven New York City public high schools.
   Participants: Representative population-based sample of 8080 students, 14 years and older.
   Main Exposures: Dating violence in the past year and lifetime history of sexual assault.
   Outcome Measure: One or more suicide attempts in the past year.
   Results: Respondents were 50.0% female and primarily black (36.0%) or Hispanic (40.1%). In the past year, 11.7% of females and 7.2% of males reported 1 or more suicide attempts. Lifetime history of sexual assault was reported by 9.6% of females and 5.4% of males. Dating violence in the past year was reported by 10.6% of females and 9.5% of males. In multivariate models, controlling for persistent sadness, sexual orientation, and significant. risk behaviors, recent dating violence (odds ratio, 1.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-2.47) was associated with suicide attempts in adolescent girls, while lifetime history of sexual assault (odds ratio, 3.86; 95% confidence interval, 2.11-7.06) was associated with suicide attempts in adolescent boys.
   Conclusions: In this population of urban youth, recent dating violence among females and lifetime history of sexual assault among males were significantly associated with suicide attempts. Clinicians and educators should be trained to routinely screen adolescents for violence victimization and should have a low threshold for referring these at-risk teenagers for mental health services.

AB In Europe the elderly population is projected to increase from 18.5% (93.9 million) in 2014 to 28.7% (149.1 million) by 2080. In the United States it is estimated that by 2030 more than 20% of the population will be aged 65 years or over. This specific population is at high risk of unrecognized or untreated psychiatric illnesses and suicide. It is well known that completed suicide rate increases with age in both men and women. Although elderly people attempt suicide less often than other age groups, they show a higher completion rate. Generally, the methods chosen by elderly are more lethal, the intent is more serious, they are more determined, and they show fewer warning signs than the younger population. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of psychosocial intervention, following self-harm in adults, found that cognitive behavioral therapy was the most effective therapy in these patients. Unfortunately, there have been few reported trials of other potentially effective interventions. Because the scientific literature on psychosocial suicide prevention interventions in the elderly is still scant, we conducted a mini-review in order to take stock of the situation. Studies were identified through electronic searches of the Cochrane library, MEDLINE, Scopus and the Web of Science databases. PRISMA guidelines were followed and only seven articles met the inclusion criteria. No firm conclusions can be drawn about this topic because there is still very little data and studies use inconsistent outcome measures and designs. Nonetheless, the existing data suggests that psychosocial interventions are promising.

ID UNITED-STATES; CARE; DISORDERS; ACCESS; PSYCHIATRISTS; PATTERNS; RISK
AB Objective: Evidence shows that access to mental health services may have an impact on mental health outcomes such as suicide rates. This small-area analysis examined whether the availability of professionals providing mental health treatment in Austria had an effect on regional suicide rates. Methods: A hierarchical Bayesian model accounting for spatially correlated random effects using an intrinsic conditional autoregressive prior that incorporated the neighborhood structure of districts and that assumed a Poisson distribution for the observed number of suicides was used to estimate the effects of access to mental health care (population density of general practitioners, psychiatrists, and psychotherapists) in Austria. Results: Regional socioeconomic factors were correlated with the density of psychiatrists and psychotherapists. Only the number of psychotherapists per 10,000 population had a significant effect on suicide rates (relative risk [RR]=.97, 95% confidence interval [CI]=.94-.997, and absolute risk reduction [ARR]=-.62, CI=-1.20 to -.11); however, after adjustment for socioeconomic factors (in particular urbanicity as indicated by population density, average income, and proportion of non-Catholics), the observed effects were no longer significant. In the final model, only the socioeconomic component remained significant (RR=.94, CI=.88-.99), and ARR=-1.17, CI=-2.34 to -.05). Conclusions: The availability of specialized mental health service providers was associated with regional socioeconomic factors, and these factors appeared to be stronger predictors of suicide rates than the availability of providers. Therefore, suicide prevention efforts need to acknowledge that availability of services is only one aspect of access to care; a more influential factor is whether availability satisfies local demand.

AB Objective: There are no previous studies describing the correlates of suicide attempts in individuals with major depressive disorder in a nationally representative sample. This study explores the sociodemographic variables, mental disorders, and specific depressive symptoms associated with suicide attempts in depression.
   Method: Data were drawn from Wave I of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), a large (N = 43,093) nationally representative survey of mental illness in the United States conducted between 2001 and 2002. Persons with lifetime major depressive disorder (N = 5128; diagnosed according to DSM-IV) were categorized according to the presence (N = 865) or absence (N = 4263) of a lifetime history of suicide attempts. Multivariate logistic regression was used to compare the 2 groups across a broad range of sociodemographic and mental disorder correlates, as well as to compare specific depressive symptoms associated with a history of suicide attempts. Positive predictive values (PPVs) were calculated to evaluate the effectiveness of each correlate in predicting suicide attempts. Analyses were conducted separately for men and women.
   Results: Sociodemographic factors significantly associated with a history of suicide attempts included Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (p < .05), younger age (p < .01), and low annual income (p < .01). A history of suicide attempt was significantly associated with any anxiety, personality, or substance use disorder among both men and women (all p < .01). Personality disorder comorbidity was most predictive of suicide attempt. In men, suicide attempts had a strong association with dependent personality disorder (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.81; 95% CI = 1.14 to 12.73), whereas in women, suicide attempts had a strong association with antisocial personality disorder (AOR = 2.71; 95% CI = 1.72 to 4.25). Dependent personality disorder predicted suicide attempt in almost three quarters of depressed men (PPV = 74.3%; 95% CI = 54.2 to 87.6). The depressive symptom most strongly associated with a history of suicide attempts in both men and women was feelings of worthlessness (AOR = 5.48, 95% CI = 3.36 to 8.94 for men; AOR = 4.93, 95% CI = 3.56 to 6.84 for women).
   Conclusions: This study contributes to the existing literature on risk factors for suicide attempts in depressed individuals. Identifying specific depressive symptoms and comorbid mental illnesses may improve the clinical assessment of suicide risk in people with major depressive disorder.

AB Objective: To investigate the rate of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), to describe sociodemographic and clinical correlates of NSSI, and to examine the association of NSSI with suicidal thoughts and behaviors in a sample of U. S. military personnel and veterans. Method: An anonymous online survey was completed by 335 U. S. military personnel and veterans (70.0% male; age mean = 36.67, standard error = 10.59; 82.3% Caucasian, 4.9% African American, 2.8% Asian, 3.7% Native American, 1.2% Pacific Islander, and 7.6% other) enrolled in college classes. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and logistic regression was used to test the associations among NSSI, suicide ideation, suicide planning, and suicide attempts. Results: Fourteen percent of the sample reported lifetime NSSI and 3% reported NSSI during the last 12 months. The most common method was cutting (78.7%), with 66% reporting use of 2 or more methods for NSSI. Average age of NSSI onset was 17.55 years. Increased likelihood of NSSI was associated with older age, shorter length of time in service, greater trauma exposure, female gender, Native American racial identity, and combat support deployments. Personnel in the Navy and with a history of combat deployment were significantly less likely to report NSSI. NSSI was significantly associated with suicide ideation, suicide planning, and suicide attempts even when adjusting for covariates. Conclusion: The rate of NSSI is comparable to estimates in nonmilitary U.S. samples. NSSI is a significant risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors in this group.

AB Prior research has shown associations between opioid misuse and suicidal behaviors, but the relationship between medical opioid use and suicidal behaviors is not known. We assessed associations of opioid use and misuse with suicidal ideation, suicide plans, and suicide attempts among adults aged 18-64 years (n = 86,186) using nationally representative cross-sectional data from the 2015 and 2016 administrations of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. We used logistic regression to estimate associations between opioid use/misuse and suicidal behaviors and propensity score-weighted logistic regression analysis to examine the counterfactual scenario in which persons with misuse had instead not misused opioids. In propensity score-weighted analyses, compared with opioid misuse, opioid use without misuse was associated with lower odds of suicidal ideation (odds ratio (OR) = 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.45, 0.72) and suicide plans (OR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.35, 0.80), and no use was associated with lower odds of suicidal ideation (OR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.49, 0.80), suicide plans (OR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.79), and suicide attempts (OR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.33, 0.89). These findings suggest that opioid misuse is associated with greater odds of suicidal behaviors, but opioid use without misuse is not. Compared with persons with opioid misuse, similar persons without misuse have a reduced risk of suicidal behaviors. Clinical and public health interventions should focus on preventing misuse of opioids.

AB Objective: To estimate the cumulative incidence of self-reported suicide-related thoughts (SRTs) and suicide attempts (SAs) in males and females from 11 to 25 years of age in Canada. Methods: A cohort study was conducted by linking cycles 2 to 8 from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth, a representative survey of Canadians aged 11 to 25 years conducted from 1996 to 2009. The 11- to 25-year cumulative incidence of self-reported SRTs and SAs (with suicidal intent) was estimated in males and females using a novel application of a counting process approach to account for discontinuous risk intervals between survey cycles. Results: The risk of SRTs was 29% (95% confidence interval [CI], 26% to 31%) in females and 19% (95% CI, 16% to 23%) in males. The risk of SAs was 16% (95% CI, 14% to 19%) in females and 7% (95% CI, 6% to 8%) in males. Over 70% of SRTs and SAs first occur between 11 and 16 years of age and 30% between 11 and 13 years of age, respectively. Conclusions: The risk of SRTs and SAs is high in young Canadians, with most events first occurring in early to mid-adolescence and possibly earlier. Females are at a higher risk compared to males. This research underscores the need for better longitudinal surveillance of SRTs and SAs in the population. A counting process framework could be useful for future research using existing longitudinal surveys suffering from design limitations relating to gaps in respondent follow-up. Furthermore, these findings have implications for younger SRT and SA risk management by clinicians and earlier implementation of suicide prevention programs.

AB Background Methods With suicide rising in the United States, identifying and preventing suicides is increasingly important. To provide a valuable step toward achieving effective suicide risk assessment, this study examines the agreement between self-report measures and psychiatrist documentation of suicidal ideation and behaviors (SI) at a Veterans Administration (VA) psychiatric emergency clinic. A total of 377 veterans presenting at a VA psychiatric emergency clinic completed a self-report survey on SI and other acute risk factors for suicidal behavior. We examined agreement between veterans' self-reported SI and psychiatrists' clinical notes regarding SI. Results Conclusions A total of 199 veterans (53%) self-reported SI; 80 psychiatrist notes (21%) indicated SI. Psychiatrists and veterans differed in 44% (164/377) of cases. Among the discordant cases, the veterans' self-report was more severe than the psychiatrists' in 97% of cases. Of the 120 veterans with SI and documented as having no SI by psychiatrists, 31 (26%) reported having a suicide plan and 18 (15%) plan preparations. Findings were similar when controlling for presenting problem, current depression, presence of a standardized suicide risk assessment, psychiatrist training level, past suicide attempt, homelessness, diagnosis of personality, or substance use disorder. Agreement between veterans' self-reports and psychiatrists' documentation of SI was generally low, with veterans self-reporting SI significantly more often than psychiatrists documented SI in their clinical notes. This suggests that inclusion of a self-report questionnaire provides an additional source of data to complement information gleaned from the clinical interview for a more comprehensive risk assessment, but only if actually examined by the clinician.

AB Clinicians have an obligation to report to state or territory police any concerns about risk of harm from patients with access to firearms.
   Dementia is an under-recognised medical problem which may increase the risk of firearm injury or violence in those with such access.
   There are no guidelines for clinicians regarding mandatory screening for access to firearms, and currently the onus is on the firearm licence holder to declare any relevant medical conditions.
   We propose that clinicians should screen patients for firearm possession and use a combined capacity and risk assessment approach to evaluating fitness for firearm licences.

TI Evaluating the Impact of Florida's "Stand Your Ground" Self-defense
   Lawon Homicide and Suicide by Firearm An Interrupted Time Series Study
SO JAMA INTERNAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID REGRESSION; CRIME; RACE
AB IMPORTANCE In 2005, Florida amended its self-defense laws to provide legal immunity to individuals using lethal force in self-defense. The enactment of "stand your ground" laws in the United States has been controversial and their effect on rates of homicide and homicide by firearm is uncertain.
   OBJECTIVE To estimate the impact of Florida's stand your ground law on rates of homicide and homicide by firearm.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Using an interrupted time series design, we analyzed monthly rates of homicide and homicide by firearm in Florida between 1999 and 2014. Data were collected from the Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) web portal at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We used seasonally adjusted segmented Poisson regression models to assess whether the onset of the law was associated with changes in the underlying trends for homicide and homicide by firearm in Florida. We also assessed the association using comparison states without stand your ground laws (New York, New Jersey, Ohio, and Virginia) and control outcomes (all suicides and suicides by firearm in Florida). October 1, 2005, the effective date of the law, was used to define homicides before and after the change.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Monthly rates of homicide, firearm-related homicide, suicide, and suicide by firearm in Florida and the 4 comparison states. RESULTS Prior to the stand your ground law, the mean monthly homicide rate in Florida was 0.49 deaths per 100 000 (mean monthly count, 81.93), and the rate of homicide by firearm was 0.29 deaths per 100 000 (mean monthly count, 49.06). Both rates had an underlying trend of 0.1% decrease per month. After accounting for underlying trends, these results estimate that after the law took effect there was an abrupt and sustained increase in the monthly homicide rate of 24.4%(relative risk [RR], 1.24; 95% CI, 1.16-1.33) and in the rate of homicide by firearm of 31.6%(RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.21-1.44). No evidence of change was found in the analyses of comparison states for either homicide (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.98-1.13) or homicide by firearm (RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.99-1.17). Furthermore, no changes were observed in control outcomes such as suicide (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.94-1.05) and suicide by firearm (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.91-1.06) in Florida between 2005 and 2014.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The implementation of Florida's stand your ground self-defense law was associated with a significant increase in homicides and homicides by firearm but no change in rates of suicide or suicide by firearm.

AB This article fills a need in the theoretical and clinical literature by presenting a set of guidelines for assessing mental capacity and impaired judgment when a person makes a request to have physician-assisted death. Because Oregon is the only state to have a law allowing physician-assisted death, the guidelines are placed within the context of the Oregon Death with Dignity Act. A comprehensive overview of the legal and clinical issues associated with the assessment of capacity precedes the actual guidelines.

AB Background
   Medical-related professions are at high suicide risk. However, data are contradictory and comparisons were not made between gender, occupation and specialties, epochs of times. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on suicide risk among healthcare workers.
   Method
   The PubMed, Cochrane Library, Science Direct and Embase databases were searched without language restriction on April 2019, with the following keywords: suicide* AND ("health care worker*" OR physician* OR nurse*). When possible, we stratified results by gender, countries, time, and specialties. Estimates were pooled using random-effect meta-analysis. Differences by study-level characteristics were estimated using stratified meta-analysis and meta-regression. Suicides, suicidal attempts, and suicidal ideation were retrieved from national or local specific registers or case records. In addition, suicide attempts and suicidal ideation were also retrieved from questionnaires (paper or internet).
   Results
   The overall SMR for suicide in physicians was 1.44 (95CI 1.16, 1.72) with an important heterogeneity (I-2 = 93.9%, p<0.001). Female were at higher risk (SMR = 1.9; 95CI 1.49, 2.58; and ES = 0.67; 95CI 0.19, 1.14; p<0.001 compared to male). US physicians were at higher risk (ES = 1.34; 95CI 1.28, 1.55; p < 0.001 vs Rest of the world). Suicide decreased over time, especially in Europe (ES = -0.18; 95CI -0.37, -0.01; p = 0.044). Some specialties might be at higher risk such as anesthesiologists, psychiatrists, general practitioners and general surgeons. There were 1.0% (95CI 1.0, 2.0; p<0.001) of suicide attempts and 17% (95CI 12, 21; p<0.001) of suicidal ideation in physicians. Insufficient data precluded meta-analysis on other health-care workers.
   Conclusion
   Physicians are an at-risk profession of suicide, with women particularly at risk. The rate of suicide in physicians decreased over time, especially in Europe. The high prevalence of physicians who committed suicide attempt as well as those with suicidal ideation should benefits for preventive strategies at the workplace. Finally, the lack of data on other health-care workers suggest to implement studies investigating those occupations.

AB Context Suicide is a leading cause of death in the United States, but identifying persons at risk is difficult. Thus, the US surgeon general has made suicide prevention a national priority. An expanding body of research suggests that childhood trauma and adverse experiences can lead to a variety of negative health outcomes, including attempted suicide among adolescents and adults.
   Objective To examine the relationship between the risk of suicide attempts and adverse childhood experiences and the number of such experiences (adverse childhood experiences [ACE] score).
   Design, Setting, and Participants A retrospective cohort study of 17337 adult health maintenance organization members (54% female; mean [SD] age, 57 [15.3] years) who attended a primary care clinic in San Diego, Calif, within a 3-year period (1995-1997) and completed a survey about childhood abuse and household dysfunction, suicide attempts (including age at first attempt), and multiple other health-related issues.
   Main Outcome Measure Self-reported suicide attempts, compared by number of adverse childhood experiences, including emotional, physical, and sexual abuse; household substance abuse, mental illness, and incarcerations and parental domestic violence, separation, or divorce.
   Results The lifetime prevalence of having at least 1 suicide attempt was 3.8%. Adverse childhood experiences in any category increased the risk of attempted suicide 2- to 5-fold. The ACE score had a strong, graded relationship to attempted suicide during child hood/adolescence and adulthood (P<.001). Compared with persons with no such experiences (prevalence of attempted suicide, 1.1%), the adjusted odds ratio of ever attempting suicide among persons with 7 or more experiences (35.2 %) was 31.1 (95% confidence interval, 20.6-47.1). Adjustment for illicit drug use, depressed affect, and self-reported alcoholism reduced the strength of the relationship between the ACE score and suicide attempts, suggesting partial mediation of the adverse childhood experience-suicide attempt relationship by these factors. The population-attributable risk fractions for 1 or more experiences were 67%, 64%, and 80% for lifetime, adult, and childhood/ adolescent suicide attempts, respectively.
   Conclusions A powerful graded relationship exists between adverse childhood experiences and risk of attempted suicide throughout the life span, Alcoholism, depressed affect, and illicit drug use, which are strongly associated with such experiences, appear to partially mediate this relationship. Because estimates of the attributable risk fraction caused by these experiences were large, prevention of these experiences and the treatment of persons affected by them may lead to progress in suicide prevention.

AB Background: Studies have shown that patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are at risk of experiencing suicidal ideation and suicide attempt. Study Design: The aim of the present review was to investigate whether there was a relationship between dialysis and suicide. A careful systematic review of the literature was conducted to determine the potential association between dialysis and suicide. Selection Criteria for Studies: Abstracts that did not explicitly mention suicide and dialysis were excluded. We identified as specific fields of interest in the analysis of dialysis or ESRD and suicidal behavior. Results: A total of 26 articles from peer-reviewed journals were considered and the most relevant articles (N = 13) were selected for this review. Outcomes: It has been posited that suicidal ideation, occurring in dialysis, may arise from co-morbid depression and psychiatric symptoms are frequent in patients who underwent dialysis. Limitations: The present review should be considered in the light of some limitations. We did not carry out a meta-analysis because data from most of the studies did not permit it. Samples included different measurements and different outcomes, and they assessed patients at different time points. Conclusions: The available data suggest that the risk of self-harmmay be higher than expected in dialysis patients especially in those who suffer by depression and anxiety. Moreover, although the majority of deaths among dialysis patients is preceded by withdrawal from treatment, suicide remains a separate phenomenon.

AB The treatment for penile cancer has been shown to cause harmful psychiatric symptoms as well as have detrimental effects on well-being. In the past several years, alternatives to total or partial penectomy have emerged, such as chemotherapy, radiation, penile sparing, and laser ablation therapies. A more specific breakdown for penile cancer is in order as the therapy has the potential for life changing surgery. We examined the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (1973-2013), comprising 28% of the United States population. International Classification of Diseases, Tenth revision codes C60.8-C60.9 and the International Classification of Diseases-Oncology codes 8010/2, 8010/3, 8051/2, 8051/3, 8052/2, 8052/3, 8070/2, 8070/3-8072/3, 8074/3, 8076/3, and 8083/3-8084/3 were used. Age, race, marital status, and clinicopathologic variables were studied. We used contingency tables of suicide rates; mid-P exact test was used for analysis. There were 13 suicides noted in 6155 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the penis. All patients that committed suicide had undergone a surgical intervention. Certainly, penile cancer after treatment has a powerful effect on quality of life as increased depression and sexual anxiety have been documented in postoperative patients. This is in contrast to the observed suicide rate. Despite the reported negative psychological effects in patients with penile cancer, suicide rates are among the lowest of all urologic malignancies.

AB Previous research has shown that antisocial, borderline, narcissistic and histrionic personality disorders, also known as the Cluster B personality disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fifth Edition (DSM-5), are commonly raised in lawsuits. Cluster B disorders are characterized by problems with emotion regulation, impulsivity and interpersonal conflicts. Without question, individuals diagnosed with a Cluster B disorder possess traits that make them more susceptible to becoming involved in litigation; however, to date there has been no research on how the disorders interact with the judicial system. This study surveyed litigant success of Cluster B personality disorders in United States federal and state case law. Results showed that both criminal and civil litigants tended to be unsuccessful in their cases. Overall, this study demonstrated that court opinions can provide a window into the psychology of trial litigants and how personality can affect trial outcomes.

DE Immobility; Inequality; Social Unrest
ID INCOME INEQUALITY; PANEL-DATA; VIOLENT CRIME; HEALTH
AB The empirical literature has not been successful in generating robust results for a positive relationship between income inequality and social unrest outcomes such as crime and suicide. This paper questions the use of standard income inequality measures (e.g., Gini coefficient) in such studies and shows that income-mobility-based measures are effective in explaining outcomes of social unrest. Analyses of Korean and the United States region-by-year data suggest that crime and suicide rates are better explained by income immobility (i.e., the degree of economic segregation) rather than the inequality aspects of income distribution. The explanatory power improves as a heavier weight is placed on the poor group's degree of immobility. Findings in the current study will be helpful for guiding future efforts to develop more effective measures of social unrest.

AB Drawing from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH; N = 611,880), a nationally representative survey of U.S. adolescents and adults, we assess age, period, and cohort trends in mood disorders and suicide-related outcomes since the mid-2000s. Rates of major depressive episode in the last year increased 52% 2005-2017 (from 8.7% to 13.2%) among adolescents aged 12 to 17 and 63% 2009-2017 (from 8.1% to 13.2%) among young adults 18-25. Serious psychological distress in the last month and suicide-related outcomes (suicidal ideation, plans, attempts, and deaths by suicide) in the last year also increased among young adults 18-25 from 2008-2017 (with a 71% increase in serious psychological distress), with less consistent and weaker increases among adults ages 26 and over. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses separating the effects of age, period, and birth cohort suggest the trends among adults are primarily due to cohort, with a steady rise in mood disorder and suicide-related outcomes between cohorts born from the early 1980s (Millennials) to the late 1990s (iGen). Cultural trends contributing to an increase in mood disorders and suicidal thoughts and behaviors since the mid-2000s, including the rise of electronic communication and digital media and declines in sleep duration, may have had a larger impact on younger people, creating a cohort effect.

AB Background: Considerable attention has been focused on the study of suicides among those who have received help from healthcare providers. However, little is known about the profiles of suicide deceased who had psychiatric illnesses but made no contact with psychiatric services prior to their death. Behavioural model of health service use is applied to identify factors associated with the utilization of psychiatric service among the suicide deceased.
   Methods: With respect to completed suicide cases, who were diagnosed with a mental disorder, a comparison study was made between those who had (contact group; n = 52; 43.7%) and those who had not made any contact (non-contact group; n = 67; 56.3%) with a psychiatrist during the final six months prior to death. A sample of 119 deceased cases aged between 15 and 59 with at least one psychiatric diagnosis assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (SCID I) were selected from a psychological autopsy study in Hong Kong.
   Results: The contact and non-contact group could be well distinguished from each other by "predisposing" variables: age group & gender, and most of the "enabling", and "need" variables tested in this study. Multiple logistic regression analysis has found four factors are statistically significantly associated with non-contact suicide deceased: (i) having non-psychotic disorders (OR = 13.5, 95% CI: 2.9-62.9), (ii) unmanageable debts (OR = 10.5, CI: 2.4-45.3), (iii) being full/partially/self employed at the time of death (OR = 10.0, CI: 1.6-64.1) and (iv) having higher levels of social problem-solving ability (SPSI) (OR = 2.0, CI: 1.1-3.6).
   Conclusion: The non-contact group was clearly different from the contact group and actually comprised a larger proportion of the suicide population that they could hardly be reached by usual individual-based suicide prevention efforts. For this reason, both universal and strategic suicide prevention measures need to be developed specifically in non-medical settings to reach out to this non-contact group in order to achieve better suicide prevention results.

ID MENTAL-HEALTH-CARE; IDEATION; STIGMA; VETERANS; BARRIERS; RISK
AB Objectives: Increasing rates of suicide in the military indicate current assessment approaches are not yielding accurate determinations of risk. Concern that endorsement of suicidal ideation may result in obstacles to career advancement may be resulting in nondisclosure. Method: To test this, we recruited a sample of US National Guard personnel (n = 789; 81.7% male; 63.2% white) and administered two measures of current thoughts of suicide. One measure was integrated into our risk assessment protocol and soldiers were thus aware that answers could result in referral to on site military mental health professionals. The other measure was not integrated into the risk assessment protocol and soldiers were thus aware that results would not be reported to on site military mental health professionals. Results: As hypothesized, a higher proportion of individuals reported current thoughts of suicide on the measure not integrated into the risk protocol (9.4%) than on the measure that was (6.0%). Also as hypothesized, a higher proportion of those willing to endorse current thoughts of suicide on the measure not integrated into the risk protocol denied current thoughts of suicide on the one that was (61.5%) than vice versa (39.0%). Limitations include cross-sectional self-report data and a lack of counter-balancing of measures. Conclusions: The results indicate that increasing the confidentiality of risk assessments within the National Guard increases the likelihood of reporting of current thoughts of suicide.

AB Context: The relative importance of illness (physical and mental) and social disadvantage as risk factors for suicide is controversial.
   Objectives: To describe the risk for attempted suicide in women when it is associated with social disadvantage and physical and mental illness.
   Methods: Data were analysed from a population-based cohort study of women aged 18-50, in Goa, India (n = 2494). Baseline information was collected on socioeconomic factors, gender disadvantage and physical and mental illness. The main outcome was self-report attempted suicide (AS) over a 12-month study period. ORs were calculated using exact logistic regression.
   Results: One-year incidence of AS was 0.8% (n = 18+1 completed suicide) and seven of these women had baseline common mental disorders (CMDs) (37%). In unadjusted models, CMDs (OR 8.71, 95% CI 2.86 to 24.43), exposure to violence (OR 7.70, 95% CI 2.80 to 22.21) and recent hunger (OR 6.59, 95% CI 1.83 to 19.77) were the strongest predictors of incident AS cases. However, in a multivariate model, exposure to violence (OR 5.18, 95% CI 1.55 to 18.75) and physical illness (OR 3.77, 95% CI 1.05 to 12.37) emerged as independent predictors of AS.
   Conclusions: Multi-pronged strategies to reduce domestic violence, provide poverty relief and improve treatment of mental and physical disorders are needed to reduce the population burden of attempted suicide.

AB Objective: Provide nationally representative data on the prevalence and psychiatric correlates of suicidal ideation and attempts among African American and Caribbean black adolescents in the United States. Method: Data on nonfatal suicidal behavior among 1,170 African American and Caribbean black adolescents aged 13 to 17 years are from the National Survey of American Life-Adolescent, a nationally representative household survey of adults with an attached adolescent sample conducted between February 2001 and June 2003. Results: Nationwide black adolescents reported having a lifetime prevalence of 7.5% for suicidal ideation and 2.7% for attempts. The 12-month prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempt was 3.2% and 1.4%, respectively. Among all respondents, 4% of black American adolescents and 7% of female subjects were projected to attempt suicide by age 17 years. African American adolescents were approximately five times more likely than Caribbean black adolescents to attempt suicide. Almost half of the National Survey of American Life-Adolescent respondents who reported a suicide attempt had never met criteria for any of the DSM-IV disorders by the time of their attempts. Conclusions: Clinicians should be trained to screen for suicidal behavior, even among those without DSM-IV disorders, when treating black adolescents, particularly female subjects. In addition, preventive efforts should consider ethnic differences in suicide risk and targeting nonclinical settings. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 2009;48(3):271-282.

AB Background: Drug overdose mortality is a major public health concern in the United States, with prescription opioids contributing substantially to recent increases in drug overdose deaths. Compared to unintentional drug overdose deaths, relatively little data describes intentional self-inflicted drug overdose deaths (i.e., suicide by drug overdose). The aim of this study was to examine the characteristics of self-inflicted drug overdose deaths, overall and in comparison to unintentional drug overdose deaths.
   Methods: We linked vital statistics, prescription drug monitoring program, and toxicology data for self-inflicted and unintentional drug overdose deaths among North Carolina residents in 2012.
   Results: Most self-inflicted (79.2%) and unintentional (75.6%) drug overdose decedents had a prescription for a controlled substance within one year of death. Toxicology results revealed that antidepressants contributed to a significantly higher percent of self-inflicted compared to unintentional drug overdose deaths (45.0% vs. 8.1%). Among deaths in which commonly prescribed opioids (oxycodone, hydrocodone) or benzodiazepines (alprazolam, clonazepam) contributed to death, a significantly higher percent of self-inflicted drug overdose decedents had a prescription for the substance within 30 days of death compared to unintentional drug overdose decedents.
   Conclusions: The results highlight the use of prescription opioids, benzodiazepines, and antidepressants among self-inflicted drug overdose decedents. Importantly, the results indicate that self-inflicted drug overdose decedents were more likely than unintentional drug overdose decedents to have potential contact with the health care system in the weeks preceding death, offering an opportunity for professionals to identify and intervene on risk factors or signs of distress and potential for self-harm.

TI Self Inflicted Injuries among Children in United States - Estimates from
   a Nationwide Emergency Department Sample
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID DISORDER; SUICIDE
AB Objective: The objectives of the current study are to provide nationally representative estimates of hospital based emergency department visits (ED) attributed to self inflicted injuries and attempted suicides among children in United States; and to identify potential methods of such intentional self inflicted injuries and attempted suicides.
   Methods: The Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (year 2007) was used. All ED visits occurring among children (aged <= 18 years) with an External Cause of Injury for any of self inflicted injuries were selected. Outcomes examined include hospital ED charges and hospitalization charges. All estimates were projected to national levels.
   Results: 77,420 visits to hospital based emergency departments were attributed to self inflicted injuries among children (26,045 males and 51,370 females). The average age of the ED visits was 15.7 years. 134 patients died in ED's (106 males and 28 females) and 93 died in hospitals following in-patient admission (75 males and 18 females). A greater proportion of male ED visits were discharged routinely as opposed to female ED visits (51.1% versus 44%). A greater proportion of male ED visits also died in the emergency departments compared to female visits (0.4% versus 0.05%). 17,965 ED visits necessitated admission into same hospital. The mean charge for each ED visit was $1,874. Self inflicted injuries by poisoning were the most frequently reported sources accounting for close to 70% of all ED visits.
   Conclusions: Females comprise a greater proportion of ED visits attributed to self inflicted injuries. 227 children died either in the ED's or in hospitals. The current study results highlight the burden associated with such injuries among children.

   SCHEDULE; RISK; CARE; UNEMPLOYMENT; ASSOCIATION; PREVENTION; DISORDERS
AB Background In many countries, psychiatric services have been reformed by reducing the size of hospitals and developing community mental-health services. We investigated this reform by assessing the relation between suicide risk and different ways of organising rnental-health services.
   Methods We did a nationwide comprehensive survey of Finnish adult mental-health service units between Sept 1, 2004, and March 31, 2005. From health-care or social-care officers of 428 municipalities, we asked for information, classified according to the European service mapping schedule, about adult mental-health services. For each municipality, we measured age-adjusted and sex-adjusted suicide risk, pooled between 2000 and 2004, and then adjusted for register-derived socioeconomic factors.
   Findings A wide variety of outpatient services (relative risk [RR] 0 . 92, 95% CI 0.- 87-0.96), prominence of outpatient versus inpatient services (0 . 93, 0.89-0.97), and 24-h emergency services (0 . 84, 0.75-0.92) were associated with decreased death rates from suicide. However, after adjustment for socioeconomic factors, only the prominence of outpatient services was associated with low suicide rate (0.94, 0.90-0.98). We replicated this finding even after adjustment for organisational changes and inpatient treatment.
   Interpretation Well-developed community mental-health services are associated with lower suicide rates than are services oriented towards inpatient treatment provision. These data are consistent with the idea that population mental health can be improved by use of multifaceted, community-based, specialised mental-health services.

AB Introduction: Previous studies using administrative data have demonstrated that the United States opioid epidemic is harming both adults and children, and is straining health care systems. Our objective is to describe the outcomes and trends in resource use among children with acute opioid ingestions using patient-level case report data. Materials and Methods: This study was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from the 55 poison control centers in the United States which comprise the National Poison Data System (NPDS). Children under 19 years of age with a primary opioid ingestion between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2018 were included in the analysis. Trends over three eras (2005-2009, 2010-2014, 2015-2018) were assessed using a Cochran-Armitage Trend Test. Yearly trends in the proportion of cases were calculated using generalized linear models. Multi-variable logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the adjusted odds of variables associated with having at least one Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) level intervention. Results: Children were involved in 207,543 (27.54%) of a total of 1,002,947 primary exposure-related opioid poisoning cases reported to US poison centers. The percentage of patients admitted to a critical care unit from these exposures increased in each era (6.6%, 8.5%, 9.6%). Suicidal intent increased in each era (14.0%, 15.3%, 21.2%), and was associated with increased adjusted odds of receiving a PICU procedure (OR 9.68, CI 7.97-11.76). Fentanyl (OR 12, CI 9.2-15.7), heroin (OR 11.1, CI 9.4-13.1), and methadone (OR 15, CI 13-17.3) were the opioids most associated with having a PICU procedure. Discussion and Conclusions: The severity of admissions for acute opioid ingestions, especially following attempted suicide, has increased over the studied time frame. Efforts focused on reducing access, especially to synthetic and illicit opioids, and addressing adolescent suicidality are needed to reduce these serious consequences of the opioid epidemic on children in the United States.

AB Purpose: To identify geographic and individual-level factors associated with healthcare access among transgender people in the United States.
   Methods: Multilevel analyses were conducted to investigate lifetime healthcare refusal using national data from 5831 U.S. transgender adults. Hierarchical generalized linear models examined associations between individual (age, gender, race, income, insurance, and healthcare avoidance) and state-level factors (percent voting Republican, percent same-sex couple households, income inequality, and transgender protective laws) and lifetime refusal of care.
   Results: Results show that individual-level factors (being older; trans feminine; Native American, multiracial, or other racial/ethnic minority; having low income; and avoiding care due to discrimination) are positively associated with care refusal (all P-values < 0.05). Adjusting for individual-level factors, variation was observed across U.S. states, with a greater proportion of states in the Southern and Western United States with transgender residents at increased odds of experiencing care refusal, relative to other regions of the United States. When adjusting for state-level factors, the percentage of the state population voting Republican was positively associated with care refusal among the transgender adults sampled (P < 0.01).
   Conclusion: Transgender adults surveyed reported differential access to healthcare by geographic region. Identifying geographic and individual-level factors associated with healthcare barriers allows for the development of targeted educational and policy interventions to improve healthcare access for transgender people most in need of services.

AB Do institutions of citizenship shape public opinion among Muslims in the West? Pitched debates about the future of multiculturalism give strong theoretical reason to think that institutions would cause cross-national variation in minority opinion. Institutions set rules for national integration and communal recognition and send signals regarding social views of diversity. Testing these theorised links, however, requires two steps. First, careful conceptualisation of citizenship, both in individual and communal dimensions, categorises states' citizenship regimes. Second, unique cross-national polling of Muslim minorities in France, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States permits analysis of the relationship between institutions and minority political attitudes. Findings demonstrate strong institutional effects on attitudes. However, these effects vary depending on the question asked. Institutions impact on cross-national variation in opinion regarding national identification and women's place in society. There is no evidence of institutional roots of support for suicide terrorism.

AB The problem of Kashmir continues to be the most important dispute between India and Pakistan. These two nuclear states are responsible for a situation that has been ongoing for 70 years: hundreds of people lose their lives every year, suicide attacks frequently occur, state forces apply disproportionate interventions, and the community is oppressed. The UN Security Council, which is primarily responsible for protecting international peace and security, adopted Resolution (47) during its first years of existence. This resolution provides detailed content for direct resolution of the Kashmir problem. For example, the resolution includes the plan for Kashmir to first be cleared of the military, and then the final situation of Jammu-Kashmir should be determined on the basis of the plebiscite application under UN supervision. Unfortunately, despite the plan, the resolution was not implemented due to disruptions in the UN system.

TI Ready to die: a postmodern interpretation of the increase of
   African-American adolescent male suicide

AB African-Americans have typically registered lower rates of suicide than other ethnic groups. In the last 20 years this pattern has changed, particularly among young African-Americans between the ages of 15 and 19 (National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Mortality Statistics, 1998, Atlanta, GA). Today, young African-American males are as likely to commit suicide as their White counterparts. To date, the research conducted regarding this phenomenon has been inconclusive and existing suicide interventions appear to have no effect on reducing this behavior among young African-Americans. This paper synthesizes classical (Durkheim, Suicide, 1979, Free Press, New York) and postmodern (Beck, Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity, 1992, Sage, London; Bauman; Modernity and Ambivalence, Cornell University Press, Ithaca, 1991) social theories in order to provide a more complete theoretical explanation for the increase in the suicide rate among adolescent African-American males. Postmodern society is typified by: (1) institutional deconstruction; (2) decreased collectivism; (3) increased normlessness and helplessness; and (4) exacerbated personal risk for stress. It is therefore possible to hypothesize that postmodernity characteristically loosens the bonds between the individual and society, thereby increasing vulnerability to depression, related pathologies (such as substance abuse), and suicide. African-Americans tend to be more affected/vulnerable because they are concentrated in resource-poor, low income areas, and institutions that provided social support (family, religious, community) and protected individuals from societal risk factors, have gradually been dissolving in postmodern societies. We argue that young African-American males of today are more exposed. to stressors which increase psychological distress thus increasing depression and related pathological behaviors such as suicide. The main reason behind this increase is found in the inability of institutions to offer protection from psychological distress. Overall, this paper presents a postmodern, macro-level framework to explain the increase in suicide among African-American male adolescents. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

   States
ID UNITED-STATES
AB The current study is an original investigation of the U.S. mortality pattern from 2000 to 2017. Previous research has shown that the unusual post-2014 decline in life expectancy is related to the increase in death rates for ages 25-44, mostly due to rising prevalence in drug poisoning and suicide deaths. Our investigation reveals that such increase in younger-age mortality has had an impact not only on life expectancy (or mean age at death), but also, and to a larger extent, on lifespan variability (the dispersion around the mean age at death). Even though lifespan variability is a key component of mortality change, as well as a measure of human well-being, with social, economic, and psychological implications, it has received much less attention than life expectancy has.

AB This article provides the first national estimates of the prevalence and correlates of nonfatal suicidal behavior among older Black Americans. There is a lack of national data on suicide ideation and attempts across ethnic classifications of Blacks in a nationally representative sample. Data are a subsample from the National Survey of American Life (NSAL), a national U.S. adult household probability sample of 5,191 Black Americans. The WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) was used to assess older Blacks for nonfatal suicidal behavior and 14 DSM-IV disorders. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were employed to delineate patterns and correlates of nonfatal suicidal behavior. The estimated lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts among older Blacks in the United States was 6.1% and 2.1%, respectively. On an average it took 2.5 and 5.7 years respectively to go from ideation to attempts or from planning to attempts. Surprisingly, among older Black adults, men reported attempting suicide and seriously consider taking their own lives more than women. Older Blacks at higher risk for suicide attempts were middle aged, had poorer health, were anxious, and had multiple DSM-IV disorders. The results also show that approximately 1 in 4 attempters and 2 in 5 ideators have never sought treatment for their emotional or psychological problems. Preventative care, particularly screening in primary care settings, should consider these findings when treating older Black Americans for psychiatric-related risk.

AB Risk and protective factors associated with suicidal ideation among 1,377 Asian American college students across 66 U.S. campuses were examined. The results indicated a variety of factors were associated with morbid thoughts: medication for mental health concerns, gender, GPA, undergraduate status, religious affiliation, living with a family member, living with a partner, and active participation in student organizations. Furthermore, some of these factors were related to serious consideration of suicide: medication for mental health concerns, undergraduate status, living with family, and active participation in student organizations. Among Asian Americans who seriously considered suicide in the past 12 months, recent family, academic, and financial problems were the top three most frequent significant events occurring before the development of suicidal ideation.

TI Attitudes toward physician-assisted suicide among physicians in Vermont
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; EUTHANASIA
AB Background: Legislation on physician-assisted suicide (PAS) is being considered in a number of states since the passage of the Oregon Death With Dignity Act in 1994. Opinion assessment surveys have historically assessed particular subsets of physicians.
   Objective: To determine variables predictive of physicians' opinions on PAS in a rural state, Vermont, USA.
   Design: Cross-sectional mailing survey.
   Participants: 1052 (48% response rate) physicians licensed by the state of Vermont.
   Results: Of the respondents, 38.2% believed PAS should be legalised, 16.0% believed it should be prohibited and 26.0% believed it should not be legislated. 15.7% were undecided. Males were more likely than females to favour legalisation (42% vs 34%). Physicians who did not care for patients through the end of life were significantly more likely to favour legalisation of PAS than physicians who do care for patients with terminal illness (48% vs 33%). 30% of the respondents had experienced a request for assistance with suicide.
   Conclusions: Vermont physicians' opinions on the legalisation of PAS is sharply polarised. Patient autonomy was a factor strongly associated with opinions in favour of legalisation, whereas the sanctity of the doctor patient relationship was strongly associated with opinions in favour of not legislating PAS. Those in favour of making PAS illegal overwhelmingly cited moral and ethical beliefs as factors in their opinion. Although opinions on legalisation appear to be based on firmly held beliefs, approximately half of Vermont physicians who responded to the survey agree that there is a need for more education in palliative care and pain management.

AB Physician-assisted death (PAD) has long been a strongly debated moral and public policy issue in the United States, and an increasing number of jurisdictions have legalized this practice under certain circumstances. In light of changing terminology, laws, public and professional attitudes, and the availability of published data about the practice, we review key concepts and terms in the ongoing PAD debate, moral arguments for and against PAD, the current legal status of PAD in the United States and in other nations, and data on the reported experience with PAD in those U.S. jurisdictions where it is a legal practice. We then identify situations in which emergency physicians (EPs) may encounter patients who request PAD or have attempted to end their lives with physician assistance and consider EP responses in those situations. Based on our analysis, we offer recommendations for emergency medical practice and professional association policy.

AB The article examines the impact of New Deal relief programs on infant mortality, non-infant mortality, and general fertility rates in major U.S. cities between 1929 and 1940. Effects are estimated using a variety of specifications and techniques for a panel of 114 cities that reported information on relief spending between 1929 and 1940. The significant rise in relief spending during the New Deal contributed to reductions in infant mortality, suicide rates, and some other causes of death, while contributing to increases in the general fertility rate. Similar to Ruhm's (2000) findings for the modem United States, the article finds that many types of death rates were pro-cyclical during the 1930s. Estimates of the relief costs associated with saving a life (adjusted for inflation) are similar to those found in studies of modern social insurance programs.

AB In the popular discourse, it is commonly assumed that mass murderers and mass shooters are different from most criminals in the United States, because they are almost always white. The present study uses data on 308 mass murderers who attacked from 2006 to 2014 to evaluate this assumption, test for racial differences between mass murderers and all other murderers, and identify characteristics of mass murderers' behavior by race and ethnic group. Findings suggest that, overall, the racial composition of mass murderers is similar to that of other murderers, and thus may be largely explained by similar social forces, such as structural disadvantages and social inequalities. However, there are significant differences across racial and ethnic groups in attack subtype, victims killed, and attack resolution. In particular, the structural advantages and aggrieved entitlement experienced by whites may help explain their involvement in public mass shootings. Further research in both the United States and other countries may shed additional light on the behavior of mass murderers and the broader social forces that shape them.

AB Almost all of the available evidence suggests a sharp rise in anxiety, depression, and mental health issues among Western youth between the early 20th century and the early 1990s. Between the early 1990s and the present, more serious problems such as suicide and depression have receded in some data sets, whereas feeling overwhelmed and reporting psychosomatic complaints have continued to increase. Other indicators, such as anxiety, have remained at historically high levels but not continued to increase. This mixed pattern of results may be rooted in the increasing use of antidepressants and therapy and the improvement in some cultural indicators. However, the incidence of youth mental health problems remains unacceptably high.

AB Depression, which affects approximately 6 million men in the United States, is associated with a high risk of mortality from comorbid medical illnesses and from suicide. Evidence suggests that depression affects men differently than women, and that older men in particular may experience special influences, symptoms, and consequences. The causes of late life depression can be divided into psychological, social, and biological factors. Special considerations for this population include laboratory studies to identify possible secondary medical abnormalities that may either accompany or derive from the depressed mood, and pharmacologic treatments that have been shown to be more efficacious in aging men. Research involving depressed hypogonadal and eugonadal men suggests that depressed men may benefit from testosterone augmentation.

ID RISK-FACTORS; PRISONERS; PREVENTION; BEHAVIOR; INMATES
AB Suicidal behavior is a significant problem in United States jails. Suicidal ideation (SI) is an established precursor to suicidal behavior in incarcerated populations. No studies to date have examined the prevalence of SI or its correlates in a mixed-gender U.S. jail sample. The purpose of the present study was to document rates of SI in a mixed-gender jail sample and examine socio-demographic and psychiatric correlates. This study of 511 jail inmates found that approximately 16% of participants reported clinically significant SI upon incarceration. White participants, suicide attempters, and those with a psychiatric diagnosis history endorsed greater SI. Reported SI did not differ by sex and was not correlated with age. Clinically, results indicate that screening for SI in jail samples is necessary to identify high-risk individuals for intervention to prevent suicidal behavior.

AB The FBI has reported the number of monthly firearm background checks in every state since November 1998. This article uses data on background checks at the state level to explore the relationship between guns and crime. The background checks capture an individual's intention to purchase a firearm and explain 96% of the variation in gun manufacturing at a national level. Fixed effect negative binomial regressions show a positive, but insignificant, relationship between background checks and violent crimes. Property crimes are negatively related to background checks and statistically significant at the 10% level. The results suggest that gun control policies should be coupled with other initiatives if policy makers intend to reduce gun-related crime.

TI Age and Birth Cohort-Adjusted Rates of Suicide Mortality Among US Male
   and Female Youths Aged 10 to 19 Years From 1999 to 2017
SO JAMA NETWORK OPEN
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; TRENDS; RISK
AB IMPORTANCE Strategic planning to curb increasing suicide rate among US youths requires unbiased measures of suicide mortality, as the unadjusted suicide mortality rates conventionally used in describing time trends and sex patterns are confounded by the differences in chronological age and year of birth.
   OBJECTIVE To measure time trends and sex differences in suicide mortality among US youths using age and birth cohort (age-cohort)-adjusted rates.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based multiyear cross-sectional study of US youths aged 10 to 19 years was a secondary analysis of the suicide data for January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2017, derived from the Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research, a database prepared by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote research. Data analysis was conducted from May 24 to May 27, 2019.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Age-cohort-adjusted suicide mortality rates by year and sex were used as the main outcomes. These adjusted rates were calculated based on the period effect estimated with the age-period-cohort (APC) modeling method. Participants' age, year of birth, and the year when suicide occurred were used as time-related risk factors.
   RESULTS Age-cohort-adjusted suicide mortality rates were estimated successfully by year and by sex. The adjusted rates were obtained after controlling for a V-shaped cohort effect and a curved age effect that also differed by sex. The unadjusted suicide mortality rate for male youths increased from 7.4 per 100 000 in 1999 to 10.7 per 100 000 in 2017, while the adjusted rate increased from 4.9 per 100 000 in 1999 to 8.7 per 100 000 in 2017. The unadjusted suicide mortality rates for female youths were 1.6 per 100 000 in 1999 and 3.5 per 100 000 in 2017, while the adjusted rates were 1.7 per 100 000 in 1999 and 4.2 per 100 000 in 2017.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Findings of this study indicate a more rapid increase and smaller male-female difference in suicide rates among US youths since 1999 than those shown by the unadjusted suicide mortality rates. The adjusted rates provide unbiased data that are needed for evidence-based decision-making and strategies to curb the increasing suicide rates among US youths.

AB BACKGROUND: Medical students and physicians in training and in practice are at risk for excessive alcohol use and abuse, potentially impacting the affected individuals as well as their family members, trainees, and patients. However, several roadblocks to care, including stigma, often keep them from seeking treatment.
   METHODS: We analyzed data from anonymous questionnaires completed by medical students, house staff, and faculty from 2009 to 2014 as part of a depression awareness and suicide prevention program at a state-supported medical school in the United States. The authors explored associations between self-reported "drinking too much" and depression, suicidal ideation, substance use, intense affective states, and mental health treatment.
   RESULTS: Approximately one-fifth of the respondents reported "drinking too much!' "Drinking too much" was associated with more severe depression and impairment, past suicide attempts and current suicidal ideation, intense affective states, and other substance use. Those who were "drinking too much" were more likely than others to accept referrals for mental health treatment through the anonymous interactive screening program, suggesting that this program may be effective in skirting the stigma barrier for accessing mental health care for this at-risk population.
   CONCLUSIONS: The self-reported prevalence of "drinking too much" among medical students, house staff, and faculty is high and associated with negative mental health outcomes. Targeted, anonymous screenings may identify at-risk individuals and provide mental health care referrals to those in need.

ID PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS; MAJOR DEPRESSION; PREMIGRATION; COMMUNITY
AB We report the case of a young male refugee from Afghanistan who presented after a violent suicide attempt, likely precipitated in part by discrimination and social isolation experienced after immigrating to the United States. Common psychiatric comorbidities associated with immigration from war-torn nations are reviewed with a particular emphasis on how adequate screening and additional resources for vulnerable refugees during and after immigration continues to be an unmet need. Our findings suggest that there is a critical need and additional studies should be conducted, not only to identify at risk refugee populations but also to prevent potentially violent behavior. Our findings also suggest a lack of an optimal screening tool and shed light on the struggles of refugees, particularly those from Afghanistan.

We focus on three cohort factors: family structure, school enrollment and the sex ratio. For both blacks and whites, cohorts with less traditional family structures have higher NFRs. Other results differ by race. The impact of school enrollment on NFRs is significantly negative for whites, but significantly positive for blacks. The impact of sex ratio is significantly negative for blacks, but insignificant for whites. If black women and white women had cohort characteristics typical of the other group, age specific NFRs for black women would decline markedly, while those for whites would increase markedly.

AB The ethical underpinnings of palliative care and those of voluntary euthanasia and assisted suicide ( VE/AS) are often viewed as opposites. In this article, we review the values held in common by the euthanasia legalization movement and palliative care providers. Outlining this common ground serves to define, with greater clarity, the issues on which differences do exist, and ways in which some open questions, which are as yet unresolved, could be approached. Open discussion between VE/AS legalization advocates and palliative care providers is important to address these open questions seriously, and to enrich the care of terminally ill patients by giving members of both groups access to each other's experience.

AB Background: Suicide is a global public health problem. Recently in the U. S., much attention has been given to preventing suicide and other premature mortality in veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. A strong predictor of suicide is a past suicide attempt, and suicide attempters have multiple physical and mental comorbidities that put them at risk for additional causes of death. We examined mortality among U. S. military veterans after hospitalization for attempted suicide.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted with all military veterans receiving inpatient treatment during 1993-1998 at United States Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facilities following a suicide attempt. Deaths occurring during 1993-2002, the most recent available year at the time, were identified through VA Beneficiary and Records Locator System data and National Death Index data. Mortality data for the general U. S. adult population were also obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics. Comparisons within the veteran cohort, between genders, and against the U. S. population were conducted with descriptive statistics and standardized mortality ratios. The actuarial method was used estimate the proportion of veterans in the cohort we expect would have survived through 2002 had they experienced the same rate of death that occurred over the study period in the U. S. population having the age and sex characteristics.
   Results: During 1993-1998, 10,163 veterans were treated and discharged at a VA medical center after a suicide attempt (mean age = 44 years; 91% male). There was a high prevalence of diagnosed alcohol disorder or abuse (31.8%), drug dependence or abuse (21.8%), psychoses (21.2%), depression (18.5%), and hypertension (14.2%). A total of 1,836 (18.1%) veterans died during follow up (2,941.4/100,000 person years). The cumulative survival probability after 10 years was 78.0% (95% CI = 72.9, 83.1). Hence the 10-year cumulative mortality risk was 22.0%, which was 3.0 times greater than expected. The leading causes overall were heart disease (20.2%), suicide (13.1%), and unintentional injury (12.7%). Whereas suicide was the ninth leading cause of death in the U. S. population overall (1.8%) during the study period, suicide was the leading and second leading cause among women (25.0%) and men (12.7%) in the cohort, respectively.
   Conclusions: Veterans who have attempted suicide face elevated risks of all-cause mortality with suicide being prominent. This represents an important population for prevention activities.

TI Risk of Suicide Following Deliberate Self-poisoning

LA English
DT Article
ID HARM; MORTALITY; COHORT; CARE; ILLNESS; DEATH
AB IMPORTANCE Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, and its rate has risen by 16% in the past decade. Deliberate self-poisoning is the leadingmethod of attempted suicide. Unlike more violent methods, which are almost universally fatal, survival following self-poisoning is common, providing an opportunity for secondary prevention. However, the long-term risk of suicide following a first episode of self-poisoning is unknown.
   OBJECTIVE To determine the risk of suicide and mortality from other causes following a first self-poisoning episode.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Population-based cohort study using multiple linked health care databases. We identified all individuals with a first self-poisoning episode in Ontario, Canada, from April 1, 2002, through December 31, 2010, and followed up all surviving participants until December 31, 2011, or death, whichever occurred first. For each individual with a deliberate self-poisoning episode, we randomly selected 1 control from the same population with no such history, matched for age (within 3 months), sex, and calendar year.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary analysis examined the risk of suicide following discharge after self-poisoning. The secondary analyses explored factors associated with suicide and examined the risk of death caused by accidents or any other cause.
   RESULTS We identified 65 784 patients (18 482 [28.1%] younger than 20 years) who were discharged after a first self-poisoning episode. During a median follow-up of 5.3 years (interquartile range, 3.1-7.6 years), 4176 died, including 976 (23.4%) by suicide. The risk of suicide following self-poisoning was markedly increased relative to controls (hazard ratio, 41.96; 95% CI, 27.75-63.44), corresponding to a suicide rate of 278 vs 7 per 100 000 person-years, respectively. The median time from hospital discharge to completed suicide was 585 days (interquartile range, 147-1301 days). Older age, male sex, multiple intervening self-poisoning episodes, higher socioeconomic status, depression, and recent psychiatric care were strongly associated with suicide. Patients with a self-poisoning episode were also more likely to die because of accidents (hazard ratio, 10.45; 95% CI, 8.10-13.47) and all causes combined (hazard ratio, 5.55; 95% CI, 5.12-6.02).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A first self-poisoning episode is a strong predictor of subsequent suicide and premature death. Most suicides occur long after the index poisoning, emphasizing the importance of longitudinal, sustained secondary prevention initiatives.

   FEATURES
AB In the United States, there is a paucity of studies examining sharp force injuries (SFIs), defined as an injury inflicted by cutting or stabbing with a sharp instrument. Few studies exist that discriminate between the injury patterns of suicidal or homicidal deaths incurred by SFI. In this retrospective study, all deaths secondary to SFI were evaluated at the Bexar County Medical Examiner's Office from January 1988 through May 2010. Exclusion criteria were deaths occurring more than 24 hours after injury and wounds obscured by healing or extensive medical intervention. The following data were analyzed: age of decedent, sex, wound location, number of wounds, type of SFI (stab vs incised), visceral organ or vascular injury, concomitant injuries, and manner of death. Defensive injuries in homicides and hesitation marks in suicides were also recorded. A total of 418 deaths met inclusion criteria: 349 homicides, 54 suicides, 12 accidents, and 2 where the manner of death could not be determined.
   The average age of homicide victims was 35 years, whereas that of suicide victims was 47 years. Gender was not significantly different between the homicide and suicide groups. Homicide victims incurred a greater number of wounds per case compared with suicides, 5.3 versus 4.1, respectively, and had a greater number of stab wounds, 3.3 per case compared with 0.7 per case, respectively. Incisional wounds were statistically greater in suicides, with an average number of 3.3 per case compared with 2.1 in homicides.
   Injuries to the head, chest, and back were more common in homicides when compared with suicides, whereas injuries to the abdomen and extremities were more frequent in suicides. Comparison of major visceral and vascular damage between homicides and suicides revealed statistically greater injury to the heart, lungs, and thoracic vessels in homicides, but there was a greater frequency of injury to the vasculature of the extremities in suicides. The presence of additional (non-SFI) injuries was more common in homicides than in suicides. Hesitation marks/tentative wounds occurred in 35% of suicides, whereas defensive injuries occurred in 31% of homicides. This epidemiological study can assist the forensic pathologist in determining the most probable manner of death from SFI but does not substitute for a thorough examination of the circumstances of death and a meticulous autopsy.

AB Various family factors are risk factors for adolescent suicidality (suicidal ideation and suicide attempts). However, little is known about the role of parenting in adolescent suicidality. The present study examined the unique relations between three parenting dimensions (parental warmth, behavioral control, and psychological control) and adolescent suicidality, as well as the mediating role of adolescent hopelessness among these relations. A total of 1529 Chinese adolescents (52 % male; mean age = 14.74 years, SD = 1.48) completed anonymous questionnaires designed to assess three parenting dimensions, hopelessness, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. After controlling for gender, age, family structure, and socioeconomic status, it was found that parental warmth negatively predicted adolescent suicidality, whereas psychological control positively predicted adolescent suicidality. In addition, parental warmth negatively predicted adolescent hopelessness, whereas psychological control positively predicated adolescent hopelessness, which in turn enhanced adolescent suicidality. Although behavioral control did not predict adolescent suicidality, it did negatively predict adolescent hopelessness, which in turn promoted adolescent suicidality. These findings revealed the differential roles of different parenting dimensions in adolescent suicidality, and the mediation effect of adolescent hopelessness between parenting and adolescent suicidality. Future practices would benefit from incorporating both parenting and hopelessness for optimal intervention effect.

AB Background: Suicide rates are elevated in the veterinary profession in several countries, yet little is known about possible contributory and preventive factors. Aims: To obtain information from veterinarians with a history of suicidal ideation or behavior about the factors associated with suicidality in their profession. Methods: We conducted a mixed-methods interview study with 21 UK veterinarians who had attempted suicide or reported recent suicidal ideation. Interview topics included work and nonwork contributory factors, coping mechanisms, and preventive factors. Results: Self-poisoning was the most common method used or considered by participants. Common contributory factors were workplace relationships, career concerns, patient issues, number of hours and volume of work, and responsibility, although two-thirds of participants reported co-occurring difficult life events. Around half had received a psychiatric diagnosis following their suicidal behavior. Several possible preventive measures were suggested by participants. Conclusions: Several work-and non-work-related contributory factors to suicidality in the veterinary profession were identified. Future preventive measures may involve better promotion of support services, formal support for recent graduates, and improving employers' attitudes toward work-life balance.

AB We systematically quantified excess mortality in epilepsy patients by cause of death using the population-attributable fraction and epilepsy-attributable years of potential life lost (YPLL) by age 75 years at ages 15 and over. We updated and undertook a re-review of mortality studies from our previous systematic review following PRISMA guidelines to identify cohort studies of general epilepsy populations reporting a relative risk (RR) of death by cause relative to the background rates in the population. Studies on epilepsy prevalence were identified through published reviews. Country-specific mortality figures were obtained from the WHO World Mortality Database. We performed a pooled analysis with the DerSimonian-Laird random effects method. In countries with very high Human Development Indices, epilepsy contributed to 0.5-1.1 % of all deaths in the total population. Among external causes, suicides (RR 2.9, 95 % confidence interval 2.2-3.8; I-2 52 %) were the major contributor to YPLL, corresponding to 6.7 % and 4.2 % of excess YPLL due to epilepsy in the United States (US) and in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2010, with 541 (346-792) and 44 (28-65) excess suicide cases, respectively. Fatal accidental falls were more common, with 813 (610-1064) and 95 (71-125) excess deaths in the US and in the UK, but these caused only 2.0 % of excess YPLL as they occurred in older age groups. Suicides were the most important external cause of death in epilepsy patients in terms of excess YPLL, whereas other external causes were either more common in older ages or caused less excess deaths.

AB Asian Indians represent a significant portion of the largest growing race of Asians in the past decade in the United States. This selective review examines major cultural themes related to first-and second-generation Asian Indians living in the United States as they impact psychological and psychiatric dysfunction in this population. Specifically, we review the impact of Asian Indian culture on mental health, discuss the impact of acculturation and ethnic identity development on the mental health of Indian-Americans, and focus on typical mental health problems of Asian Indian adolescents, women and elderly in America. Finally, we provide a brief overview of empirically-supported treatment approaches and cultural considerations for additional treatments relevant to this population.

AB Background: In pediatric emergency departments (EDs), adolescents at risk for suicide often escape detection and successful referral for outpatient mental health care.
   Objective: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a brief, ED-based mental health service engagement intervention to increase linkage to outpatient mental health services.
   Design/Methods: Adolescents presenting to a pediatric ED who were not currently receiving mental health services were screened for suicide-related risk factors (Columbia Suicide Scale). If positive, youths were then screened for impairment, alcohol use, and depression. Those screening positive on the Columbia Suicide Scale and the alcohol, impairment, or depression screen were randomly assigned to the intervention (short motivational interview, barrier reduction, outpatient appointment established, reminders before scheduled appointment) or standard referral (telephone number for a mental health provider). Study groups were compared with respect to screen acceptability and outpatient mental health care linkage and change in depression symptoms at 60 days after the index ED visit.
   Results: A total of 204 families were enrolled. Overall, 24 adolescents (12%) screened positive for suicide risk factors and were randomized to the intervention (n = 11) or standard referral (n = 13) groups. The groups did not significantly differ on several measures of screen acceptability. As compared with the standard referral group (15.4%), the intervention group (63.6%) was significantly more likely to attend a mental health appointment during the follow-up period (Fisher exact test, P = 0.03). There was also a nonsignificant trend toward greater improvement of depressive symptoms in the intervention than standard referral group (t = 1.79, df = 18, P = 0.09).
   Conclusions: When adolescents are identified in the ED with previously unrecognized mental health problems that increase suicide risk, a brief motivational and barrier-reducing intervention improves linkage to outpatient mental health services.

AB Suicide rates doubled in males aged < 45 in England and Wales between 1950 and 1998, in contrast rates declined in older males and females of all ages. Explanations for these divergent trends are largely speculative, but social changes are likely to have played an important role. We undertook a time-series analysis using routinely available age- and sex-specific suicide, social, economic and health data, focussing on the two age groups in which trends have diverged most-25-34 and 60 + year olds. Between 1950 and 1998 there were unfavourable trends in many of the risk factors for suicide: rises in divorce, unemployment and substance misuse and declines in births and marriage. Whilst economic prosperity has increased, so too has income inequality. Trends in suicide risk factors were generally similar in both age-sex groups, although the rises in divorce and markers of substance misuse were most marked in 25-34 year olds and young males experienced the lowest rise in antidepressant prescribing. Statistical modelling indicates that no single factor can be identified as underlying recent trends. The factors most consistently associated with the rises in young male suicide are increases in divorce, declines in marriage and increases in income inequality. These changes have had little effect on suicide in young females. This may be because the drugs commonly used in overdose-their favoured method of suicide-have become less toxic or because they are less affected by the factors underlying the rise in male suicide. In older people declines in suicide were associated with increases in gross domestic product, the size of the female workforce, marriage and the prescribing of antidepressants. Recent population trends in suicide appear to be associated with by a range of social and health related factors. It is possible that some of the patterns observed are due to declining levels of social integration, but such effects do not appear to have adversely influenced patterns in older generations.

AB IMPORTANCE Suicide represents the 10th leading cause of death across age groups in the United States (12.6 cases per 100 000) and remains challenging to predict. While many individuals who die by suicide are seen by physicians before their attempt, they may not seek psychiatric care.
   OBJECTIVE To determine the extent to which incorporating natural language processing of narrative discharge notes improves stratification of risk for death by suicide after medical or surgical hospital discharge.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this retrospective health care use study, clinical data were analyzed from individuals with discharges from 2 large academic medical centers between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2013.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was suicide as a reported cause of death based on Massachusetts Department of Public Health records. Regression models for prediction of death by suicide or accidental death were compared relying solely on coded clinical data and those using natural language processing of hospital discharge notes.
   RESULTS There were 845 417 hospital discharges represented in the cohort, including 458 053 unique individuals. Overall, all-cause mortality was 18% during 9 years, and the median follow-up was 5.2 years. The cohort included 235 (0.1%) who died by suicide during 2.4 million patient-years of follow-up. Positive valence reflected in narrative notes was associated with a 30% reduction in risk for suicide in models adjusted for coded sociodemographic and clinical features (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.58-0.85; P < .001) and improved model fit (chi(2)(2) = 14.843, P < .001 by log-likelihood test). The C statistic was 0.741 (95% CI, 0.738-0.744) for models of suicide with or without inclusion of accidental death.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Multiple clinical features available at hospital discharge identified a cohort of individuals at substantially increased risk for suicide. Greater positive valence expressed in narrative discharge summaries was associated with substantially diminished risk. Automated tools to aid clinicians in evaluating these risks may assist in identifying high-risk individuals.

AB Death resulting from plastic bag asphyxia has been recognized for >40 years, but relatively little is known about either its epidemiology or its pathophysiology. Over 15 years (1984-1998), 30 deaths were attributed to plastic bag asphyxia among the 14,560 autopsies performed in the Forensic Medicine Unit in Edinburgh. These 30 deaths involved 20 male and 10 female subjects, with an age range of 13 to 81 years. Eleven had some alcohol measurable in the blood, with four having levels >80 mg/dl. Only one individual appeared to have ingested a drug overdose, but inhaled substances within the plastic bag may have contributed to death in five cases. The absence of childhood accidental deaths may reflect successful preventive measures. The 3 accidental deaths involved adults (including 2 who died of autoerotic asphyxia), and the remaining deaths were 27 suicides. Of those who committed suicide, most (59%) had chronic psychiatric illness rather than chronic debilitating or terminal physical illness. In contrast with reports from the United States, publicity associated with "self-deliverance" did not result in an increased number of deaths from plastic bag asphyxia (4 deaths in this series). Analysis of the circumstances of all the deaths revealed them to be difficult to predict and hence prevent.

AB Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of alcohol abuse and/or dependence in a population-based sample of young adults and assess the prevalence of comorbid mood disorders, anxiety, and suicide risk in this population.
   Methods: This cross-sectional, population-based study enrolled 1,953 young adults aged 18-35 years. The CAGE questionnaire was used to screen for alcohol abuse and/or dependence, with CAGE scores >= 2 considered positive. Psychiatric disorders were investigated through the structured Mini International Neuro-psychiatric Interview (MINI).
   Results: Alcohol abuse and/or dependence was identified in 187 (9.60%) individuals (5.10% among women and 15.20% among men). Alcohol abuse and/or dependence were more prevalent among men than women, as well as among those who used tobacco, illicit drugs or presented with anxiety disorder, mood disorder, and suicide risk.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that alcohol abuse and/or dependence are consistently associated with a higher prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities, could be considered important predictors of other psychiatric disorders, and deserve greater public heath attention, pointing to the need for alcohol abuse prevention programs.

AB This case concerns an unusual suicidal plastic bag suffocation. An elderly white man was found dead and partially disrobed in his apartment lying supine on a sofa with a plastic bag closed by a rope over the head and the upper and lower extremities tightly tied with two other ropes, the end of both arranged into slipknots (self-rescue mechanism). Police investigations found no pornography in the apartment, and circumstantial data alleged no psychiatric disorders or suicidal intentions. The autopsy excluded signs of struggle and sexual intercourse as well as any type of injury or physical illness. Chemical analyses on the peripheral blood excluded acute drugs and/or alcohol intoxication. A differential diagnosis of the manner of death was performed, including scenarios of accidental autoerotic asphyxiation, homicide during either sexual activity or ritualistic, elderly suicide. The collected data most strongly supported the hypothesis of a suicidal asphyxiation simulating homicide to devolve a life insurance to the victim's sons because of economic difficulties.

AB Political statements about the relationship between the economy and health intensify during economic downturns and fade in times of prosperity. Population health researchers share this cyclical interest in that the numbers of peer-reviewed publications on this topic increase during and immediately after recessions. In this issue of the Journal, Cylus et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2014;180(1):45-52) follow in the "economy and health" research tradition and examine the relationship between US unemployment rates and suicide mortality. Their work makes a novel contribution in that they examine whether generous unemployment insurance benefits attenuate the relationship between economic downturns and suicide mortality in the United States. In this commentary, I assess the internal validity of their analysis, call into question some assumptions of their approach, and place their contribution within the context of the broader literature. I then argue that population-based and individual-based approaches in the "economy and health" field often work in concert to create knowledge and inform policy-makers.

TI The Question of the Constitutional Case Against Suicide: An

   Theory of the Inalienable Right to Life and Liberty Is Enforced by the
   Thirteenth Amendment
SO ISSUES IN LAW & MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID HISTORY LITE; SLAVERY
AB This article completes a study that the author foreshadowed in his previous articles. The Western moral theory that defends the inalienable right to life and liberty and that therefore forbids all forms of suicide and slavery is now well known to the author's readers. What is not well known is an answer to the question of whether this theory, in its totality, was part of the original intent of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The theory of the inalienable right to life and liberty was supported by many political philosophers in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Those philosophers and their theory did shape a good deal of the thought of the men who made the Thirteenth Amendment a part of the Constitution. The anti-suicide implication of the theory, however, was not present in the minds of the framers and ratifiers of the Thirteenth Amendment, and therefore was not part of their intent.

ID JUVENILE; FACILITIES; DISORDERS; DETENTION
AB Across the United States, the availability of mental health, substance abuse, and recidivism reduction programs in the juvenile justice system (JJS) varies from none or few to a rich variety of programs. Within the last decade, prison privatization in the adult correctional system has influenced the onset of privatization in the JJS. The differences between public and private sectors in their availability of mental health services and treatment programs to juvenile offenders are understudied. In this article, a secondary analysis of a national census of 3163 juvenile facilities was conducted to determine differences in treatment availability as well as the impact of treatment accessibility on the event of a suicide. Results indicate private facilities more likely to offer treatment services and schedule mental health personnel more frequently. Those facilities reporting family counseling treatment programs were less likely to have reported a suicide event. Policy implications and a review of progress towards improvement in the AS are presented. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background. Clinical judgments about the likelihood of suicide attempt Would be aided by an index of risk Factors that could be quickly assessed in diverse settings. We Sought to develop such a risk index for 12-month suicide attempts among suicide ideators.
   Method. The National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), a household survey of adults aged 18 +, assessed the 12-month occurrence Of Suicide ideation, plans and attempts in a subsample of 5692 respondents. Retrospectively assessed correlates include history of prior suicidality, socio-demographics, parental psychopathology and 12-month DSM-IV disorders.
   Results. Twelve-month prevalence estimates of suicide ideation, plans and attempts are 2(.)6, 0(.)7 and 0(.)4 % respectively. Although ideators with a plan are more likely to make an attempt (31(.)9%,,) than those without a plan (9(.)6%), 43% of attempts were described as unplanned. History or prior attempts is the strongest correlate of 12-month attempts. Other significant correlates include shorter duration of ideation, presence of a suicide plan, and several socio-demographic and parental psychopathology variables. Twelve-month disorders are not powerful correlates. A four-category summary index of correlates is strongly related to attempts among ideators [area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC)=0(.)88]. The distribution (conditional probability of attempt) of the risk index is: 19(.)0% very low (0(.)0%), 51(.)1% low (3(.)5 %), 16(.)2 % intermediate (21(.)3 %), and 13(.)7% high (78(.)1 %). Two-thirds (67(.)1 %) of attempts were made by ideators in the high-risk category.
   Conclusions. A short, preliminary risk index based on retrospectively reported responses to fully structured questions is strongly correlated with 12-month suicide attempts among ideators, with a high concentration or attempts among high-risk ideators.

AB Background Working in clinical practice involves exposure to many hazards, resulting in ongoing concerns regarding mortality in doctors when compared with the general public.
   Aims To evaluate the survival data of all Taiwanese doctors and to ascertain whether doctors experience premature mortality.
   Methods Death and census data from 1990 to 2006 were obtained for all practising doctors in Taiwan. Cause-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated via the Life Table Analysis System using the general population of Taiwan as the reference.
   Results All the SMRs of different medical specialties were below 0.34. Doctors in Taiwan were found to be less likely to die from all causes, including suicide and drug abuse. The SMRs for suicide and drug abuse were generally below 0.50 [SMR = 0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09-0.21 and SMR = 0.16, 95% CI 0.07-0.32, respectively].
   Conclusions The risks of all-cause and cause-specific mortality of doctors were found to be lower than those of the general population in Taiwan.

AB Background: Mounting evidence demonstrates the relationship between high temperatures and adverse mental health outcomes. Yet, no study has examined the influence of temperature on crisis support-seeking behavior among youth in large urban areas.
   Methods: Crisis Text Line (CTL) is a text messaging service that provides crisis interventions for support-seeking individuals for a range of mental-health outcomes in the United States. We applied a distributed lag non-linear modeling technique to assess the short-term impacts of daily maximum and minimum temperature on crisis-related events in four metropolitan locations in the USA.
   Results: There were multiple positive associations in three of the four study locations that demonstrate crisis help-seeking behavior increased during anomalously warm conditions.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that there is a significant association between high minimum or maximum temperatures and crisis help-seeking behaviors in young adults and adolescents in urban areas in the United States. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: To examine disparities between sexual minority youth (SMY) and heterosexual youth in rates of suicidality and depression symptoms.
   Methods: Separate meta-analyses were conducted to examine suicidality and depression disparities. Studies were included if the average age of the participants was <8 years, and if suicidality or depression symptoms were compared across SMY and heterosexual youth.
   Results: SMY reported significantly higher rates of suicidality (odds ratio [OR] = 2.92) and depression symptoms (standardized mean difference, d = .33) as compared with the heterosexual youth. Disparities increased with the increase in the severity of suicidality (ideation [OR = 1.96], intent/plans [OR = 2.20], suicide attempts [OR = 3.18], suicide attempts requiring medical attention [OR = 4.17]). Effects did not vary across gender, recruitment source, and sexual orientation definition.
   Conclusions: Disparities in suicidality and depression may be influenced by negative experiences including discrimination and victimization. Clinicians should assess sexual orientation, analyze psychosocial histories to identify associated risk factors, and promote prevention and intervention opportunities for SMY and their families.

AB This study sought to compare risk factors for suicidal ideation among heterosexual and sexual minority college students from a previously understudied conservative region of the United States. Suicidal ideation, thwarted belongingness (TB), perceived burdensomeness (PB), and capability for suicide were examined. It was found that PB was significantly higher among sexual minorities than heterosexual individuals, TB and capability were not significantly different, and suicidal ideation was not significantly different when controlling for depression but was significant when depression was not a covariate. Additionally, among sexual minorities and heterosexuals, TB and PB were correlated with ideation and that the strength of the relationship between PB and ideation was dependent on how much TB the individual is experiencing. Sexual minorities, when compared to heterosexual individuals, do not have higher TB or capability, but do have higher levels of PB and suicidal ideation.

   IDEATION; PREVENTION
AB Purpose: To describe secular trends in suicidal thoughts and attempts and the types of health-risk behaviors associated with suicidal thoughts and attempts among U. S. high school students.
   Methods: Data were analyzed from 11 national Youth Risk Behavior Surveys conducted biennially during 1991-2011. Each survey employed a nationally representative sample of students in grades 9-12 and provided data from approximately 14,000 students. Using sex-stratified logistic regression models that controlled for race/ethnicity and grade, we analyzed secular trends in the prevalence of suicidal thoughts and attempts. Adjusted prevalence ratios (APR) were calculated to measure associations between suicide risk and a broad range of health-risk behaviors.
   Results: During 1991-2011, among female students, both suicidal thoughts (seriously considered suicide; made a plan to attempt suicide) and attempts (any attempt; attempt with injury requiring medical treatment) decreased significantly; among male students, only suicidal thoughts decreased significantly. During 2011, compared with students with no suicidal thoughts or attempts, the health-risk behaviors most strongly associated with suicide attempts among female students were injection drug use (APR=12.8), carrying a weapon on school property (APR=9.7), and methamphetamine use (APR=8.7); among male students, the strongest associations were for IDU (APR=22.4), using vomiting/laxatives for weight control (APR=17.1), and having been forced to have sex (APR=14.8).
   Conclusions: School-based suicide prevention programs should consider confidential screening for health-risk behaviors that are strongly associated with suicide attempts to help identify students at increased risk for suicide and provide referrals to suicide and other prevention services (e. g., substance abuse and violence prevention) as appropriate.

AB There is a lack of empirically supported theories explaining suicidal ideation and few theories describe how suicidal ideation can be prevented in the context of normative human development. Rogers (2001) proposed an existential constructivist theory of suicide (ECTS) wherein existential distress and the inability to reconstruct meaning from adverse life events contribute to suicidal ideation. The ECTS includes a distinct focus on meaning reconstruction from adverse life events, which is congruent with existing research on college students and developmental frameworks used by counseling psychologists. Thus, in the present study, we tested the predictions of the ECTS in a college student sample. We collected data online from 195 college students (i.e., ages 18-25) attending a large, Midwestern university and analyzed the data using structural equation modeling. Findings provided partial support for the original ECTS. Post hoc analyses of an alternate ECTS model indicated that existential distress mediated the negative association between meaning reconstruction and suicidal ideation.

AB IMPORTANCE Suicide is a leading cause of preventable death, especially among individuals with psychotic disorders, and may also be common among nonclinical populations of adults with subthreshold psychotic experiences. Understanding this association has the potential to critically bolster suicide prevention efforts.
   OBJECTIVES To examine the association between 12-month suicidality and 12-month psychotic experiences and to test the hypotheses that psychotic experiences are associated with increased prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts during the concurrent period and with greater severity of suicidal behavior.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional survey datawere drawn from a large general population-based sample of households in the United States identified through the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (2001-2003). Adult household residents (n = 11,716) were selected using a clustered multistage sampling design with oversampling of racial/ethnic minority groups. Logistic regression models were adjusted for potential demographic confounders and co-occurring DSM-IV mental health conditions.
   EXPOSURES Twelve-month psychotic experiences assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, version 3.0 psychosis screen.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Twelve-month suicidal ideation and suicide attempts.
   RESULTS Respondents reporting psychotic experiences were more likely to report concurrent suicidal ideation (odds ratio [OR], 5.24; 95% CI, 2.85-9.62) and suicide attempts (OR, 9.48; 95% CI, 3.98-22.62). Most respondents with psychotic experiences (mean [SE], 65.2% [4.2%]) met criteria for a DSM-IV depressive, anxiety, or substance use disorder. Among respondents with suicidal ideation, those with psychotic experiences were likely to make an attempt during the concurrent 12-month period OR, 3.49; 95% CI, 1.05-11.58) when adjusting for co-occurring psychiatric disorders. In contrast, depressive (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 0.62-4.52), anxiety (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 0.40-6.09), and substance use disorders (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 0.24-11.17) did not reliably identify those at risk for attempts among respondents with suicidal ideation. The mean (SE) 12-month prevalence of suicide attempts among individuals reporting ideation and psychotic experiences and meeting criteria for any psychiatric disorder was 47.4%(10.9%) compared with 18.9%(4.8%) among those with just ideation and a disorder. Psychotic experiences were especially prevalent among individuals reporting severe attempts and may account for nearly one-third of attempts with intent to die (population attributable risk, 29.01%) in the United States annually.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Assessment of psychotic experiences among individuals with suicidal ideation has potential clinical and public health utility in reducing the prevalence of suicide attempts, particularly attempts with intent to die.

AB Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents, many of whom fail to disclose suicide concerns to adults who might help. This study examined patterns and predictors of help-seeking behavior among adolescents who seriously considered suicide in the past year. 2,737 students (50.9 % female, 46.9 % male; racial distribution 79.5 % Caucasian, 11.9 % Hispanic/Latino, and 3.6 % Black/African-American) from 12 high schools in rural/underserviced communities were surveyed to assess serious suicide ideation (SI) in the past year, disclosure of SI to adults and peers, attempts to get help, attitudes about help-seeking, perceptions of school engagement, and coping support. Help-seeking was defined as both disclosing SI to an adult and perceiving oneself as seeking help. The relationship between adolescents' help-seeking disclosure and (1) help-seeking attitudes and (2) perceptions of social resources was examined among suicidal help-seeking youth, suicidal non-help-seeking youth, and non-suicidal youth. Of the 381 (14 %) students reporting SI, only 23 % told an adult, 29 % sought adult help, and 15 % did both. Suicidal help-seekers were similar to non-suicidal peers on all measures of help-seeking attitudes and social environment perceptions. Positive attitudes about help-seeking from adults at school, perceptions that adults would respond to suicide concerns, willingness to overcome peer secrecy requests, and greater coping support and engagement with the school were associated with students' increased disclosure of SI and help-seeking. This study supports prevention strategies that change student norms, attitudes and social environments to promote help-seeking among adolescents with SI. Promising intervention targets include increasing students' perceptions of the availability and capability of adults to help them, and strengthening students' understanding of how existing resources can help them cope.

AB Objective: To examine 1) temporal trends between 2005 and 2014 in the three most frequently used suicide means (firearms, hanging/suffocation, alcohol/drug/medicine overdose) by decedents aged 50+ years and 2) associations of suicide means with sociodemographic and precipitating factors. Methods: The National Violent Death Reporting System, 2005-2014, provided data (N = 46,857). Suicide means were identified from ICD-10 codes for underlying cause of death and coroner/medical examiner (CME) reports. Precipitating factors are based on either CME or law enforcement report. Age-group (50-64 and 65+ years) and gender-separate logistic regression analyses were used to examine study questions. Results: In the 50-64 years age group, each advancing year (i.e., from 2005 to 2014) was associated with a 1% decrease in the odds of firearm use and a 6% increase in the odds of hanging/suffocation among men; a 9% increase in the odds of hanging/suffocation among women; and a 4% decrease in the odds of overdose among each gender. In the 65+ years age group, each advancing year was associated with a 4% increase in the odds of overdose among men. Physical health was a significant factor for firearm use among men (adjusted odds ratio: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.39-1.55) only. Regardless of gender and age, mental health and substance abuse problems and prior suicide attempts were associated with hanging/suffocation and overdose. Conclusions: Firearm use decreased among men aged 50-64 years between 2005 and 2014, but its use did not change among the other gender by age groups. With rapidly growing numbers of older adults, routine suicide risk assessments, firearm safety monitoring, and interventions to improve quality of life are needed.

AB Background. The Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) has found that the proportional elevation in the US Army enlisted soldier suicide rate during deployment (compared with the never-deployed or previously deployed) is significantly higher among women than men, raising the possibility of gender differences in the adverse psychological effects of deployment.
   Method. Person-month survival models based on a consolidated administrative database for active duty enlisted Regular Army soldiers in 2004-2009 (n = 975 057) were used to characterize the gender x deployment interaction predicting suicide. Four explanatory hypotheses were explored involving the proportion of females in each soldier's occupation, the proportion of same-gender soldiers in each soldier's unit, whether the soldier reported sexual assault victimization in the previous 12 months, and the soldier's pre-deployment history of treated mental/behavioral disorders.
   Results. The suicide rate of currently deployed women (14.0/100 000 person-years) was 3.1-3.5 times the rates of other (i.e. never-deployed/previously deployed) women. The suicide rate of currently deployed men (22.6/100 000 personyears) was 0.9-1.2 times the rates of other men. The adjusted (for time trends, sociodemographics, and Army career variables) female: male odds ratio comparing the suicide rates of currently deployed v. other women v. men was 2.8 (95% confidence interval 1.1-6.8), became 2.4 after excluding soldiers with Direct Combat Arms occupations, and remained elevated (in the range 1.9-2.8) after adjusting for the hypothesized explanatory variables.
   Conclusions. These results are valuable in excluding otherwise plausible hypotheses for the elevated suicide rate of deployed women and point to the importance of expanding future research on the psychological challenges of deployment for women.

AB Firearms are a significant risk factor in suicide and older adults are disproportionately impacted in suicide by this means. This study investigated the impact of Counseling on Access to Lethal Means (CALM) training with geriatric case managers at an Area Agency on Aging. A concurrent mixed methods approach was used to explore 1) geriatric case managers' attitudes, beliefs, and behavioral intentions about counseling on access to lethal means following CALM training, and 2) perceived barriers to assessing for suicidality and counseling clients on access to firearms. The CALM evaluation data was collected immediately posttest at CALM training, at three-month follow up. Results indicated that 38% of respondents reported they had, since CALM training, discussed reducing access to lethal means with clients and/or families. At three-month follow up, data showed that most beliefs, attitudes, and behavior intentions about counseling clients and families on this topic increased. Focus group findings indicated that training had a positive effect on participants' attitudes, beliefs, and behavioral intentions about counseling on access to lethal means.The findings of the present study offer additional evidence and implication for trainings of this type.

AB Objective: To estimate the burden of mental, neurological, substance use disorders and self-harm (MNSS) in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Method: We extracted 2017 data from the Global Burden of Disease online database. Based on a previously developed framework to classify and aggregate the burden of specific disorders and symptoms, we reestimated the MNSS burden to include suicide, alcohol use, drug use, specific neurological, and painful somatic symptom disorders. We analyzed age-sex-specific patterns within and between countries. Results: The MNSS burden is the largest of all disorder groupings. It is lowest in Mexico, intermediate in Canada, and highest in the United States. Exceptions are alcohol use, bipolar, conduct disorders, and epilepsy, which are highest in Mexico; and painful somatic syndromes and headaches, which are highest in Canada. The burden of drug use disorders in the United States is twice the burden in Canada, and 7 times the burden in Mexico. MNSS become the most burdensome of all disorder groups by age 10, staying at the top until age 60, and show a distinct pattern across the lifetime. The top three MNSS disorders for men are a combination of substance use disorders and self-harm (United States), with the addition of painful somatic syndromes (Canada), and headaches (Mexico). For women, the top three are headaches and depression (all countries), drug use (United States), neurocognitive disorders (Mexico), and painful somatic syndromes (Canada). Conclusion: MNSS are the most burdensome disease grouping and should be prioritized for funding in Canada, Mexico, and the United States.

AB The dramatic change in the political climate in the United States after the victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential elections sparked a heated debate in the intellectual circles about the nature, historical foundations and the future of the American democracy. The discussion centers on the topic of a "suicide of democracy", with the collapse of the Weimar Republic in Germany being its classic example, and the prospects for the Weimar scenario in the United States.
   From the Political Science viewpoint, the content of this discussion is of interest in at least three respects. First, it captures the truly significant changes in the American political system, indicating qualitative, if not irreversible, shifts. Second, it poses a methodological problem of measuring the degree of deformation of the democratic institutions. Third, it allows one to look at the United States in a comparative perspective, drawing on the experience of other countries.
   The article analyzes why the image of Weimar America is relevant for the political agenda of the United States, considers various interpretations of the meaning of the current changes, contours and basic parameters of the erosion of democracy and the system of separation of powers, polar assessments of the phenomenon of trumpism, as well as the ideas about the possibility of overcoming the political contradictions faced by one of the oldest democracies in the world. In the conclusion, the author examines the question of the Weimar paradigm of the collapse of democracies and demonstrates the extent to which the above discussed problems are specific to the United States, and to which extent they reflect global trends and can be integrated into the general theory of stability of democratic regimes.

AB Background: Comobidity of personality disorders (PDs) and alcohol dependence are considered to increase the risk for suicidal behavior. The aim of this study is to assess the influence of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder-fourth edition (DSM-IV) personality characteristics and comorbid axis I disorders on suicidal behavior in alcohol-dependent inpatients.
   Methods: Characteristics of alcohol dependence and suicidal behavior were obtained using the Semi-Structured Assessment on Genetics in Alcoholism (SSAGA). Personality disorder characteristics were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis 11 Disorders.
   Results: Three-hundred seventy-six treatment-seeking alcohol-dependent subjects, of whom 55% were diagnosed to have a PD and approximately 25% had a history of at least 1 suicide attempt, were enrolled into the study. Subjects with PDs in all clusters reported a higher rate of suicide attempt history, depression episodes, and depression during the most serious attempt. As indicated by univariate and multivarate analysis, this pattern of suicide attempt characteristics was most pronounced in borderline disordered subjects and alcoholic individuals who live alone.
   Conclusion: Subjects with alcohol dependence who have various comorbid PDs and depression deserve special attention in psychiatric care to prevent suicide. Psychotherapeutic strategies may have to be adapted to treat this high-risk population.

AB Objectives. To examine the relationship between suicide risk and hazardous drinking, depression, and anxiety, adjusting for demographics, among tribal college students across the United States. Methods. We invited tribal college students enrolled in 22 tribal colleges from fall 2014 and 2015 to participate in the Creating Campus Change study, a cross-sectional online/paper survey assessing alcohol use patterns and mental health outcomes. 3,239 students participated in the survey, yielding a response rate of 31.3%. We assessed alcohol use, depression, and general anxiety, along with demographic characteristics. We used the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview to assess suicide risk. Results. 8.5% indicated moderate or high suicide risk. In the final adjusted model, moderate/high depression was significantly associated with moderate/high suicide risk (OR = 6.64; 3.91-11.28, p < 0.001), as was moderate/high general anxiety (OR = 2.80; 1.58-4.97, p < 0.001), and moderate/high hazardous drinking (OR = 2.09; 1.19-3.66, p < 0.001). Conclusions. Students attending tribal colleges who report moderate/high levels of depression, anxiety, or hazardous drinking have a greater risk of suicidality. Identifying factors buffering the risk of suicidality could support policy changes necessary to address this critical public health issue.

AB Background: Inconsistent nomenclature and classification of suicidal behaviour have plagued the field of suicidology for a long time. Recently, the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) advocated for the usage of a specific classification system. Aim of the current study was to determine the extent of misdiagnosed acts of self-directed violence-controlling for the level of expertise in psychology/psychotherapy. Additionally, the effect of gender and diagnosis on misclassifications was assessed.
   Method: A total of 426 participants (laypersons, psychology students, psychotherapists-in-training, licensed psychotherapists) were presented with an array of case vignettes describing different acts of self-directed violence (e.g., non-suicidal self-directed violence, suicide attempt, suicide ideation) and were asked to make a classification. Gender and given diagnosis were varied systematically in two vignettes.
   Results: Overall 51.6% of the cases were misclassified (according to the Self-Directed Violence Classification System). The level of expertise was almost unrelated to classification correctness. Yet, psychotherapists were more confident about their judgments. Female gender of the character described in the vignette and an ascribed diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder were associated with higher mis-classification rates.
   Limitations: The validity of case vignettes is discussible.
   Conclusions: The results highlight the importance of more methodological and diagnostic training of psychologists regarding suicidal issues. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Non-legislative forms of means safety (i.e., safe firearm storage practices) have been promoted as a way to reduce elevated suicide risk found among firearm owners. However, evidence suggests that some firearm owners are less willing than others to engage in these practices. The current study aimed to understand factors that differentiate firearm owners' beliefs and behaviors that are relevant to suicide risk by examining differences between individuals for whom firearm ownership represents a central aspect of identity (i.e., primary firearm owners) versus firearm owners who primarily identify with some other demographic or occupational characteristic. Results of main analyses revealed that primary firearm owners were more likely to be male, were less likely to have experienced suicidal ideation, were less likely to store their firearms safely across a number of storage methods, and were less open to means safety across all storage methods. These findings highlight demographically which firearm owners may be more likely to view firearm ownership as central to their identity and also suggest that this identification may be associated with beliefs and behaviors that increase suicide risk. Future firearm suicide prevention efforts should focus on culturally competent discussions and messaging to find common ground with firearm owners and to increase the salience of suicide among firearm owners.

AB Although non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicide attempts (SA) frequently co-occur among youth, there is increasing evidence that both the risk factors and the phenomenology of the behaviors are distinct. This study examined how individuals who engage in NSSI only, individuals who attempt suicide only, and those who have histories of both NSSI and at least one suicide attempt may differ in terms of cognitions and perceived social support. Participants were 185 adolescents (78.1 % female) between the ages of 13 and 18 recruited from a psychiatric inpatient facility in the northeastern United States. One hundred forty-eight teens were identified with a history of self-injurious behavior and divided into three groups: NSSI only (n = 45), SA only (n = 24) or both NSSI and SA (NSSI+SA; n = 79). Analyses showed that the NSSI+SA group exhibited more cognitive errors, negative self-statements, and negative views of self, world, and future, as well as less perceived familial support than either the NSSI or SA only groups. There were no differences between groups on perceived support from teachers or peers. No significant demographic or diagnostic differences were found between the NSSI and SA groups. Limitations and clinical implications of the current research are discussed.

AB Objective: We estimated risks of suicidal behaviors in 2826 mood-disorder patients evaluated and followed in a Sardinian mood disorders research center over the past 30 years.
   Method: We determined rates of suicidal ideation, attempts, and suicides, with associated risk factors, in men and women with DSM-IV bipolar I (BP-I; n = 529), BP-II; (n = 314), or major depressive disorders (MDD; n = 1983), at risk for an average of 11 years of illness.
   Results: Observed rates (% of patients/year) of suicide ranked: BP-II (0.16) >= BP-I (0.14) > MDD (0.05); attempts: BP-I (1.52) > BP-II (0.82) > MDD (0.48); ideation: BP-II (42.7) > MDD (33.8) > BP-I (22.7). The ratio of attempts/suicides (lethality index) ranked: BP-II (5.12) < MDD (9.60) <= BP-I (10.8). Male/female risk-ratios were greater for suicide than attempts or ideation. One-third of all reported acts occurred within the first year of illness, and earliest among MDD patients. Factors associated independently with suicidal acts included BP diagnosis, hospitalizations/person, and early illness-onset; factors associated with suicidal ideation were having an affective temperament, BP-II diagnosis, and higher suicidality-corrected depression score at intake.
   Conclusion: Suicidal behaviors were more prevalent among BPD than MDD out-patients.

AB Background. This article examines the hypothesis that the six U.S. states with the highest rates of road traffic deaths (group 1 states) also had above-average rates of other forms of injury such as falling, poisoning, drowning, fire, suffocation, homicide, and suicide, and also for the retail trade and construction industries. The converse, second hypothesis, for the six states with the lowest rates of road traffic deaths (group 2 states) is also examined.
   Results: Data for these 12 states for the period 1983 to 1995 included nine categories of unintentional and four categories of intentional injury. Seventy-four percent of the group 1 states conformed to the first hypothesis, and 85% of the group 2 states conformed to the second hypothesis.
   Conclusion: Group 1 states are likely to exhibit above-average rates for most other categories of injury death, whereas group 2 states are even more likely to exhibit below-average rates for most other categories of injury death.

AB Objective: Approximately 70% of all US suicides are among working-age adults. This study was to determine whether and how 12-month suicidal ideation and suicide attempt were associated with specific occupations among currently employed adults aged 18-64 in the U.S.
   Methods: Data were from 184,300 currently employed adults who participated in the 2008-2013 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). NSDUH provides nationally representative data on suicidal ideation and suicide attempt. Descriptive analyses and multivariable logistic regressions were conducted.
   Results: Among currently employed adults aged 18-64 in the U.S., 3.5% had suicidal ideation in the past 12 months (3.1% had suicidal ideation only, and 0.4% had suicidal ideation and attempted suicide). Compared with adults in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations (model adjusted prevalence (MAP) = 1.6%), adults in the following occupations were 3.0-3.6 times more likely to have suicidal ideation in the past year (model adjusted relative risks (MARRs) = 3.0-3.6): lawyers, judges, and legal support workers (MAP = 4.8%), social scientists and related workers (MAP = 5.4%), and media and communication workers (MAP = 5.8%).
   Conclusions: Among employed adults aged 18-64 in the U.S., the 12-month prevalence of suicidal ideation varies by occupations. Adults in occupations that are at elevated risk for suicidal ideation may warrant focused suicide prevention. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Citizens of the United States own more firearms than those in any other country, and the majority of the firearms owned are handguns. Given such prevalence, surprisingly few studies have been published describing the characteristics of deaths due to handguns. To address this gap, nonaccidental handgun deaths examined at the Bexar County Medical Examiner's Office between 2000 and 2010 were reviewed. A total of 1450 cases were identified, including 797 suicides and 653 homicides. Age, range of fire, location of wound, and manner of death were analyzed. The average age of suicide victims (46.7 years) was found to be greater than that of homicides (34.3 years). Suicidal wounds tended to be contact wounds to the head; abdominal, extremity, back, and multiple wound locations were more common in homicides as were distant and intermediate wounds. Handgun wounds to the forehead, side of head, submental, and intraoral locations were significantly more common in suicide, whereas those to the face, apex of the head, and back of the head were more common in homicides. Where possible, likelihood ratios were calculated to determine relative likelihood of suicide or homicide for specific wound locations and ranges. While each death should be analyzed based on its unique circumstances and not solely its statistical probability, these data may help inform the pathologist's conclusions.

AB Objective. Firearm violence is a significant public health problem in the United States, and alcohol is frequently involved. This article reviews existing research on the relationships between alcohol misuse; ownership, access to, and use of firearms; and the commission of firearm violence, and discusses the policy implications of these findings.
   Method. Narrative review augmented by new tabulations of publicly-available data.
   Results. Acute and chronic alcohol misuse is positively associated with firearm ownership, risk behaviors involving firearms, and risk for perpetrating both interpersonal and self-directed firearm violence. In an average month, an estimated 8.9 to 11.7 million firearm owners binge drink. For men, deaths from alcohol-related firearm violence equal those from alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes. Enforceable policies restricting access to firearms for persons who misuse alcohol are uncommon. Policies that restrict access on the basis of other risk factors have been shown to reduce risk for subsequent violence.
   Conclusion. The evidence suggests that restricting access to firearms for persons with a documented history of alcohol misuse would be an effective violence prevention measure. Restrictions should rely on unambiguous definitions of alcohol misuse to facilitate enforcement and should be rigorously evaluated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   BEHAVIORS; IDEATION; STRESS; TRENDS
AB Tragic events across the United States in recent years have highlighted the important relationship between suicidal impulses and violent attacks on others. Research suggests that suicide and interpersonal violence share a number of important risk and protective factors across multiple domains of influence. These include problem-solving and coping skills, characteristics of school and community environments such as bullying, intolerance, and prejudice. Taken together, this evidence suggests that prevention approaches can integrate suicide and violence prevention by focusing on shared influences, in particular, strategies that promote good general coping skills and family functioning have potential to increase both the effectiveness and efficiency of prevention efforts. While several programs have demonstrated evidence of reductions in suicidality or in youth interpersonal violence, there have been few attempts to achieve the benefits that could come from an integrated violence prevention approach. A major obstacle is that program outcomes tend to be narrowly defined and discipline-specific, hindering the development of productive partnerships across problem areas. We argue that such partnerships are needed to bridge the gap between suicide and violence prevention. Increasing collaboration across fields can help facilitate future research and program development in concrete ways by beginning to evaluate whether current programs can simultaneously decrease both self- and other-directed violence. Programs meeting such a standard should be widely disseminated and implemented. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: This study examined the association between pain and suicidality in the general US population.
   Method: Using data front the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication, we assessed relationships between four measures of pain (back and neck. headache, other nonarthritic pain and summary score of the count of these conditions) and 12-month suicidal thoughts, plans and attempts using chi-square tests and logistic regression models. Multivariate logistic regression models controlled for demographic characteristics, chronic health conditions. mood, anxiety and Substance use disorders.
   Results: In multivariate models adjusting for concurrent psychiatric disorders and other chronic medical conditions, suicidal ideation was associated with head pain (OR 1.9, 95% CI: 1.2, 3.0) and the pain summary score (OR 1.2. 95% CI: 1.0, 1.4). Suicide attempt was also associated with head pain (OR 2.3. 95% CI: 1.2, 4.4) and pain summary score (OR 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.6). Other nonarthritic pain was associated with suicide attempts (OR4.0. 95% CI: 1.8, 9.1).
   Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of pain as a potentially independent risk factor for suicide, particularly among those with head pain or multiple forms of co-occuring pain. Individuals suffering from chronic pain may be particularly appropriate for suicide screening and intervention efforts. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: This study analyzed trends in suicides occurring after a psychiatric hospitalization during more than a decade of significant structural changes in mental health services in Finland-that is, deinstitutionalization, downsizing of inpatient care, and decentralization. Methods: Retrospective register data on completed suicides and psychiatric inpatient treatments were collected for the periods 1985-1991 and 1995-2001, representing service provision before and after significant structural changes. The data were used to produce an estimate for a change in postdischarge suicide risk. Results: In both periods, a fifth of suicide victims had been psychiatrically hospitalized within the preceding year. Among persons hospitalized, the risk of suicide was greater in 1985-1991 than in 1995-2001 for both one week after discharge (risk ratio [RR]=1.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]= 1.38-1.62) and one year after discharge (RR=1.25, CI=1.19-1.30). When types of disorders were analyzed separately, the relative risk of suicide one year postdischarge for those hospitalized in the earlier period was greater for patients with schizophrenia (RR=1.26, CI=1.17-1.36) and patients with affective disorders (RR=1.60, CI=1.48-1.73). In parallel with general development of inpatient psychiatric services, in 1995-2001 the inpatient treatment periods preceding suicides were significantly shorter (a mean +/- SD of 45 +/- 340 days in 1995-2001, compared with a mean of 98 +/- 558 days in 1985-1991), the number of individual patients treated in the hospital for schizophrenia spectrum disorders was lower (26% compared with 36%), and the number treated for affective disorders was higher (45% compared with 35%). Conclusions: The restructuring and downsizing of mental health services was not associated with any increase in suicides immediately (one week) or one year postdischarge. Instead, the risk of these suicides decreased significantly between the two time periods among several diagnostic categories. Although the role of psychiatric hospitalization in general may have changed over time, patients who are hospitalized now may be less suicidal after discharge. Our results indicate, in terms of postdischarge suicides, that the downsizing of psychiatric hospitals has been a success. However, there is still a substantial need for better recognition of suicidal risk among psychiatric patients.

TI Inequality in mortality by occupation related to economic crisis from

AB The mortality rate for Japanese males aged 30-59 years in managerial and professional spiked in 2000 and remains worse than that of other occupations possibly associated with the economic downturn of the 1990s and the global economic stagnation after 2008. The present study aimed to assess temporal occupation-specific mortality trends from 1980 to 2010 for Japanese males aged 30-59 years for major causes of death. We obtained data from the Occupation-specificVital Statistics. We calculated age-standardized mortality rates for the four leading causes of death (all cancers, suicide, ischaemic heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease). We used a generalized estimating equation model to determine specific effects of the economic downturn after 2000. The age-standardized mortality rate for the total working-age population steadily declined up to 2010 in all major causes of death except suicide. Managers had a higher risk of mortality in all leading causes of death compared with before 1995. Mortality rates among unemployed people steadily decreased for all cancers and ischaemic heart disease. Economic downturn may have caused the prolonged increase in suicide mortality. Unemployed people did not experience any change in mortality due to suicide and cerebrovascular disease and saw a decline in cancer and ischemic heart disease mortality, perhaps because the basic properties of Japan's social welfare system were maintained even during economic recession.

AB Chrono-epidemiology is the study of the distribution of health events according to time. The time intervals taken into account have cyclic patterns and include cireadian, weekly, seasonal, and circannual rhythms. In the behavioural field, chrono-epidemiology can be and has been applied to studies concerning the causes of death (suicide and homicide), clinical events such as admissions to and contacts with mental healthcare services, and the seasonal distribution of crime involving the use of violence. Frequently reported findings include clear circadian and seasonal rhythms present in the phenomenon of suicide (rhythms more evident in the case of violent suicide); seasonal rhythms in the expression of aggression by patients hospitalised for mental illness; and a circannual recurrence of crimes with a violent component. The intrinsic circadian and seasonal rhythms of some neuronal systems, particularly those of serotonin, involved in the control of mood and impulses, are thought to favour the behavioural rhythms observed, although the contribution of socio-environmental factors, such as the fluctuation of supportive networks according to time, is also acknowledged. By demonstrating non-casual recurrence of certain behaviour and by exploring the socio-biological basis of the rhythms beneath these recurrences, chrono-epidemiology may offer important etiologic and preventive clues to the understanding of the biological and environmental correlates of aggressive behaviour.

TI Kurt Tucholsky as prophet of European unity
SO GERMAN LIFE AND LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
AB Whilst Kurt Tucholsky has long been recognised as the leading left-wing intellectual, polemicist and satirist of the Weimar Republic, his enthusiasm for the cause of united Europe has only recently come to light. In the late 1920s he wrote frequently of the need to abandon absolute state sovereignty in favour of a Federal United States of Europe, and even anticipated Mikhail Gorbachev's concept of a common European house. His reasoning was to be followed by subsequent German leaders from Adenauer to Kohl: after the disastrous Treaty of Versailles and with the League of Nations providing a broken reed, a united Europe would be the only way to prevent another still more bloody war. However, Tucholsky had no clear idea of how Europe could be brought together, remained somewhat sceptical about the Pan-Europe model of Count Coudenhove-Kalergi, and did not even comment on the European Federal Union proposed in 1930 by the French Foreign Minister, Briand. Three years later, all the plans for European unity were frustrated by the triumph of Nazism and Tucholsky lapsed into despairing silence and suicide.

AB Deliberate self-harm (DSH; i.e., nonfatal self-poisoning or self-injury) occurs much more frequently than suicide, yet there has been little detailed investigation of the comparative rates of DSH and suicide. We conducted a study of how rates of DSH relate to suicide rates across the life cycle by gender and by method of estimation of DSH rates, using 10 years of data from a local system for monitoring DSH presentations to a general hospital and national and local suicide statistics. The rate-ratio of DSH to suicide was 36 (95% CI 34.9-37.1) based on annual person-based rates of DSH episodes and was nearly five times higher in females (87.9; 9.5% CI 84.4-91.6) than in males (18.7; 95% CI 17.9-19.6). The ratio varied markedly across the life cycle, decreasing from more than 2 00 in teenagers to less than 10 in persons aged 6 0 years and over. The difference in the ratio between females and males also decreased over the life cycle. There were very similar findings when local suicide rates were used. These patterns were replicated when the data were analyzed, first, on the basis of all episodes of DSH during the study period, but with expectedly larger DSH:suicide ratios (e.g., overall 52.7; 95% CI 51.4-54.1), and second, on the basis of individual persons only engaging in DSH during the study period, but with smaller ratios (e.g., overall 26.2; 95% CI 25.4-27.2). The DSH:suicide rate ratios for those with high and low suicidal intent were similar within age groups except for those aged 60 years and over, in whom there was a greater proportion of high intent acts. These findings illustrate how the nature of self-harming behavior may vary in intention across the life cycle and between the genders, and provide a basis for further comparative work of this kind.

AB Objective: This study aims to investigate the implications of the heterogeneous cohort composition on depression trajectories of older adults in the United States and England. Methods: Using growth curve models to identify depressive symptom trajectories and data spanning six waves over 10 years (2002-2012) from the U.S. Health Retirement Study and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, community-dwelling Americans and Britons aged 50 years and older were studied. Depressive symptoms were measured using the eight-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Results: The sample included 11,919 respondents (7,095 women [59.53%]) in the United States and 10,606 respondents (5,802 women [54.7%]) in England aged 50 and older. Older cohorts were shown to have higher depressive symptoms than younger cohorts in the United States and England. The trajectories of depression of older cohorts, particularly those of the prewar cohorts in both countries and the war cohort in England, followed a U-shape. Conversely, the trajectories of depression of the younger cohort, particularly those of the postwar cohorts in both countries and the war cohort in the United States, took an inverted U-shape. Conclusion: The trajectories of depression in later life between cohorts took different shapes. This finding may lead to the development of more cost-effective policies for treating depression in later life.

AB This study investigated the relation between suicide attempts and immigrant generation status using the Latino subset of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, a school-based, nationally representative sample. This study also examined whether generation status predicted risk factors associated with elevated suicide behaviors, namely illicit substance use, problematic alcohol use, and depressive symptoms. Finally, hypothesizing that elevated depressive symptoms and substance use mediate the relation between immigrant generation status and suicide attempts among Latino adolescents, a path model was tested. Our findings revealed immigrant generation status was a determinant for suicide attempts, problematic alcohol use, repeated marijuana use, and repeated other drug use for Latino adolescents. US-born Latinos with immigrant parents (i.e., second-generation youth) were 2.87 (95% CI, 1.34, 6.14) times more likely to attempt suicide, 2.27 (95% CI, 1.53, 3.35) times more likely to engage in problematic alcohol use, 2.56 (95% CI, 1.62, 4.05) times more likely to engage in repeated marijuana use, and 2.28 (95% CI, 1.25, 4.17) times more likely to engage in repeated other drug use than were foreign-born youth (i.e., first-generation youth). Later-generations of US-born Latino youth with US-born parents were 3.57 (95% CI, 1.53-8.34) times more likely to attempt suicide, 3.34 (95% CI, 2.18-5.11) times more likely to engage in problematic alcohol use, 3.90 (95% CI, 2.46, 6.20) times more likely to engage in repeated marijuana use, and 2.80 (95% CI, 1.46, 5.34) times more likely to engage in repeated other drug use than were first-generation youth. Results from the path analysis indicated that repeated other drug use may mediate the effect of generation status on suicide attempts.

TI Gun Violence: Two Medical Students' Hometown Connection to This Public
   Health Crisis
SO ACADEMIC MEDICINE
LA English
DT Editorial Material
ID OWNERSHIP; HOMICIDE; STATES; RATES; LAW
AB The school shooting in Parkland, Florida in February 2018 left 17 people dead and countless other children and teachers with physical and psychological trauma that will require decades of healing. As Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School alumni and current medical students, the authors of this Invited Commentary contend that they are in a unique position to advocate on behalf of their neighbors, classmates, and future patients. Since the authors began medical school in 2015, there have been 19 mass shootings in the United States, resulting in 253 deaths. During this same time period, there have been nearly 100,000 gun-related deaths in the United States. While 60.7% of those gun deaths were suicides, the public must not, and should not, attribute all gun violence to the spectrum of psychiatric diagnoses. Several studies have shown that increased access to firearms directly increases the rate of one of the United States' most pressing public health issues-gun violence. Despite this fact, and as the result of misguided health policies like the Dickey Amendment, the funding for research on gun violence pales in comparison with that for other leading causes of death. Consequently, the health care community has long been without adequate data to engage in evidence-based gun violence prevention and education efforts. As two students on the cusp of beginning their medical careers, the authors argue that they and other health care providers can no longer sit idly on the sidelines as this public health crisis continues to impact the United States.

AB BackgroundMigraine has been associated with mental illness, and may also be associated with increased risk of suicidal behavior.
   ObjectiveThe aim of this article was to examine the association between migraine headache and self-harm and suicide mortality using population-based health administrative data from Ontario, Canada.
   MethodsThe sample included 101,114 participants in a population-based health survey in the province of Ontario, Canada, who responded to the survey in 2003, 2005, or 2007, and provided health card numbers for linkage to population-based health administrative data. Participants self-reported a physician diagnosis of migraine headache. Heath administrative data were used to calculate (1) Follow-up time until first presentation to the emergency department for intentional self-harm; (2) Follow-up time until death by suicide. Proportional subdistribution hazards regression was used to compare time until death among those with and without history of migraine, after accounting for competing risks of death and adjusting for confounders.
   ResultsPhysician diagnosis of migraine was reported by 11.2% of the sample (11,314 individuals). Mean follow-up time was 7.3 years. Emergency department visits for self-harm during the follow-up period were almost 50% more likely in those with migraine (76.4 vs 35.7 per 100,000 person years; adjusted hazard ratio=1.48; 95%CI: 1.11,1.96). Death by suicide was rare with only 55 suicides in the follow-up period (7.45 per 100,000 person-years). Risk of suicide was similar for both those with and without history of migraine headache (adjusted hazard ratio=0.60; 95%CI: 0.22,1.65).
   ConclusionsPhysician diagnosis of migraine headache was found to be prospectively associated with increased risk of deliberate self-harm, but there was no evidence linking it to suicide mortality. Definitively linking migraine to death by suicide may require very large samples. Health care professionals should consider monitoring suicidal risk in individuals with migraine headache.

AB Objective
   The rapid proliferation of machine learning research using electronic health records to classify healthcare outcomes offers an opportunity to address the pressing public health problem of adolescent suicidal behavior. We describe the development and evaluation of a machine learning algorithm using natural language processing of electronic health records to identify suicidal behavior among psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents.
   Methods
   Adolescents hospitalized on a psychiatric inpatient unit in a community health system in the northeastern United States were surveyed for history of suicide attempt in the past 12 months. A total of 73 respondents had electronic health records available prior to the index psychiatric admission. Unstructured clinical notes were downloaded from the year preceding the index inpatient admission. Natural language processing identified phrases from the notes associated with the suicide attempt outcome. We enriched this group of phrases with a clinically focused list of terms representing known risk and protective factors for suicide attempt in adolescents. We then applied the random forest machine learning algorithm to develop a classification model. The model performance was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy.
   Results
   The final model had a sensitivity of 0.83, specificity of 0.22, AUC of 0.68, a PPV of 0.42, NPV of 0.67, and an accuracy of 0.47. The terms mostly highly associated with suicide attempt clustered around terms related to suicide, family members, psychiatric disorders, and psychotropic medications.
   Conclusion
   This analysis demonstrates modest success of a natural language processing and machine learning approach to identifying suicide attempt among a small sample of hospitalized adolescents in a psychiatric setting.

AB Food insufficiency has been shown to be associated with poor health, academic and psychosocial outcomes in American children, but the relationship between food insufficiency and depressive disorders in U.S. adolescents has not been studied. Further, there are no national estimates of the prevalence of depressive disorders for U.S. adolescents, nor investigation of associations with sociodemographic characteristics using national data. Therefore, we analyzed data for 15- and 16-y-old adolescents from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). Depressive disorders and suicidal symptoms were assessed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. Adolescents were classified as "food insufficient" if a family respondent reported that the family sometimes or often did not have enough to eat. The prevalence of depression outcomes is reported by sociodemographic characteristics. Odds ratios for associations with food insufficiency are reported, adjusted for sociodemographic factors. Overall, lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder was 6.3% and of dysthymia, 5.4%. Almost 5% of 15- to 16-y-old adolescents reported that they had ever attempted suicide and 38.8% reported at least one suicidal symptom. Female adolescents were significantly more likely than males to have had dysthymia, any depressive disorder and all symptoms of suicide. Low income adolescents were less likely to report suicide ideation than high income adolescents, but there were no other differences by family income. Food-insufficient adolescents were significantly more likely to have had dysthymia, thoughts of death, a desire to die and have attempted suicide. There is a strong association between food insufficiency and depressive disorder and suicidal symptoms in U.S. adolescents.

TI Access to Psychotropic Medication via Prescription Is Associated With

AB Objective: Whether physical access to psychotropic medication via prescription (ie, prescribed access) is associated with use of psychotropic medication as a means of subsequent suicide attempt remains unclear. In a population of suicide attempters, we investigated whether prescribed access to any psychotropic medication increased the likelihood of using any psychotropic drug in a suicide attempt and whether prescribed access to a specific psychotropic drug type increased the likelihood of using that specific psychotropic drug type in an attempt.
   Methods: Case-control study design was used. We identified individuals receiving care for a suicide attempt (fatal or nonfatal) in emergency department and inpatient settings from a US insurance claims dataset (2006-2013) using relevant ICD-9-CM codes. Cases used a psychotropic drug in their suicide attempt, while controls used another method. Exposed individuals filled a psychotropic drug prescription within 90 days prior to the attempt. Multivariable logistic regression estimated odds ratios.
   Results: A population of 27,876 (cases = 10,158, controls = 17,718) was included. Anxiolytics were used most in attempts (n = 6,037, 59.4%), followed by antidepressants (n = 3,573, 35.2%), antipsychotics or mood stabilizers (n = 1,168, 11.5%), and stimulants (n = 368, 3.6%). Thirteen percent (n = 1,316) used more than 1 type of psychotropic drug in the attempt. Across all psychotropic drug groups evaluated, individuals using psychotropic medication in a suicide attempt were significantly more likely to have had prescribed access (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.7; 95% CI, 1.6-1.9), with the highest drug type-specific odds ratios for antipsychotics or mood stabilizers (aOR = 6.5; 95% CI, 5.4-7.7) and stimulants (aOR = 7.6; 95% CI, 5.5-10.5).
   Conclusions: Individuals at high risk for suicide with prescribed access to any psychotropic medication should be targeted for means safety interventions.

TI Antidepressant Discontinuation and Risk of Suicide Attempt: A
   Retrospective, Nested Case-Control Study
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
ID DEPRESSION
AB Objective: Prior efforts to assess the impact of antidepressant use on risk of suicide attempt focused on antidepressant initiation or duration of use. Gaps remain in understanding risks associated with antidepressant discontinuation in the context of the drug regimen. We assessed the effects of antidepressant discontinuation on the risk of suicide attempt.
   Method: We report a nested case-control study of suicide attempt with at least 12 months of prior observation. A retrospective cohort of 2.4 million patients with depression (ICD-9 codes 296.2, 296.3, 300.4, and 311), aged 5-89 years, was created using standard Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) criteria; from this cohort, cases (n = 10,456) and controls (n = 41,815) were selected for study. Data were from a large, national, longitudinal, integrated claims database of managed care enrollees in the United States from calendar years 1999 through 2006.
   Results: Compared to controls, cases were more likely to have used antidepressants, to have had multiple antidepressants, and to have had prior depressive episodes and inpatient stays that involved depression. After adjusting for confounding due to depression severity, comorbidities, and other medications, antidepressant use showed a protective effect for suicide attempt (OR = 0.62, P<.001). Compared to prior therapy, antidepressant discontinuation had a significant risk for suicide attempt (OR = 1.61, P<.05). Antidepressant initiation had the highest risk for suicide attempt (OR = 3.42, P<.05), followed by titration (titration up, OR = 2.62; down, OR = 2.19; P<.05).
   Conclusions: Substantial confounding exists in examining the link between antidepressant use and suicide attempt, specifically regarding those factors associated with characteristics of depression. Antidepressant discontinuation showed a significant risk for suicide attempt, as did the period of an abbreviated trial, that is, stopping before a therapeutic regimen of 56 days had been reached. The highest risk was associated with initiation, a finding consistent with other studies, closely followed by periods of dosing changes and discontinuation. Patients should be closely monitored during these periods. J Clin Psychiatry 2009;70(8):1069-1077 (C) Copyright 2009 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB Background Drug overdoses and suicides have been rising since 2000 and are major contributors to a 3-year decline in US life expectancy. Studies suggest that injured workers have elevated rates of depression and opioid use, but no studies have measured excess mortality related to these risks. Materials and methods We linked New Mexico workers' compensation data for 100 806 workers injured in 1994 through 2000 with Social Security Administration earnings and mortality data through 2013 and National Death Index cause of death data. We then estimated the association between receiving lost-time workers' compensation benefits and mortality hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on Fine and Gray cause-specific subdistribution hazards for common causes of death and for drug-related, suicide, and alcohol-related mortality. Results There was almost a 3-fold increase in combined drug-related and suicide mortality hazard among women (HR = 2.63, 95% CI = 1.91-3.64) and a substantial increase among men (HR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.13-1.79). Circulatory disease mortality hazard was elevated for men (HR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.05-1.50). Conclusion Workplace injuries severe enough to require more than a week off work may impair workers' long-term health and well-being. Drug-related deaths and suicides may be important contributors to the long-term excess mortality of injured workers. Improved workplace conditions, improved pain treatment, better treatment of substance use disorders, and treatment of postinjury depression may substantially reduce mortality consequent to workplace injuries.

AB Introduction: The United States (US) leads all high income countries in gunshot wound (GSW) deaths. However, as a result of two decades of reduced federal support, study of GSW has been largely neglected. In this paper we describe the current state of GSW hospitalizations in the US using population-based data.
   Patients and methods: We conducted an observational study of patients hospitalized for GSW in the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS) 2004 - 2013. Our primary outcome is mortality after admission and we model its associations with gender, race, age, intent, severity of injury and weapon type, as well as providing temporal trends in hospital charges.
   Results: Each year approximately 30,000 patients are hospitalized for GSW, and 2500 die in hospital. Men are 9 times as likely to be hospitalized for GSW as women, but are less likely to die. Twice as many blacks are hospitalized for GSW as non-Hispanic whites. In-hospital mortality for blacks and non-Hispanic whites was similar when controlled for other factors. Most GSW (63%) are the result of assaults which overwhelmingly involve blacks; accidents are also common (23%) and more commonly involve non-Hispanic whites. Although suicide is much less common (8.3%), it accounts for 32% of all deaths; most of which are older non-Hispanic white males. Handguns are the most common weapon reported, and have the highest mortality rate (8.4%). During the study period, the annual rate of hospitalizations for GSW remained stable at 80 per 100,000 hospital admissions; median inflation-adjusted hospital charges have steadily increased by approximately 20% annually from $ 30,000 to $ 56,000 per hospitalization. The adjusted odds for mortality decreased over the study period. Although extensively reported, GSW inflicted by police and terrorists represent few hospitalizations and very few deaths.
   Conclusions: The preponderance GSW hospitalizations resulting from assaults on young black males and suicides among older non-Hispanic white males have continued unabated over the last decade with escalating costs. As with other widespread threats to the public wellbeing, federally funded research is required if effective interventions are to be developed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID CHOKING GAME; UNITED-STATES; RISK-FACTORS; RATES; PREVENTION
AB Purpose: Rates of suicide are increasing rapidly among youth. Social media messages and online games promoting suicide are a concern for parents and clinicians. We examined the timing and location of social media posts about one alleged youth suicide game to better understand the degree to which social media data can provide earlier public health awareness.
   Methods: We conducted a search of all public social media posts and news articles on the Blue Whale Challenge (BWC), an alleged suicide game, from January 1, 2013, through June 30, 2017. Data were retrieved through multiple keyword search; sources included social media platforms Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, Tumblr, as well as blogs, forums, and news articles. Posts were classified into three categories: individual "pro"-BWC posts (support for game), individual "anti"-BWC posts (opposition to game), and media reports. Timing and location of posts were assessed.
   Results: Overall, 95,555 social media posts and articles about the BWC were collected. In total, over one-quarter (28.3%) were "pro"-BWC. The first U.S. news article related to the BWC was published approximately 4 months after the first English language U.S. social media post about the BWC and 9 months after the first U.S. social media post in any language. By the close of the study period, "pro"-BWC posts had spread to 127 countries.
   Conclusions: Novel online risks to mental health, such as prosuicide games or messages, can spread rapidly and globally. Better understanding social media and Web data may allow for detection of such threats earlier than is currently possible.

ID SUICIDE
AB This paper analyzes mortality rates for 3 of the main causes of deaths between the ages of 15 and 34 (motor vehicle injuries, homicide, and suicide) from 1950 to 1996, and across 26 countries. Average sex ratios and age patterns and the trends in age- and sex-standardized mortality rates are analyzed for each cause. Overall, youth violent mortality levels have been remarkably stable since the 1950s. As mortality due to other causes has receded, the contribution of these three causes has increased from 25 to 40 percent between the 1950s and the mid-1970s, and has remained above 40 percent since. Last, a principal component analysis is performed to summarize the variance in age-, sex-, and cause-specific rates over time and across countries. This summary representation of international differences displays regional clusters and emphasizes the "outlying" position of the United States among industrialized nations.

AB Pediatric mortality rates in the US have declined since 1999, although rates among non-Hispanic black and American Indian/Alaska Native children remain higher than those among non-Hispanic white children. We used mortality data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ascertain whether children living in rural areas experienced declines in mortality over the period 1999-2017 that paralleled those for the nation as a whole. Throughout the study period and across all age groups, rural children experienced higher mortality rates than their urban peers. Among rural children, non-Hispanic black infants and American Indian/Alaska Native children were particularly at risk. To reduce unnecessary rural pediatric and adolescent deaths, we recommend ongoing surveillance of rural children's health accompanied by policies targeting the leading causes of death in this population: unintentional injury and suicide.

AB Suicide is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality in many countries, but little is known about the epidemiology of suicide and suicidal behavior among pregnant women in the USA. We sought to examine trends and provide nationally representative estimates for suicidal behavior (including suicidal ideation and suicide and self-inflicted injury) among pregnant women from 2006 to 2012 in the USA. Pregnant women aged 12-55 years were identified through pregnancy- and delivery-related hospitalization records from the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample. Suicidal behavior was identified by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Annual, nationwide estimates and trends were determined using discharge and hospital weights. The prevalence of suicidal ideation more than doubled from 2006 to 2012 (47.5 to 115.0 per 100,000 pregnancy- and delivery-related hospitalizations), whereas the prevalence of suicide and self-inflicted injury remained stable. Nearly 10 % of suicidal behavior occurred in the 12-18-year group, showing the highest prevalence per 100,000 pregnancy- and delivery-related hospitalizations (158.8 in 2006 and 308.7 in 2012) over the study period. For suicidal ideation, blacks had higher prevalence than whites; women in the lowest income quartile had the highest prevalence. Although the prevalence of suicidal behavior was higher among hospitalizations with depression diagnoses, more than 30 % of hospitalizations were for suicidal behavior without depression diagnoses. Our findings highlight the increasing burden and racial differences in suicidal ideation among US pregnant women. Targeted suicide prevention efforts are needed for high-risk pregnant women including teens, blacks, and low-income women.

AB This article presents new data on the nature of suicidal crises in college students. Data were collected from over 26,000 undergraduate and graduate students at 70 colleges and universities. An anonymous Web-based survey was designed to provide insight into the full spectrum of suicidal thought, intent, and action among college students. The authors discuss implications of these data and outline a new, problem-focused paradigm for conceptualizing the problem of college student suicidality and for guiding institutional policies and interventions at multiple points along the continuum of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The proposed paradigm encompasses and expands on the current model of treating individuals in crisis in order to act preventively to reduce both prevalence and incidence of all forms of suicidality among college students.

AB The prevalence of immolation by fire in France is uncertain. We carried out a retrospective epidemiological study on immolations between 2011 and 2016 at the burn treatment centre at the hopital Saint-Louis in Paris. We studied the prevalence and characteristics of patients entering hospital for this reason. Between 2011 and 2016, a total of 1098 patients were hospitalized in the centre, of which 50 were admitted for immolation, i.e. five percent of the hospitalized population. The average age at entry was 46 years, and they were mostly men (62%). All but one was a suicide attempt. The average total burn area was 34.5%, and the average length of stay in the centre was 53 days. The products used for the immolation were mostly white spirit, alcohol or gasoline. Nine (18%) out of the 50 patients died, burned at 62.5% on average. A psychiatric history was reported in 35 patients and 21 had previously attempted suicide; nine patients were chronic alcoholics and four were drug addicts. The most frequently reported reasons for the suicide attempt were sentimental breakdown, death of a relative or financial problem. The prevalence of immolation in our study is very low compared to that found in developing countries. The majority of our cohort is composed of patients with a history of psychiatric disorders. The history of attempted suicide is also a major risk factor for committing suicidal acts by immolation. Prevention measures should be implemented to reduce this risk. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Background. Previous studies that have examined genetic influences on suicidal behaviour were confounded by genetic vulnerability for psychiatric risk factors. The present study examines genetic influences on suicidality (i.e. suicidal ideation and/or suicide attempt) after controlling for the inheritance of psychiatric disorders.
   Methods. Sociodemographics, combat exposure, lifetime DSM-III-R major depression, bipolar disorder, childhood conduct disorder, adult antisocial personality disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, drug dependence, alcohol dependence and lifetime suicidal ideation and attempt were assessed in 3372 twin pairs from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry who were assessed in 1987 and 1992. Genetic risk factors for suicidality were examined in a multinomial logistic regression model. Additive genetic, shared environmental and non-shared environmental effects on suicidality were estimated using structural equation modelling, controlling for other risk factors.
   Results. The prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt were 16.1 % and 2.4 % respectively. In a multinomial regression model, co-twin's suicidality, being white, unemployment, being other than married, medium combat exposure and psychiatric disorders were significant predictors for suicidal ideation. Co-twin's suicidality, unemployment, marital disruption, low education attainment and psychiatric disorders (except childhood conduct disorder) were significant predictors for suicide attempt. Model-fitting suggested that suicidal ideation was influenced by additive genetic (36 %) and non-shared environmental (64 %) effects, while suicide attempt was affected by additive genetic (17 %), shared environmental (19 %) and non-shared environmental (64 %) effects.
   Conclusions. There may be a genetic susceptibility specific to both suicidal ideation and suicide attempt in men, which is not explained by the inheritance of common psychiatric disorders.

AB Despite a significant improvement in the US maternal mortality ratio since the early 1900s, it still represents a substantial and frustrating burden, particularly given the fact that - essentially - no progress has been made in most US States since 1982. Additionally, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stated that most cases are probably preventable. Two disheartening issues within this topic include a gross underestimation of the magnitude of maternal mortality - particularly before 1987, but which likely persists to a lesser degree today - and the continued significant racial disparity in maternal mortality. Explanations for the plateau in maternal mortality include the recent trend of delayed childbearing, with the potential accompanying complications associated with older reproductive age (particularly over 35 years) and multiparity. The impressive increase in multifetal pregnancies related to delayed childbearing and assisted reproductive technology also plays a role. Finally, peripartum cardiomyopathy has become an increasingly recognized source of maternal mortality. Pregnancy-related mortality is largely accounted for by thromboembolic disease, hemorrhage, hypertension and its associated complications, and infection. However, since the inclusion of maternal deaths occurring after 42 days post-delivery as pregnancy related, traumatic injuries - including homicides and suicides - are an alarming source of maternal mortality. An especially important contemporary issue to consider within this topic is cesarean delivery "on maternal request", opponents of which cite concerns not only for immediate morbidity and mortality increased over that associated with a vaginal birth, but also for potential morbidity and mortality associated with future pregnancies.

TI Premeditated <i>versus</i> "passionate": patterns of homicide related to

SO JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH

DT Article

ID DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; SUICIDE; ASSOCIATION; FEMICIDE; HEALTH
AB Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is prevalent but underrecognized; at least 25% of United States women experience IPV within their lifetime. We examined the most severe consequence of IPV by exploring the patterns of death from IPV in a statewide database of homicide victims.
   Materials and methods: This is a retrospective review of the Colorado Violent Death Reporting System from 2004 to 2015. Deaths were coded as IPV if the primary relationship between the suspect and victim fell into the following categories: spouse, ex-spouse, girlfriend/boyfriend, and ex-girlfriend/ex-boyfriend.
   Results: We identified a total of 2279 homicide victims, with 295 cases of IPV homicide (12.9%). The majority was female victims of a male partner (n = 240, 81.4%). In nearly half of these (n = 108, 45%), the male suspect subsequently died by suicide as part of the same incident. These homicide-suicide incidents were more likely than homicide alone to involve a spousal relationship, more likely to involve firearms and less likely to involve intoxication or preceding arguments. They had a distinct demographic profile from other victims of IPV, mirroring suicide victims in terms of race and estimated income.
   Conclusions: These results indicate that there are two distinct groups of female IPV homicides, and recognizing this distinction may allow for the development of more effective trauma prevention strategies. Homicide-suicides showed a more premeditated pattern while homicide alone suggested a crime of passion, with a smaller proportion of firearm deaths and higher rates of positive toxicology findings and preceding conflict in the latter group.

AB We used administrative data to examine predictors of medically documented suicide ideation (SI) among Regular Army soldiers from 2006 through 2009 (N=10,466 ideators, 124,959 control person-months). Enlisted ideators (97.8% of all cases) were more likely than controls to be female, younger, older when entering service, less educated, never or previously deployed, and have a recent mental health diagnosis. Officer ideators were more likely than controls to be female, younger, younger when entering service, never married, and have a recent mental health diagnosis. Risk among enlisted soldiers peaked in the second month of service and declined steadily, whereas risk among officers remained relatively stable over time. Risk of SI is highest among enlisted soldiers early in Army service, females, and those with a recent mental health diagnosis.

AB Purpose: The aim of this paper is to investigate the association between suicide and Lyme and associated diseases ( LAD). No journal article has previously performed a comprehensive assessment of this subject.
   Introduction: Multiple case reports and other references demonstrate a causal association between suicidal risk and LAD. Suicide risk is greater in outdoor workers and veterans, both with greater LAD exposure. Multiple studies demonstrate many infections and the associated proinflammatory cytokines, inflammatory-mediated metabolic changes, and quinolinic acid and glutamate changes alter neural circuits which increase suicidality. A similar pathophysiology occurs in LAD.
   Method: A retrospective chart review and epidemiological calculations were performed.
   Results: LAD contributed to suicidality, and sometimes homicidality, in individuals who were not suicidal before infection. A higher level of risk to self and others is associated with multiple symptoms developing after acquiring LAD, in particular, explosive anger, intrusive images, sudden mood swings, paranoia, dissociative episodes, hallucinations, disinhibition, panic disorder, rapid cycling bipolar, depersonalization, social anxiety disorder, substance abuse, hypervigilance, generalized anxiety disorder, genital-urinary symptoms, chronic pain, anhedonia, depression, low frustration tolerance, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Negative attitudes about LAD from family, friends, doctors, and the health care system may also contribute to suicide risk. By indirect calculations, it is estimated there are possibly over 1,200 LAD suicides in the US per year.
   Conclusion: Suicidality seen in LAD contributes to causing a significant number of previously unexplained suicides and is associated with immune-mediated and metabolic changes resulting in psychiatric and other symptoms which are possibly intensified by negative attitudes about LAD from others. Some LAD suicides are associated with being overwhelmed by multiple debilitating symptoms, and others are impulsive, bizarre, and unpredictable. Greater understanding and a direct method of acquiring LAD suicide statistics is needed. It is suggested that medical examiners, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other epidemiological organizations proactively evaluate the association between LAD and suicide.

AB This article investigates whether the 9/11 attacks affected the assimilation rate of Muslims in the US. Terror attacks by Islamic groups are likely to induce a backlash against Muslims, thereby raising their costs of assimilation. We find that Muslim immigrants living in states with the sharpest increase in hate crimes also exhibit: greater chances of marrying within their own ethnic group; higher fertility; lower female labour force participation; and lower English proficiency. These findings shed light on the increasing use of terror and concurrent rise in social tensions surrounding Muslim immigrants in the West.

AB Objective To evaluate the incidence and outcomes from intentional suspected-suicide self-poisoning in children and young adults ages 10-24 years old from 2000 to 2018.
   Study design Retrospective review of intentional suspected-suicide self-poisoning cases reported to the National Poison Data System from US poison centers from 2000 to 2018 for patients 10-24 years old. For comparison of annual rates, population data by year of age were obtained from the US Census Bureau. We evaluated changes in the annual incidence, the annual rate per 100 000 population, and the medical outcome by patient age and sex.
   Results There were 1 627 825 intentional suspected-suicide self-poisoning cases, of which 1 162 147 (71%) were female. In children 10-15 years old from 2000 to 2010, there was a decrease in number and rate per 100 000 population followed by a significant increase (from 125% to 299%) from 2011 to 2018. In children 10-18 years old, the increase from 2011 to 2018 was driven predominantly by females. In 19-24 years old age groups, there was a temporal delay and reduced increase in slope compared with the younger groups. There were 340 563 moderate outcomes, 45 857 major outcomes, and 1404 deaths. The percentage of cases with a serious outcome, major effect, or death increased over time and with age.
   Conclusions The incidence and rate of suicide attempts using self-poisoning in children less than 19 years old increased significantly after 2011, occurring predominantly in young girls. There has been an increase in the severity of outcomes independent of age or sex.

AB This paper addresses current developments in the right-to-die arena. While discussion of this area has traditionally been the province of disciplines other than sociology, including philosophy and bioethics, this paper offers an alternative framework from which to consider the progressive interest in control and choice at life's end which has developed this century, principally in the Western world. Taking a largely socio-historical approach, this paper argues that issues such as euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide can be seen as forming part of an international social movement, which is dubbed 'the requested death movement'.
   The paper traces the chronology of the movement, placing its framing activities, the emergence of individual activists and events and its progressive mobilization, within a consideration of so-called 'new' social movements, which have emerged since the 1960s. These are principally concerned with resisting state control of cultural matters, while reclaiming matters of identity, privacy and individual corporeality, which it is argued are at the core of the requested death movement. It is posited that this consideration can contribute to understandings of both the contemporary social organization of death and dying, and social movement theory more generally.

AB Fatal and nonfatal injuries due to suicidal behavior among younger adolescents are of growing concern for many communities. We examined the incidence and patterns of these injuries among persons aged 10-14 years using three databases, two national and a third from Oregon. Suffocation and firearm gunshot were the leading external causes of suicide; poisoning and cutting/piercing were the leading causes of nonfatal self-harm injuries. The most common psychosocial factors associated with those treated in emergency departments for self-harm injuries were psychological conditions; drug/alcohol involvement; and adverse circumstances, including family discord, school problems, and physical/sexual abuse. Analysis of population-based data from these databases are part of the public health approach and can help direct much needed research and prevention efforts that address self-harming behavior in these younger adolescents.

AB Relations of the state-aggregated Big Five personality scores of 619,397 residents to four 2005 state-level residential mobility criteria were examined with the 50 states as cases. Multiple regression controlling for five state demographic variables showed (a) higher state neuroticism was strongly associated with lower mobility, lower same-county mobility, and lower between-county mobility; (b) higher state extraversion was associated with lower mobility and lower same-county mobility, but only with neuroticism and/or conscientiousness controlled; and (c) conscientiousness was related to same-residence, same-county, and different-county mobility, but only without demographic variables controlled. Discussion is grounded in the dangers of cross-level speculation and the potential of a basic assumption of geographical psychology that an area's aggregate position on a dispositional variable is associated there with behavioral and psychological tendencies related to that variable.

AB We investigated the association between excessive video game/Internet use and teen suicidality. Data were obtained from the 2007 and 2009 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), a high school-based, nationally representative survey (N = 14,041 and N = 16,410, respectively). Teens who reported 5 hours or more of video games/Internet daily use, in the 2009 YRBS, had a significantly higher risk for sadness (adjusted and weighted odds ratio, 95% confidence interval = 2.1, 1.7-2.5), suicidal ideation (1.7, 1.3-2.1), and suicide planning (1.5, 1.1-1.9). The same pattern was found in the 2007 survey. These findings support an association between excessive video game and Internet use and risk for teen depression and suicidality.

AB BACKGROUND To describe the demographic characteristics and burden of pediatric suicides by firearm in the United States using a large all-payer pediatric inpatient care database. METHODS Children and young adults (<21 years old) were identified with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis of suicide and self-inflicted injury with a firearm (SIF) in the Kids' Inpatient Database for the study years of 2006, 2009, and 2012. National estimates were obtained using case weighting. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to examine the association between SIF and risk factors while adjusting for various sociodemographic characteristics using separate models incorporating mental health diagnoses. RESULTS There were a total of 613 hospitalizations for SIF during the years under study. Almost four hospitalizations per week occurred, and in-hospital mortality was 39.1%. The mean age of the study population was 17.3 years, and this population was predominantly male (87.5%), white (62.4%), resided in an urban area (43.8%), lived in the south (51.3%), and within the lowest income quartile (33.8%). Mental health (38.3%) and mood disorders (28.3%) were common. Males had a markedly increased likelihood of hospitalization for SIF (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 7.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.54-10.30). Children and adolescents from rural environments and those in the south were more likely to have a hospitalization for SIF than respective comparison groups. Using separate regression models, a diagnosis of any mental health disorder increased the likelihood of hospitalization for a SIF (aOR, 11.9: 95% CI, 9.51-14.9), mood disorders (aOR, 17.2; 95% CI, 13.3-22.3), and depression (aOR, 21.3; 95% CI, 16.1-28.3). CONCLUSION Pediatric hospitalizations for SIF are a common occurrence with high associated mortality. The prevalence of mental health disorders and their impact on this population highlight the need for early identification and intervention for individuals at risk.

AB American Indian youth have the highest suicide rates in the United States; however, many do not use services and access barriers exist. This study was a cross-sectional evaluation of 6 gatekeeper trainings conducted on 1 reservation with N=84 individuals. Analyses examined participant characteristics, impact on training objectives, and satisfaction. The majority of participants were American Indian and female (89.3%). Significant increases in knowledge (p<0.001) and self-efficacy (p<0.001) were observed post-test, as well as high satisfaction (3.53/5) and intent to use skills daily (36.4%) or monthly (66.3%). Lowest rated was how the training addressed cultural differences (2.93). While results support the promise of gatekeeper training, they identify a clear need for adaptation; specific implementation and research recommendations are discussed.

AB It is believed that the rate of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) among high school students is increasing. However, no known research has examined the rates of NSSI among non-clinical, high school samples of adolescents across several years. The current study utilized archival data from five academic years [2001 to 2005 (N = 1393)] to address this limitation by examining the lifetime prevalence rates of NSSI in urban high school students within the Midwestern United States. Results indicate a significant difference in rates across years by gender. Females showed a significant increase in their rates of NSSI compared to males, who showed a significant decline, during the last 3 years of the study. Implications of these findings for school personnel and directions for future research discussed.

AB Objective: College students have been the focus of many studies on suicidal ideation with or without suicidal behavior. Little attention has been given to their non-collegeattending peers on these issues. We examined the 12-month prevalence and mental health treatment of suicidal ideation with or without suicidal behavior among college students aged 18-25 years and their non-college-attending peers in the United States.
   Methods: We assessed data from 135,300 persons aged 18-25 years who participated in the 2008-2013 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. Descriptive analyses and multivariate logistic regression models were applied.
   Results: Compared with full-time college students, high school students, those not enrolled in a school or college, and part-time college students were more likely to attempt suicide with a plan (model-adjusted prevalence = 0.67% vs 1.09%, 1.06%, and 1.07%, respectively). The mental health treatment rate among full-time college students with suicidal ideation with or without suicidal behavior was similar to the rates among the other 3 counterparts. The effects of race/ethnicity and serious mental illness on receipt of mental health treatment were significantly larger among those who did not perceive unmet treatment need than among those who perceived unmet treatment need (P = .019 and P = .001, respectively).
   Conclusions: Compared to full-time college students, non-college-attending young adults and part-time college students were at higher risk for attempting suicide with a plan. Suicide prevention and intervention strategies should emphasize increasing access to mental health treatment among both college students with suicidal ideation with or without suicidal behavior and their non-college-attending peers (particularly among minorities and those who seem to be at low risk because they are without serious mental illness and report no need for mental health treatment).

AB This paper presents cost-outcome analyses of five injury prevention efforts in Native American jurisdictions: a safety-belt program, a streetlight project, a livestock control project, a drowning prevention program, and a suicide prevention and intervention program. Pre- and post-intervention data were analyzed to estimate projects' impact on injury reduction. Projects' costs were amortized over the time period covered by the evaluation or over the useful life of physical capital invested. Projects' savings were calculated based on estimated reduction in medical and public program expenses, on estimated decrease in lost productivity, and on estimated quality adjusted life years saved.
   All projects yielded positive benefit-cost ratios. The net cost per quality adjusted life years was less than zero (i.e. the monetary savings exceeded project costs) for all but one of the projects. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There are a number of alternate ways to score the Suicide Opinion Questionnaire (SOQ). Two methods were compared in this study, a set of eight scales developed by content analysis, and a set of five scales developed by factor analysis; two samples, one from the United States (N = 218), and one from Taiwan (N = 291) were assessed. On all SOQ scales, significant mean differences were obtained between U.S. and Taiwanese samples. The patterns of intercorrelations suggest that despite their factor analytic genesis, several of the SOQ-F scales correlate significantly with each other as well as with the SOQ-C scales. The results support the cross-cultural applicability and reliability of the SOQ, and suggest that although the SOQ-F scales may represent interesting variables, they are not superior psychometrically to the original content scales.

TI Strange Notes from the LA Punk Underground: The Durability of Darby
   Crash and the Germs
SO CANADIAN REVIEW OF AMERICAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
DE punk rock; Los Angeles; authenticity; queerness; celebrity
AB This essay examines the durability of Darby Crash, lead singer of the Germs, one of Los Angeles's earliest punk bands. Crash committed suicide in 1980, but he and the Germs continue to fascinate those familiar with their music and story. This ongoing interest is the result of numerous factors, including the Germs' music, Crash's disturbing worldview and charisma, and our more general obsession with celebrity and death. After offering a brief account of Crash's life and his involvement with the Germs, I discuss his largely closeted queerness, one of the apparent reasons behind his suicide; I consider the idea of authenticity and its importance in the ideology of rock and punk. Then, I contextualize Crash in the culture of the United States and Los Angeles in the late 1970s.

AB Youth violence is widely recognized as a major public health problem. Adolescent suicidality (ideation, behavior, or both) is disturbingly common in the United States, and homicide remains one of the leading causes of death for young people aged 10 to 24 years. Assessing youth suicidality and homicidality in the emergency department (ED) is a complex and challenging task. Evidence about the value of available ED risk assessments is not encouraging. Attempts to develop models that predict violence have in part been unsuccessful from the fact that ideation is common and the value of depression is hard to determine. The current study presents an empirically based assessment (adolescent and child urgent threat evaluation) and algorithm (violence ideation and suicidality treatment algorithm) evaluating the impact of ideation and nonideation states on attempt among clinical samples, such as serotonin reuptake inhibitor akathisia and acute adjustment disorders. The authors suggest important time-related factors and easy-to-administer procedures when assessing near-future youth violence. A validated suicide-homicide final common pathway model is discussed.

AB In many Japanese universities, teachers of English often have a difficult time getting students to take sides on an issue. Note this is not a criticism of the students, but it is simply an aspect of Japanese culture that seeks to strive for group harmony and avoid standing out. Some issues, however require thought and debate as they potentially have a profound effect on human life.
   In November 2012, elections were held in the United States. Within the national elections were state elections and initiatives. In Massachussets, two of the issues were legalizing medical marijuana and legalizing assisted suicide. Two classes were given a choice of topic, two others were given just assisted suicide. Three of the 4 classes were medically oriented classes, one was a general Spoken Interaction class. All of the classes were low to low intermediate level.
   The essays and discussions were far superior to the usual essays and discussions in terms of quality of thought and opinions. The presenter will describe the processes of the lessons, discussions and writing. The hope is that this kind of engagement can be continued and expanded.

AB The rise in suicide by African Americans in the United States is directly attributable to the dramatic, nearly three-fold increase in suicide rates of African American males. Gibbs (1997) hypothesized high social support, religiosity, and southern residence are protective factors against suicidality for Black people. This hypothesis was tested among 5,125 participants from the National Comorbidity Survey; 299 were African American males. In this study we hypothesized that there would be significantly lower suicidality in the South, and social support and religiosity would mediate this relationship. Our results indicate that Southern region is indeed a significant predictor of suicidal symptoms in African American men, such that suicidal symptoms were lower in the South, but religiosity and social support did not account for this effect. Other potential mediators were also examined.

AB Remarkably little systematic research has studied the effects of clinical suicidology training on changing practitioner attitudes and behaviors. In the current study we investigated whether training in an empirically-based assessment and treatment approach to suicidal patients administered through a continuing education workshop could meaningfully impact professional practices, clinic policy, clinician confidence, and beliefs posttraining and 6 months later. At the 6 month follow-up we found that 44% of practitioners reported increased confidence in assessing suicide risk, 54% reported increased confidence in managing suicidal patients, 83% reported changing suicide care practices, and 66% reported changing clinic policy. These results suggest that a brief and carefully developed workshop training experience can potentially change provider perceptions and behaviors with a possible impact on clinical care therein,

AB Suicide is a very serious problem. In the United states it ranks as the second most frequent cause of death among teenagers between the ages of 12 and 17. In this work, we investigate speech characteristics of prosody as well as voice quality in a dyadic interview corpus with suicidal and non-suicidal adolescents. In these interviews the adolescents answer specifically designed questions. Based on this limited dataset, we reveal statistically significant differences in the speech patterns of suicidal adolescents within the investigated interview corpus. Further, we investigate the classification capabilities of machine learning approaches both on an utterance as well as an interview level. The work shows promising results in a speaker-independent classification experiment based on only a dozen speech features. We believe that once the algorithms are refined and integrated with other methods, they may be of value to the clinician.

SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS

DT Article
DE physician-assisted suicide; voluntary euthanasia; patient autonomy;
   religious belief
ID PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE; ATTITUDES
AB In Australia and Oregon, USA, legislation to permit statutory sanctioned physician-assisted dying was enacted. However, opponents, many of whom held strong religious views, were successful with repeal in Australia. Similar opposition in Oregon was formidable, but ultimately lost in a 60-40% vote reaffirming physician-assisted dying. This paper examines the human dilemma which arises when technological advances in end-of-life medicine conflict with traditional and religious sanctity-of-life values. Society places high value on personal autonomy, particularly in the United States. We compare the potential for inherent contradictions and arbitrary decisions where patient autonomy is either permitted or forbidden. The broader implications for human experience resulting from new legislation in both Australia and Oregon are discussed. We conclude that allowing autonomy for the terminally ill, within circumscribed options,results in fewer ethical contradictions and greater preservation of dignity.

SO ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN THORACIC SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
DE carbon monoxide; poisoning; epidemiology; suicide; prevention
ID UNITED-STATES; EXPOSURES; EMISSION
AB Rationale: Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning accounts for hundreds of deaths and thousands of emergency department visits in the United States annually. Development of initiatives to reduce CO mortality through poisoning prevention requires a comprehensive understanding of the condition. Objectives: To describe U.S. mortality from 1999 to 2014 due to CO poisoning from all sources except fires, to examine the epidemiology of accidental and intentional exposures, and to identify trends.
   Methods: The CDC WONDER database was used to extract and analyze data from the CDC's Multiple Cause of Death 1999-2014 file. The file contains mortality data derived from all death certificates filed in the United States.
   Measurements and Main Results: Information on deaths, crude death rate, age-adjusted death rate, intent of exposure, and characteristics of exposures from CO poisoning was extracted. Total deaths by CO poisoning decreased from 1,967 in 1999 to 1,319 in 2014 (P < 0.001). Crude and adjusted death rates fell accordingly. Accidental poisoning accounted for 13% fewer deaths per year in 2014 than in 1999 (P <0.001). The number of intentional deaths by CO poisoning decreased by 47% over the same period (P, 0.001). The rate of decline in combined adjusted death rates from 1999 to 2014 in the 19 states that required residential CO alarms by 2010 was not different from that for the 31 states that did not require residential alarms (P = 0.982).
   Conclusions: Numbers of deaths and death rates, both accidental and intentional, due to CO poisoning significantly declined in the United States from 1999 to 2014. Continued public education about CO toxicity should be emphasized. Additional study is needed to demonstrate the efficacy of residential CO alarms.

AB The association between home firearms and the likelihood and nature of suicidal thoughts and plans was examined using the Second Injury Control and Risk Survey, a 2001-2003 representative telephone survey of U. S. households. Of 9,483 respondents, 7.4% reported past-year suicidal thoughts, 21.3% with a plan. Similar proportions of those with and without a home firearm reported suicidal thoughts, plans, and attempts. Among respondents with suicidal plans, the odds of reporting a plan involving a firearm were over seven times greater among those with firearms at home, compared with those without firearms at home. The results suggest people with home firearms may not be more likely to be suicidal, but when suicidal they may be more likely to plan suicide by firearm.

AB Substance use and mental health disorders can result in disability, death, and economic cost. In the United States, rates of death from suicide, drug overdose, and chronic liver disease (a marker for alcohol abuse) have been rising for the past 15 years. Good public health surveillance for these disorders, their consequences, and their risk factors is crucially important for their prevention and control, but surveillance has not been conducted consistently in the states. In 2015, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists convened a workgroup to develop a set of uniformly defined surveillance indicators that could be used by state and local health departments to monitor these disorders and to compare their occurrence in various jurisdictions. This report briefly describes the indicators and outlines the process used to develop them.

Although palliative care is very effective, physicians, nurses, patients, families, and loved ones regularly face clinically, ethically, legally, and morally challenging decisions throughout the dying process. This is especially true when terminally ill patients are ready to die in the face of complex, difficult-to-treat suffering and request assistance from their health care providers. Although physician-assisted suicide has received the most attention as a potential last-resort response, this practice remains illegal in the United States except in Oregon, and even there it is relatively infrequent. More commonly, decisions are made about accelerating opioid therapy for pain, forgoing life-sustaining therapy, voluntarily stopping eating and drinking, and administering terminal sedation in response to unacceptable suffering. The moral distinctions between these practices are critical to some but relatively inconsequential to others. This paper illustrates, through summaries of real clinical cases, how each of these practices might be used in response to patients in particular clinical circumstances, keeping in focus the patient's values as well as those of families, other loved ones, and health care providers. The challenge is to find the least harmful solution to the patient's problem without abandoning patients and their loved ones to unacceptable suffering or to acting in a more deleterious way on their own.

AB Aims. Low and middle income countries share a heavy burden of suicide with about three in every four suicides occurring in these countries. Mexico has witnessed a growing trend in suicide deaths; if this trend is not simply a reflection of better reporting of suicide on death certificates, then this increase should logically be accompanied by an increasing trend in suicide ideation, plan and attempts, but we lack information on the trends for suicide ideation, plan and attempt for this period. We therefore aim to report changes for suicidal behaviour for the period 2001-2013 in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area.
   Method. Using two cross-sectional surveys conducted in Mexico in 2001 and 2013, we report the lifetime and 12-month prevalence of suicide ideation, plan and attempt and changes in treatment for these problems among respondents aged 19-26 living in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area 12 years apart. To estimate the changes in prevalence for each outcome, we used generalised linear models to calculate prevalence ratios (PR; the prevalence rate in the exposed (year 2013) divided by the prevalence rate in the unexposed (year 2001-2002), adjusting for sociodemographic variables.
   Results. While increases in the prevalence are noted everywhere, statistical comparisons only found differences for lifetime ideation (PR = 3.1; 95% CI = 1.7-5.8) and a borderline difference for suicide attempt (PR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.0-4.9). No attempt within the last 12-months was reported in 2001, but the prevalence in 2013 reached 1.5% (18 cases). While PRs for 12-month prevalence were all above the null, none reached statistically significant differences. During this 12-year period, the distribution of mental disorders and the use of services for mental disorders among suicide ideators, planners and attempters did not change in any noticeable way.
   Conclusions. The limitations of our data are the small number of participants in the 2001 survey, the low follow-up rate for the survey in 2013 and that while representative from one city it does not represent the whole country. These findings suggest that suicide ideation and attempt may have increased during this 12-year period in the Mexico City metropolitan area, but this increase did not lead to more use of mental health care services. This information, coupled with the long-term trend of increasing suicide death rates in the country, draw a worrisome and neglected scenario for our youth in this region. Urgent measures, following the recent WHO guidelines for suicide prevention, must not be postponed.

AB Background: In the United States, adolescent suicide attempts are increasing. Indiana has the highest rate of adolescent suicidal ideation in the US. Using the National Poison Data System (NPDS), we analyzed Indiana's increase in suicide attempts by poisoning. Methods: Utilizing NPDS and Toxicall data repositories, we selected 10-19 year-old intentional overdose cases with suspected suicidal intent from 2006-2016. Age, sex, outcome, involved substances and case volume by weekday and month were assessed. Geospatial analysis of the proportion of cases by county was also performed. To determine the association between known social determinants of health and adolescent intentional overdose cases with suspected suicidal intent, we correlated county-wide statistics from the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps dataset from 2010-2016 with the proportion of teen suicide cases by county. Results: Over the eleven years, adolescent intentional overdoses with suspected suicidal intent cases significantly increased starting in 2012 (p-value < .001). The majority of cases (73.7%) involved females with an average age of 15.96 +/- 0.27 years. Monday and Tuesday had the highest rates and Saturday had the lowest. June and July had the lowest case rate while November had the highest. The most commonly involved agents were over-the-counter analgesics and antidepressants. Geospatial analysis shows an increased number of cases in the northern third of the State. Among county statistics analyzed, only violent crime was associated, albeit intermittently, with the 11-year proportion of adolescent intentional overdoses with suspected suicidal intent by county. Conclusions: Intentional overdoses with suspected suicidal intent involving adolescent females are significantly increasing. These rates correlate with the school schedule with summer months and weekends having a lower frequency of calls. We did not find associations between county wide social determinants of care with the exception of violent crime. Further studies are needed to establish the factors that might better predict adolescents at risk for suicide.

ID BULLIES; VICTIMS
AB Context Despite the public alarm following a series of high-profile school shootings that occurred in the United States during the late 1990s, little is known about the actual incidence and characteristics of school-associated violent deaths.
   Objective To describe recent trends and features of school-associated violent deaths in the United States.
   Design, Setting, and Subjects Population-based surveillance study of data collected from media databases, state and local agencies, and police and school officials for July 1, 1994, through June 30, 1999. A case was defined as a homicide, suicide, legal intervention, or unintentional firearm-related death of a student or nonstudent in which the fatal injury occurred (1) on the campus of a public or private elementary or secondary school, (2) while the victim was on the way to or from such a school, or (3) while the victim was attending or traveling to or from an official school-sponsored event.
   Main Outcome Measures National estimates of risk of school-associated violent death; national trends in school-associated violent deaths; common features of these events; and potential risk factors for perpetration and victimization.
   Results Between 1994 and 1999, 220 events resulting in 253 deaths were identified; 202 events involved 1 death and 18 involved multiple deaths (median, 2 deaths per multiple-victim event). Of the 220 events, 172 were homicides, 30 were suicides, 11 were homicide-suicides, 5 were legal intervention deaths, and 2 were unintentional firearm-related deaths. Students accounted for 172 (68.0%) of these deaths, resulting in an estimated average annual incidence of 0.068 per 100000 students. Between 1992 and 1999, the rate of single-victim student homicides decreased-significantly (P=.03); however, homicide rates for students killed in multiple-victim events increased (P=.047). Most events occurred around the start of the school day, the lunch period, or the end of the school day. For 120 (54.5%) of the incidents, respondents reported that a note, threat, or other action potentially indicating risk for violence occurred prior to the event. Homicide offenders were more likely than homicide victims to have expressed some form of suicidal behavior prior to the event (odds ratio [OR], 6.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.96-24.65) and been bullied by their peers (OR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.12-5.92).
   Conclusions Although school-associated violent deaths remain rare events, they have occurred often enough to allow for the detection of patterns and the identification of potential risk factors. This information may help schools respond to this problem.

AB Objectives: Belief in lunar effects on abnormal or deviant human behavior ("moon madness") is old, common, perpetuated by the media and notably widespread among health professionals, and may thus have public health consequences. This study investigated lunar effects on one particular outcome (completed suicide) for which the literature appears unsettled, owing to some recent reports with positive findings.
   Methods: The timing of all 65,206 suicides (46,451 men; 18,755 women) officially registered in Austria between 1970 and 2006 was analyzed with respect to the phases of the moon. This was the first such study based on national data conducted outside the USA, with the database comprising the second-longest study period and the second-largest sample ever investigated in this subject area.
   Results: Observed proportions of both male and female suicide occurrence did not deviate from expected proportions during the new, crescent, full, and decrescent moon quarters or from those expected for 3-day windows centered around new and full moon, relative to the interphase. Subgroup analysis (by sex and year), additionally conducted for demonstration purposes, yielded results conspicuously resembling those of related studies with positive findings; namely, sporadically emerging significant findings that were entirely absent in the overall analysis and directionally erratic, thus suggesting they were spurious (false positive).
   Conclusions: This large-sample evidence strongly suggests no lunar effects on the timing of completed suicide. Scattered previous evidence in support of such effects in all likelihood was spurious; that is, was due to statistical type 1 errors or erroneously taking calendrical periodicities of suicide occurrence that are real as evidence for lunar effects.

AB Purpose The study aims to develop and validate algorithms to identify and classify opioid overdoses using claims and other coded data, and clinical text extracted from electronic health records using natural language processing (NLP). Methods Primary data were derived from Kaiser Permanente Northwest (2008-2014), an integrated health care system (similar to n > 475 000 unique individuals per year). Data included International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes for nonfatal diagnoses, International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes for fatal events, clinical notes, and prescription medication records. We assessed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for algorithms relative to medical chart review and conducted assessments of algorithm portability in Kaiser Permanente Washington, Tennessee State Medicaid, and Optum. Results Code-based algorithm performance was excellent for opioid-related overdoses (sensitivity = 97.2%, specificity = 84.6%) and classification of heroin-involved overdoses (sensitivity = 91.8%, specificity = 99.0%). Performance was acceptable for code-based suicide/suicide attempt classifications (sensitivity = 70.7%, specificity = 90.5%); sensitivity improved with NLP (sensitivity = 78.7%, specificity = 91.0%). Performance was acceptable for the code-based substance abuse-involved classification (sensitivity = 75.3%, specificity = 79.5%); sensitivity improved with the NLP-enhanced algorithm (sensitivity = 80.5%, specificity = 76.3%). The opioid-related overdose algorithm performed well across portability assessment sites, with sensitivity greater than 96% and specificity greater than 84%. Cross-site sensitivity for heroin-involved overdose was greater than 87%, specificity greater than or equal to 99%. Conclusions Code-based algorithms developed to detect opioid-related overdoses and classify them according to heroin involvement perform well. Algorithms for classifying suicides/attempts and abuse-related opioid overdoses perform adequately for use for research, particularly given the complexity of classifying such overdoses. The NLP-enhanced algorithms for suicides/suicide attempts and abuse-related overdoses perform significantly better than code-based algorithms and are appropriate for use in settings that have data and capacity to use NLP.

AB Problem/Condition: An estimated 55,000 persons die annually in the United States as a result of violence-related injuries. This report summarizes data from CDC's National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) regarding violent deaths from 16 U. S. states for 2010. Results are reported by sex, age group, race/ethnicity, marital status, location of injury, method of injury, circumstances of injury, and other selected characteristics.
   Reporting Period Covered: 2010.
   Description of System: NVDRS collects data regarding violent deaths obtained from death certificates, coroner/medical examiner reports, law enforcement reports, and secondary sources (e. g., child fatality review team data, supplementary homicide reports, hospital data, and crime laboratory data). NVDRS data collection began in 2003 with seven states (Alaska, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, South Carolina, and Virginia) participating; six states (Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin) joined in 2004, four (California, Kentucky, New Mexico, and Utah) in 2005, and two in 2010 (Ohio and Michigan), for a total of 19 states. This report includes data from 16 states that collected statewide data in 2010; data from California are not included in this report because data were not collected after 2009. Ohio and Michigan were excluded because data collection, which began in 2010, did not occur statewide until 2011.
   Results: For 2010, a total of 15,781 fatal incidents involving 16,186 deaths were captured by NVDRS in the 16 states included in this report. The majority (62.8%) of deaths were suicides, followed by homicides and deaths involving legal intervention (i.e., deaths caused by law enforcement and other persons with legal authority to use deadly force, excluding legal executions) (24.4%), deaths of undetermined intent (12.2%), and unintentional firearm deaths (0.7%). Suicides occurred at higher rates among males, non-Hispanic whites, American Indians/Alaska Natives, and persons aged 45-54 years. Suicides most often occurred in a house or apartment and involved the use of firearms. Suicides were preceded primarily by a mental health or intimate partner problem, a crisis during the previous 2 weeks, or a physical health problem. Homicides occurred at higher rates among males and persons aged 20-24 years; rates were highest among non-Hispanic black males. The majority of homicides involved the use of a firearm and occurred in a house or apartment or on a street/highway. Homicides were precipitated primarily by arguments and interpersonal conflicts or in conjunction with another crime.
   Interpretation: This report provides a detailed summary of data from NVDRS for 2010. The results indicate that violent deaths resulting from self-inflicted or interpersonal violence disproportionately affected persons aged < 55 years, males, and certain minority populations. For homicides and suicides, relationship problems, interpersonal conflicts, mental health problems, and recent crises were among the primary precipitating factors. Because additional information might be reported subsequently as participating states update their findings, the data provided in this report are preliminary.
   Public Health Action: For the occurrence of violent deaths in the United States to be better understood and ultimately prevented, accurate, timely, and comprehensive surveillance data are necessary. NVDRS data can be used to monitor the occurrence of violence-related fatal injuries and assist public health authorities in the development, implementation, and evaluation of programs and policies to reduce and prevent violent deaths at the national, state, and local levels. NVDRS data have been used to enhance prevention programs. Examples include use of linked NVDRS data and adult protective service data to better target elder maltreatment prevention programs and improve staff training to identify violent death risks for older adults in North Carolina, use of Oklahoma VDRS homicide data to help evaluate the effectiveness of a new police and advocate intervention at domestic violence incident scenes, and data-informed changes in primary care practice in Oregon to more effectively address older adult suicide prevention. The continued development and expansion of NVDRS is essential to CDC's efforts to reduce the personal, familial, and societal impacts of violence. Further efforts are needed to increase the number of states participating in NVDRS, with an ultimate goal of full national representation.

AB Context. Health care professionals (HCPs) are crucial to physician-assisted death (PAD) provision.
   Objectives. To quantitatively assess the favorability of justifications for or against PAD legalization among HCPs, the effect of the terms ''suicide'' and ''euthanasia'' on their views and their support for three forms of PAD.
   Methods. Our questionnaire presented three cases: physician-assisted suicide, euthanasia for a competent patient, and euthanasia for an incompetent patient with an advance directive for euthanasia. Respondents judged whether each case was ethical and should be legal and selected their justifications from commonly cited reasons. The sample included physician clinicians, researchers, nonphysician clinicians, and other nonclinical staff at a major academic medical center.
   Results. Of 221 HCPs, the majority thought that each case was ethical and should be legal. In order of declining favorability, justifications supporting PAD legalization were relief of suffering, right to die, mercy, acceptance of death, nonabandonment, and saving money for the health care system; opposing justifications were the slippery slope argument, unnecessary due to palliative care, killing patients is wrong, religious views, and suicide is wrong. The use of suicide and euthanasia terminology did not affect responses. Participants preferred physician-assisted suicide to euthanasia for a competent patient (P < 0.0001) and euthanasia for an incompetent patient to euthanasia for a competent patient (P < 0.005).
   Conclusions. HCPs endorsed patient-centered justifications over other reasons, including role-specific duties. Suicide and euthanasia language did not bias HCPs against PAD, challenging claims that such value-laden terms hinder dialogue. More research is required to understand the significance of competency in shaping attitudes toward PAD. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.

AB This prospective cohort study used administrative data from the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers to examine associations between neurocognitive functioning and subsequent suicidal events among Regular Army enlisted soldiers during the years 2004-2009. Cases were all soldiers who completed the Army's Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) computerized testing battery prior to documented suicide attempt (n=607), ideation (n=955), or death (n=57). Controls were an equal-probability sample of 9,893 person-months from other soldiers. Exploratory factor analysis of five ANAM tests identified a general neurocognitive factor that excluded the mathematic processing test (MTH). When examined separately in logistic regression analyses that controlled for sociodemographics and prior mental health diagnosis, both the general neurocognitive factor (logit []=-.197 to -.521; p<.01) and MTH (=-.024 to -.064; p<.05) were associated with all outcomes. When both predictors were examined simultaneously, the general neurocognitive factor continued to be associated with all outcomes (=-.164 to -.417; p<.05) and MTH continued to be associated with suicide attempt (=-.015; p=.046) and ideation (=-.014; p=.018). These small but robust associations suggest that future research must continue to examine the extent to which objective neurocognitive tests may enhance understanding and prediction of suicide risk.

AB Objective:
   The aim of this systematic review was to provide a picture of suicidality (suicide ideation and behavior, both fatal and nonfatal) among indviduals with migraine.
   Background:
   Migraine is a leading cause of disability around the world. Migraine may manifest with a number of symptoms, ranging from severe headaches to neurological sensory disturbances. Comorbid psychological conditions, such as depression, have also been linked to chronic migraine.
   Data Sources:
   Articles were retrieved from SCOPUS, PubMed, Proquest, and Web of Science.
   Search Terms:
   Suicid* AND migrain* in English-language peer-reviewed journals between January 1, 1966 and December 31, 2014.
   Eligibility Criteria:
   Original research papers providing empirical evidence about the potential link between migraine and suicidal behaviors.
   Results:
   Initial search identified 510 papers; the titles and abstracts of 360 unique results were examined for their relevance to the combination of migraine and suicidality. In total, 17 papers reporting original empirical analyses were included in this review.
   Conclusions:
   Research has empirically documented a link between migraine and suicide ideation and behavior, particularly concerning the subtype of migraine with aura. Overall, nonfatal suicidal behavior among people with migraine has primarily been investigated, with only 2 studies analyzing suicide mortality. In addition, majority of studies originated from the United States or Canada (n=10). Future research should thoroughly define migraine and investigate link between migraine and suicide mortality.

ID DEPRESSION
AB Suicide rates are increasing in the United States and groups at elevated risk include older adults, veterans, and those with life-limiting illnesses. However, the treatment of suicidality at end-of-life has been little studied. There is emerging evidence that palliative care itself may be protective against suicide and there is some support for the use of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) at end-of-life. The overlapping mechanisms of palliative care and ACT are especially well-suited for individuals struggling with suicidality in the context of life-limiting illness. A case from a Veterans Affairs Home-Based Primary Care (HBPC) team is used to illustrate the challenges and opportunities when providing end-of-life care to an older veteran with chronic suicidal ideation. Prior mental health treatment had limited impact on his suicidality. However, with an integrated ACT and palliative care approach, the HBPC team was better able to focus on the veteran's goals. This approach was helpful in reducing suicidal ideation and engaging him in end-of-life decision-making discussions. This case highlights the valuable role of palliative care in suicide prevention and how the addition of ACT can aid in the effective treatment of chronic suicidal ideation at the end-of-life.

AB Purpose: To compare rates of external causes of mortality among individuals who served in the military (before and after separation from the military) to the U.S. population.
   Methods: This retrospective cohort study examined all 3.9 million service members who served from 2002 to 2007. External cause mortality data from 2002 to 2009 were used to calculate standardized mortality ratios. Negative binomial regression compared differences in the mortality rates for pre- and post-separation.
   Results: Accident and suicide mortality rates were highest among cohort members under 30 years of age, and most of the accident and suicide rates for these younger individuals exceeded expectation given the U.S. population mortality rates. Military suicide rates began below the expected U.S. rate in 2002 but exceeded the U.S. rate by 2009. Accident, homicide, and undetermined mortality rates remained below the U.S. rates throughout the study period. Mortality rates for all external causes were significantly higher among separated individuals compared with those who did not separate. Mortality rates for individuals after separation from service decreased over time but remained higher than the rates for those who had not separated from service.
   Conclusions: Higher rates of death for all external causes of mortality after separation suggest prevention opportunities. Future research should examine how preseparation characteristics and experiences may predict postseparation adverse outcomes to inform transition programs. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Little is known about the bio-behavioral mechanisms underlying and differentiating suicide attempts from non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) in adolescents. Adolescents who attempt suicide or engage in NSSI often report significant interpersonal and social difficulties. Emotional face recognition ability is a fundamental skill required for successful social interactions, and deficits in this ability may provide insight into the unique brain-behavior interactions underlying suicide attempts versus NSSI in adolescents. Therefore, we examined emotional face recognition ability among three mutually exclusive groups: (1) inpatient adolescents who attempted suicide (SA, n = 30); (2) inpatient adolescents engaged in NSSI (NSSI, n = 30); and (3) typically developing controls (TDC, n = 30) without psychiatric illness. Participants included adolescents aged 13-17 years, matched on age, gender and full-scale IQ. Emotional face recognition was evaluated using the diagnostic assessment of nonverbal accuracy (DANVA-2). Compared to TDC youth, adolescents with NSSI made more errors on child fearful and adult sad face recognition while controlling for psychopathology and medication status (ps < 0.05). No differences were found on emotional face recognition between NSSI and SA groups. Secondary analyses showed that compared to inpatients without major depression, those with major depression made fewer errors on adult sad face recognition even when controlling for group status (p < 0.05). Further, compared to inpatients without generalized anxiety, those with generalized anxiety made fewer recognition errors on adult happy faces even when controlling for group status (p < 0.05). Adolescent inpatients engaged in NSSI showed greater deficits in emotional face recognition than TDC, but not inpatient adolescents who attempted suicide. Further results suggest the importance of psychopathology in emotional face recognition. Replication of these preliminary results and examination of the role of context-dependent emotional processing are needed moving forward.

AB Suicide remains the 10th leading cause of death among adults in the United States (U.S.). Annually, approximately 30 per 100,000 U.S. military Veterans commit suicide, compared to 14 per 100,000 U.S. civilians. Symptoms associated with suicidality can be treatment resistant and proven-effective pharmaceuticals may have adverse side-effects. Thus, a critical need remains to identify effective approaches for building psychological resiliency in at-risk individuals. Omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (n-3 HUFAs) are essential nutrients, which must be consumed in the diet. N-3 HUFAs have been demonstrated to reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety, and impulsivity which are associated with suicide risk. Here we present the design and methods for the Better Resiliency Among Veterans and non-Veterans with Omega-3's (BRAVO) study, which is a double blind, randomized, controlled trial among individuals at risk of suicide of an n-3 HUFA versus placebo supplementation in the form of all natural fruit juice beverages. The BRAVO study seeks to determine if dietary supplementation with n-3 HUFAs reduces the risk for serious suicidal behaviors, suicidal thinking, negative emotions, and symptoms associated with suicide risk. Sub-analyses will evaluate efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms, alcohol, and nicotine use. A sub-study utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging (JMRI) to evaluate the neuropsychological and neurophysiological effects of n-3 HUFAs. We also outline selection of appropriate proxy outcome measures for detecting response to treatment and collection of ancillary data, such as diet and substance use, that are critical for interpretation of results.

AB Cultural perspectives on suicidality have been largely marked by work explaining variability in suicide acceptability in the United States using structural variables including marital status and demographics, and limited symbolic or values orientations such as feminism, political liberalism, and civil liberties. The present article applies recent developments in comparative cultural sociology to the problem of suicidality. The central hypothesis is that cultural approval of suicide is related to a general cultural axis of nations (self-expressionism) encompassing several values orientations such as tolerance and post-materialism. Data are from Wave 4 of the World Values Surveys and refer to 53,275 individuals nested in 56 nations. Controls are incorporated from previous studies and include structural and demographic constructs. A hierarchical linear regression model determined that the degree of individual-level adherence to the values of self-expressionism predicted suicide acceptability (SA), independent of controls including ones interpretable from Durkheimian perspectives. Furthermore, persons high in individual-level self-expressionism nested in like-minded nations were relatively high in SA. The analysis of the subject is expanded to 56 nations representing all major culture zones and varied levels of economic/political development. It determined that SA is shaped by a new, broad cultural construct, self-expressionism whose impact is independent of Durkheimian familial and religious integration.

AB IMPORTANCE Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurologic disorder that has been previously found to be associated with higher odds of suicidal ideation. In the context of the increasing suicide rate in the United States, the evidence regarding the association between RLS and the risk of suicide and self-harm is limited.
   OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between RLS and risk of suicide and self-harm.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study was performed using Truven Health MarketScan national claims data from 2006 to 2014; the baseline data were from 2006 to 2008, and the follow-up data covered 6 years (January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2014). Included were 24 179 nonpregnant participants with RLS and 145 194 age- and sex-matched participants without RLS at baseline (2006-2008), who were free of suicide, self-harm, cardiovascular disease, or cancer at study baseline. Data analysis was performed from February 1, 2018, to January 1, 2019.
   EXPOSURE Diagnosis of RLS, as identified by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incident suicide and self-harm event, identified by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis code.
   RESULTS Among 169 373 participants in the current analysis, the mean (SD) age was 49.4 (9.1) years; 53 426 (31.5%) participants were men. During a mean (SD) follow-up duration of 5.2 (2.2) years, 119 incident suicide and self-harm cases were identified. Individuals with RLS had a higher risk of suicide or self-harm compared with those without RLS (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.70-4.15), after adjusting for lifestyle factors (eg, alcohol and obesity), presence of chronic diseases (eg, depression, insomnia, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, peripheral neuropathy, iron-deficiency anemia, and Parkinson disease), and use of medications. Excluding those with depression, insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, and other common chronic conditions, the significant association between RLS and suicide or self-harm persisted (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.14; 95% CI, 2.17-7.92).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Restless legs syndrome was associated with a high risk of suicide and self-harm, and the risk was independent of most identified diseases and conditions.

AB Purpose: Victims of bullying are susceptible to a variety of detrimental consequences. It remains unclear, however, whether the type of bullying victimization and the gender of the victim matter as they relate to two mental health consequences: (1) depression, and (2) suicide ideation.
   Methods: We examined the effects of the bullying victimization experiences of 1,874 adolescents. Controlling for known predictors of maladaptive mental health, we assessed whether any bullying victimization and any type of bullying victimizations were associated with depression and suicide ideation. Each of these relationships was also compared across gender.
   Results: Reported victimization rates varied across three types of bullying. Experiencing any type of bullying victimization corresponded with higher levels of depression and suicide ideation for females and males. Females and males who were verbally bullied experienced higher rates of depression than those who were not bullied. Female cyber bully victims experienced higher levels of depression compared to male cyber bully victims. No significant gender differences in suicide ideation emerged across individuals who experienced any type of bullying.
   Conclusions: Assistance to victims in terms of the development and/or maintenance of their mental health must be mindful of how individuals are being victimized and the gender of the victim. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Problem/Condition: In 2016, approximately 65,000 persons died in the United States as a result of violence-related injuries. This report summarizes data from CDC's National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) regarding violent deaths from 32 U.S. states for 2016. Results are reported by sex, age group, race/ethnicity, type of location where injured, method of injury, circumstances of injury, and other selected characteristics.
   Period Covered: 2016.
   Description of System: NVDRS collects data regarding violent deaths obtained from death certificates, coroner/medical examiner reports, law enforcement reports, and secondary sources (e.g., child fatality review team data, Supplementary Homicide Reports, hospital data, and crime laboratory data). This report includes data collected from 32 states for 2016 (Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin). NVDRS collates information for each death and links deaths that are related (e.g., multiple homicides, homicide followed by suicide, or multiple suicides) into a single incident.
   Results: For 2016, NVDRS captured 40,374 fatal incidents involving 41,466 deaths in the 32 states included in this report. The majority (62.3%) of deaths were suicides, followed by homicides (24.9%), deaths of undetermined intent (10.8%), legal intervention deaths (1.2%) (i.e., deaths caused by law enforcement and other persons with legal authority to use deadly force acting in the line of duty, excluding legal executions), and unintentional firearm deaths (<1.0%). (The term legal intervention is a classification incorporated into the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision [ICD-10] and does not denote the lawfulness or legality of the circumstances surrounding a death caused by law enforcement.) Demographic patterns varied by manner of death. Suicide rates were highest among males, non-Hispanic American Indians/Alaska Natives, non-Hispanic whites, adults aged 45-64 years, and men aged >= 75 years. The most common method of injury was a firearm among males and poisoning among females. Suicides were most often preceded by a mental health, intimate partner, substance abuse, or physical health problem or a recent or impending crisis during the previous or upcoming 2 weeks. Homicide rates were highest among males and persons aged <1 year and 15-44 years. Among males, non-Hispanic blacks accounted for most homicides and had the highest rate of any racial/ethnic group. The most common method of injury was a firearm. Homicides were most often precipitated by an argument or conflict, occurred in conjunction with another crime, or for females, were related to intimate partner violence. When the relationship between a homicide victim and a suspected perpetrator was known, the suspect was most frequently an acquaintance/friend among males and a current or former intimate partner among females. Legal intervention death rates were highest among men aged 20-44 years, and the rate among non-Hispanic black males was three times the rate among non-Hispanic white males. Precipitating circumstances for legal intervention deaths most frequently were an alleged criminal activity in progress, reported use of a weapon by the victim in the incident, a mental health or substance abuse problem (other than alcohol abuse), an argument or conflict, or a recent or impending crisis. Unintentional firearm deaths were more frequent among males, non-Hispanic whites, and persons aged 15-24 years. These deaths most often occurred while the shooter was playing with a firearm and most often were precipitated by a person unintentionally pulling the trigger or mistakenly thinking the firearm was unloaded. Rates of deaths of undetermined intent were highest among males, particularly non-Hispanic black and American Indian/Alaska Native males, and adults aged 25-64 years. Substance abuse, mental health problems, physical health problems, and a recent or impending crisis were the most common circumstances preceding deaths of undetermined intent. In 2016, a total of 3,655 youths aged 10-24 years died by suicide. The majority of these decedents were male, non-Hispanic white, and aged 18-24 years. Most decedents aged 10-17 years died by hanging/strangulation/suffocation (49.3%), followed by a firearm (40.4%), and suicides among this age group were most often precipitated by mental health, family relationship, and school problems. Most suicides among decedents aged 18-24 years were by a firearm (46.2%), followed by hanging/strangulation/suffocation (37.4%), and were precipitated by mental health, substance abuse, intimate partner, and family problems.
   A recent crisis, an argument or conflict, or both were common precipitating circumstances among all youth suicide decedents.
   Interpretation: This report provides a detailed summary of data from NVDRS for 2016. Suicides rates were highest among nonHispanic American Indian/Alaska Native and white males, whereas homicide rates were highest among non-Hispanic black males. Mental health problems, intimate partner problems, interpersonal conflicts, and acute life stressors were primary precipitating events for multiple types of violent deaths, including suicides among youths aged 10-24 years.
   Public Health Action: NVDRS data are used to monitor the occurrence of violence-related fatal injuries and assist public health authorities in the development, implementation, and evaluation of programs and policies to reduce and prevent violent deaths. For example, Utah VDRS data were used to help identify suicide risk factors among youths aged 10-17 years, Rhode Island VDRS suicide data were analyzed to identify precipitating circumstances of youth suicides over a 10-year period, and Kansas VDRS data were used by the Kansas Youth Suicide Prevention Task Force. In 2019, NVDRS expanded data collection to include all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. This expansion is essential to public health efforts to reduce violent deaths.

AB Objective: To examine the associations between personality traits and suicidal ideation (SI) and attempt (SA) in mood disorder patients and community controls.
   Method: We recruited 365 bipolar, 296 major depressive disorder patients, and 315 community controls to assess their lifetime suicidality. Participants filled out self-reported personality questionnaires to collect data of personality traits, including novelty seeking (NS), harm avoidance (HA), extraversion (E), and neuroticism (N). We used logistic regression models adjusted for diagnoses to analyze combinational effects of personality traits on the risk of suicide. Additionally, radar charts display personality profiles for suicidal behaviours by groups.
   Results: All personality traits were associated with the risk of suicidality with various effect size, except for E that showed protective effect. High N or HA had prominent and independent risk effects on SI and SA. Combinations of high N and low E, or high HA and NS were the risk personality profiles for suicidality. Higher N scores further distinguished SA from SI in mood disorder patients.
   Conclusion: Introvert personality traits showed independent risk effects on suicidality regardless of diagnosis status. Among high-risk individuals with suicidal thoughts, higher neuroticism tendency is further associated with increased risk of suicide attempt.

AB Youth suicide is a major public health problem. It is the third leading cause of death in the United States for ages 13 through 18. Many adolescents that face suicidal thoughts or make a suicide plan never seek professional care or help. Within this work, we evaluate both verbal and nonverbal responses to a five-item ubiquitous questionnaire to identify and assess suicidal risk of adolescents. We utilize a machine learning approach to identify suicidal from non-suicidal speech as well as characterize adolescents that repeatedly attempted suicide in the past. Our findings investigate both verbal and nonverbal behavior information of the face-to-face clinician-patient interaction. We investigate 60 audio-recorded dyadic clinician-patient interviews of 30 suicidal (13 repeaters and 17 non-repeaters) and 30 non-suicidal adolescents. The interaction between clinician and adolescents is statistically analyzed to reveal differences between suicidal versus non-suicidal adolescents and to investigate suicidal repeaters' behaviors in comparison to suicidal non-repeaters. By using a hierarchical classifier we were able to show that the verbal responses to the ubiquitous questions sections of the interviews were useful to discriminate suicidal and non-suicidal patients. However, to additionally classify suicidal repeaters and suicidal non-repeaters more information especially nonverbal information is required.

DE medical aid-in-dying; suicide; agency; rationality; death; medicine;
   United States
ID LIFE; RISK; END
AB In 2017, Oregon marked the twentieth anniversary of enacting the Death with Dignity Act, allowing terminally ill, mentally competent adult patients to end their life by ingesting a lethal medication prescribed by their physician. In U.S. public discourse, medical aid-in-dying is frequently equated with the terminology and morality of suicide, much to the frustration of those who use and administer the law. This article reflects on the stakes of maintaining a distinction between a medically assisted death and the most common cultural category for self-inflicted deathsuicide. It uncovers the complicated dialectic between authorship and authorization that characterizes medical assistance in dying and attendant moralities of purposive death, speaking to broader disciplinary concerns in the cultural study of death and medicine. By stressing the primacy of debilitating, life-limiting illness in an aided death and by submitting such a death to the rationale and management of institutionalized medicine, advocates carve out a form of intentional death that occupies a category of its own. The diffusion of agency onto a patient's fatal illness, medicine, and the stateboth discursively and in practiceenhances the moral and social acceptability of an assisted death, which becomes an authorized form of dying that looks very different from the socially deviant act of suicide.

AB A total of 852 participants attending 11 centers for addiction treatment in north Italy following problems due to cocaine abuse between 1989 and 2013 were recruited. Two typologies were created: cocaine users (never heroin) (CU) and heroin and cocaine users (HCU). During the 38-year follow-up period, 4.8% of the whole cohort died. Over the whole period, tumors were the main causes of death; starting in 2010, suicide deaths became the first cause of death. Among CUs, most deaths were due to road accidents and suicide; among HCUs, most of the deaths were from opiate overdose and from cardio-circulatory system diseases. The excess mortality observed for all causes in either sex was 6.24; higher in females (15.03) as compared in males (6.23), higher in HCUs (9.06) as compared in CUs (5.21). The directly age-sex standardized mortality rates were 5.31 per 100, higher for females, declining after 2009 for all patients and after 2004 for HCUs. Multivariate analysis confirms the decreasing trend in the risk of death and shows a higher mortality risk for participants in the under-25age group. Among cocaine users, special attention should be paid to the prevention of suicide deaths.

AB In 2014, Leelah Alcorn, a homeschooled transgender teenager in the United States, died by suicide after enduring months of social isolation and her parent's repeated efforts to change her gender identity. Sexual and gender minoritized (SGM) youth who are, like Leelah, homeschooled in the U.S. do not have access to the institutional and relational supports afforded to SGM youth in public schools. This study examines how variations in educational setting, family support, internet access, and peer relationships influence mental health outcomes in a sample of 651 sexual and gender minoritized (SGM) young adults who were primarily homeschooled in Christian homes. Participants reported extremely high rates of mental illness (87%) suicidal ideation (72%), suicide attempts (22%) self-harm (66%), and substance abuse (29%). Regression analysis revealed that a positive family attitude toward SGM people (although rare) and access to the internet were the most significant protective factors against negative mental health outcomes in this sample. This study explores the unique vulnerabilities of SGM youth in Christian homeschool settings and has implications for educators, policy makers, health care providers, and mental health and social service professionals. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the experiences of homeschooled SGM youth.

AB Objectives: To investigate the risk of suicide, unnatural death and all-cause death in university students compared with non-students, taking previous educational attainment into account.
   Design: Open cohort study of all residents aged 18-39 and living in Sweden at any time between 1 January 1993 and 31 December 2011.
   Setting: We linked data from national registers and calculated person-years during university studies for three time periods (1993-1999, 2000-2005 and 2006-2011). Time as non-student was calculated and categorised according to attained educational level. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) with 95% CIs were calculated with Poisson regression models, controlling for age and period.
   Participants: The cohort consisted of 5 039 419 individuals, 51% men and 49% women.
   Main outcome measures: Incidence of suicide (International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9: E950-E959, ICD-10: X60-X84) or death with undetermined intent (ICD-9: E980-E989, ICD-10: Y10-Y34), unnatural death (ICD-9: E800-E999 and ICD-10: V01-Y99) and all-cause death.
   Results: A total of 7316 deaths due to suicide were identified, of which 541 were registered among university students. The risk of suicide was twofold during ongoing university studies compared with when having attained university education, IRR 2.37 (95% CI 2.07 to 2.72) in men and IRR 2.15 (95% CI 1.77 to 2.61) in women.
   Conclusions: Having ongoing university studies was associated with a higher risk of suicide compared with having attained university-level education. This finding highlights the importance of achieving a deeper understanding of suicidal behaviour during years at university. Further studies should assess risk factors for suicide and suicidal behaviour in university students.

AB Perceived sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth experience more bullying in schools than their heteronormative peers. The social ecological model offers a framework for exploring the phenomenon of homophobic bullying. This study aimed to describe experiences of victimized youth. Using critical qualitative inquiry, youth (N = 16) of ages 15 to 20 who self-identified as having been bullied for being perceived to be SGM and who resided in a Midwestern state in the United States were interviewed in-person or online. Thematic analysis revealed that gender nonconformity was a common factor in being bullied. Subthemes are as follows: the sociocultural context shapes school climate; victimized youth felt a perception of being seen as deviant; and, victimized youth react to victimization differently. Findings indicate that bullying for gender nonconformity is a sociocultural issue. Improving the school climate for gender nonconforming youth is still needed. Implementing supportive programs and protective policies at the broader socioecological levels can help.

The selected causes of death were impacted differently by age, sex, and race: for homicide, mortality rates were greater in ages 20-39, males, and blacks; for unintentional injuries, the rates increased with age, most noticeably in the oldest age group, and were highest among males and whites; and for suicide, the rates tended to increase with age and were greater in males and whites. Mortality rates from homicide were positively associated with poverty, cigarette smoking, air temperature, and leisure-time physical inactivity. They were negatively associated with precipitation and sunlight. Mortality rates from unintentional injuries were positively associated with altitude, cigarette smoking, air temperature, poverty, obesity, and precipitation. They were negatively associated with population density. Mortality rates from suicides were positively associated with altitude, cigarette smoking, obesity, air temperature, and precipitation and negatively associated with population density. Conclusion. The results confirm and extend previous research in which death from homicide, unintentional injuries, and suicide are distinctly associated with a combination of environmental, demographic, and lifestyle variables. The findings may be useful in developing strategies for reducing injury-related deaths.

AB Background: The termination of a romantic relationship is an established predictor of suicide attempt. Severing a relationship with a romantic figure can feel life-ending, based on attachment theory. Aims: The primary goal of this study was to determine if specific risk markers for suicide are related to an individual's commitment level to the romantic relationship prior to its dissolution. Method: The purpose of this study was to examine if commitment and investment are linked with suicidal risk in a sample of adults (n = 208) in the United States ages 18-64 who experienced the break-up of a significant romantic relationship within the past 3 months. Results: A structural equation model analysis revealed a significant association between commitment to the romantic relationship and suicidal risk when mediated by depression. This suggests that high commitment to the previous romantic relationship is indirectly associated with suicidal risk, indicating a need for increased attention to individuals who recently experienced a break-up. Limitations: This study is limited by its cross-sectional design and by retrospective accounts of the previous relationships. Conclusion: This study indicates that high commitment to a romantic relationship may serve as a risk factor of depression and therefore of suicide when the relationship is terminated.

AB Objectives. We examined a syndemic of psychosocial health issues among young men who have sex with men (MSM), with men and women (MSMW), and with women (MSW). We examined hypothesized drivers of syndemic production and effects on suicide attempts.
   Methods. Using a pooled data set of 2005 and 2007 Youth Risk Behavior Surveys from 11 jurisdictions, we used structural equation modeling to model a latent syndemic factor of depression symptoms, substance use, risky sex, and intimate partner violence. Multigroup models examined relations between victimization and bullying experiences, syndemic health issues, and serious suicide attempts.
   Results. We found experiences of victimization to increase syndemic burden among all male youths, especially MSMW and MSM compared with MSW (variance explained = 44%, 38%, and 10%, respectively). The syndemic factor was shown to increase the odds of reporting a serious suicide attempt, particularly for MSM (odds ratio [OR] = 5.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.36, 24.39; P < .001) and MSMW (OR = 5.08; 95% CI = 2.14, 12.28; P < .001) compared with MSW (OR = 3.47; 95% CI = 2.50, 4.83; P < .001).
   Conclusions. Interventions addressing multiple psychosocial health outcomes should be developed and tested to better meet the needs of young MSM and MSMW.

AB Data from a US mortality follow-back survey were analyzed to determine whether having a firearm in the home increases the risk of a violent death in the home and whether risk varies by storage practice, type of gun, or number of guns in the home.,Those persons with guns in the home were at greater risk than those without guns in the home of dying from a homicide in the home (adjusted odds ratio = 1.9, 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 3.4). they were also at greater risk of dying from a firearm homicide, but risk.. varied by age and whether the person was living with others at the time of death. The risk of dying from a suicide in the home was greater for males in homes with guns than for males without guns in the home (adjusted odds ratio = 10.4, 95% confidence interval: 5.8, 18.9). Persons with guns in the home were also more likely to have died from suicide committed with a firearm than from one committed by using a different method (adjusted odds ratio = 31.1, 95% confidence interval: 19.5, 49.6). Results show that regardless of storage practice, type of gun, or number of firearms in the home, having a-gun in the home was associated with an increased risk of firearm homicide and firearm suicide in the home.

AB BACKGROUND: Latino youth experience disproportionate rates of mental health problems including suicide and depression. Better understanding of underlying risk and protective factors on the part of school-based health professionals, teachers, and health care providers in their lives is warranted. The aims of this secondary analysis of 2004 Minnesota Student Survey data were to (1) describe the mental health status of a statewide sample of Latino 9th- and 12th-grade students; (2) explore relationships of family protective factors (communication, caring, and connection) with suicidal ideation, suicidal attempts, and emotional distress; and (3) highlight similarities and differences in family protective factors among subgroups of Latino students.
   METHODS: Parallel analyses were completed for Latino-only and Latino-mixed students. Bivariate logistic regression models were used to examine associations between each family variable and each study outcome.
   RESULTS: Nearly 1 in 5 Latino high school students have had suicidal thoughts in the past year; past year suicide attempts ranged from 6% to 18.5% across grade and gender subgroups. Most concerning are ninth-grade Latino girls, a group in which 30-40% reported suicidal thoughts and 14-19% reported attempting suicide in the past year.
   CONCLUSIONS: An important study finding is the high rate of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and emotional distress among students who self-identified as being of mixed ethnicity. Study findings can be used to inform mental health promotion initiatives and culturally tailor interventions with Latino students.

ID HEALTH-CARE; POPULATION
AB Because the United States often seems (and seems eager to present itself as) the home of the technological imperative and of determination to brand all challenges to it in end-of-life care as a descent into death panels, the prospects look unpromising for progress in US public policies that would expand the range of choices of medical treatments available to individuals preparing for death. Beneath this obdurate and intermittently hysterical surface, however, the diffusion across US states and communities of living wills, advanced directives, palliative care, hospice services and debates about assisted suicide is gradually strengthening not so much 'personal autonomy' as the authority, cultural and formal, of individuals and their loved ones not merely to shape but to lead the inevitably 'social' conversations on which decisions about care at the end of life depend. In short, the nation appears to be (in terms taken from John Donne's mediations on death) 'stealing on insensibly' - making incremental progress toward the replacement of clinical and other types of dogma with end-of-life options that honor the preferences of the dying.

AB The objective of this article is to describe the practice of psychiatric consultation with regard to explicit requests for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide in the Netherlands. Written questionnaires were sent to an unselected sample of 673 Dutch psychiatrists, about half of all such specialists in the Netherlands. The response rate was 83%. Of the respondents, 36% (199 of 549) had at least once been consulted about a patient's request for physician-assisted death. The annual number of such psychiatric consultations is estimated to be 400 (about 4% of all requests for physician-assisted death). About one in four consultations is initiated by another psychiatrist. Consultants were mainly asked to assess whether the patient had a treatable mental disorder (68%) or whether the patient's request was well considered (66%). Assessment of the influence of transference and countertransference was less frequently sought (24%). Of the 221 consultation cases described, 67 (30%) ended in euthanasia or assisted suicide, whereas another 124 (56%) did not. In most, but not all, cases where the patient's request for physician-assisted death was refused, the respondent had judged that the request was not well considered or that the patient had a treatable mental disorder, or that the decision-making was influenced by transference and countertransference. We conclude that psychiatric consultation for patients requesting physician-assisted death in the Netherlands is rare, as in other countries. The issue of psychiatric consultation with regard to requests for physician-assisted death, especially in patients with a physical disease, needs to be further addressed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB Using a sample of 1,625 homeless youth and young adults aged 10 to 25 from 28 different states in the United States, this study examines the correlates of having engaged in survival sex. Findings suggest that differences exist based on demographic variables (gender, age, race, and sexual orientation), lifetime drug use (inhalants, Valium (TM), crack cocaine, alcohol, Coricidin (TM), and morphine), recent drug use (alcohol, ecstasy, heroin, and methamphetamine), mental health variables (suicide attempts, familial history of substance use, and having been in substance abuse treatment), and health variables (sharing needles and having been tested for HIV). In addition to replicating previous findings, this study's findings suggest that African American youth; gay, lesbian, or bisexual youth; and youth who had been tested for HIV were significantly more likely to have engaged in survival sex than White, heterosexual youth, and youth who had not been tested for HIV, respectively. Implications for interventions with youth and suggestions for future research are discussed.

AB Complete Center for Disease Control death certificate records and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 100% Standard Analytic file for hospice claims for 2002 were used to describe the whole population of hospice users and nonusers in the United States. The overall hospice utilization rate for persons 65 years and older was 28.6%. Hospice utilization varied by cause of death, and was highest for individuals with malignancies (65%), kidney disease and nephritis (55%), and Alzheimer's disease (41%). Hospice utilization was lowest for conditions leading to rapid or unexpected death, such as accidents and suicide (0%), influenza and pneumonia (3%), and sepsis (6%). Considerable geographic differences in hospice utilization existed, with hospice use higher in the South and the Southwest and lower in the Midwest and the Northeast. State-specific usage rates ranged from 8% in Alaska to 49% in Arizona. Our findings highlight opportunities for the hospice industry to provide more care, opportunities defined by diagnostic and geographic axes.

AB Suicidal behaviors are of significant concern for the individuals displaying such behavior and for service providers who encounter them. Using nationally representative samples of Canadian and American adults, we aimed to examine: whether age moderates the relationship between having any anxiety disorder and suicide ideation (SI), the prevalence of SI among younger and older adults, and whether age and individual anxiety disorders were differentially associated with SI. Age moderated the relationship between any anxiety disorder and SI among Americans only. Past-year SI was less prevalent among older, compared to younger, adults; though, nearly every anxiety disorder was associated with increased odds of SI among younger and older Canadian and American adults after controlling for covariates. Effect sizes were particularly large for older American adults, but were coupled with large confidence intervals. Findings contribute to a growing literature suggesting that SI in the context of anxiety is a highly prevalent and complex mental health problem across the adult lifespan. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Religiousness as a Predictor of Suicide: An Analysis of 162 European
   Regions
SO SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
ID SERVICE ATTENDANCE; RATES; MODERNIZATION; INTEGRATION; STRAIN
AB Research on religion as a protective factor has been marked by four recurrent limitations: (1) an overemphasis on the United States, a nation where religiosity is relatively high; (2) a neglect of highly secularized zones of the world, where religiousness may be too weak to affect suicide; (3) restriction of religiousness to religious affiliation, a construct which may miss capturing other dimensions of religiousness such as the importance of religion in one's life; and (4) an overwhelming use of the nation as a unit of analysis, which masks variation in religiousness within nations. The present article addresses these limitations by performing a cross-national test of the following hypothesis: The greater the strength of subjective religiousness, the lower the suicide rate, using small units of analysis for a secularized area of the world. All data refer to 162 regions within 22 European nations. Data were extracted from two large databases, EUROSTAT and the European Social Surveys (ESS Round 4), and merged using NUTS-2 (Nomenclature of Statistical Territorial Units) regions as the unit of analysis. Controls are incorporated for level of economic development, education, and measures of economic strain. The results of a multiple regression analysis demonstrated that controlling for the other constructs in the model, religiousness is associated with lower suicide rates, confirming the hypothesis. Even in secularized European nations, where there is a relatively weak moral community to reinforce religion, religiousness acts as a protective factor against suicide. Future work is needed to explore the relationship in other culture zones of the world.

ID FAMILY DOCTORS; UNITED-STATES; DEATH; LIFE; ACT; END
AB Consultation with another physician is considered to be an important safeguard of the practice of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. The objective is to describe the frequency and characteristics of consultation in cases of euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (EAS) in the Netherlands, Data from two cross-sectional descriptive nationwide surveys, carried out in 1995, were used. Questionnaires were mailed to physicians attending 6060 deaths, identified from death certificates, and a stratified sample of 405 physicians were interviewed. In 1990, a cross-sectional descriptive postal survey of a random sample of 1042 general practitioners took place. Consultation took place in 63% of cases of EAS in the Netherlands, in 99% of the cases reported to the public prosecutor and in approximately 37% of unreported cases. In almost half of the unreported cases the decision had been discussed less formally with at least one colleague. In 1990, 7% of general practitioners met all 8 criteria for good consultation; this increased to 64% in 1995. Of the respondents, 26% had at some time advised against performing euthanasia or assisted suicide when acting as a consultant. This study shows that approximately two thirds of all cases of EAS are safeguarded by consultation. Although in the majority of these cases the consultation is of good quality, there is certainly still room for improvement. The quality of consultation could be improved, for instance, by appointing independent and specifically trained consultants. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Problem: Subway transit is a relatively safe mode of transportation, yet compared to all other forms of mass transit in the United States (U.S.), subways have the highest fatality rate. The aim of this paper is to characterize subway-related fatalities in order to identify opportunities for risk reduction. Method: Medical examiner records for all New York City (NYC) subway-related deaths (1990-2003) were reviewed. Data were abstracted on decedents' demographics and autopsy findings, including laboratory findings. Results: There were 668 subway-related fatalities, of these, 10 (1.5%) were homicides, 343 (51.3%) were determined to be suicides, and 315 (47.2%) were accidental. Although decedent characteristics varied between fatality categories, they were not particularly informative with regard to prevention. Conclusion: Prevention strategies that focus on structural controls are likely to be most efficacious in improving the overall safety of the NYC subway systems. Impact on industry: These findings suggest that structural rather than individual-level interventions would be most successful in preventing subway fatalities.

AB OBJECTIVE
   To determine whether restrictiveness-permissiveness of state gun laws or gun ownership are associated with mass shootings in the US.
   DESIGN
   Cross sectional time series.
   SETTING AND POPULATION
   US gun owners from 1998-2015.
   EXPOSURE
   An annual rating between 0 (completely restrictive) and 100 (completely permissive) for the gun laws of all 50 states taken from a reference guide for gun owners traveling between states from 1998 to 2015. Gun ownership was estimated annually as the percentage of suicides committed with firearms in each state.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE
   Mass shootings were defined as independent events in which four or more people were killed by a firearm. Data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reporting System from 1998-2015 were used to calculate annual rates of mass shootings in each state. Mass shooting events and rates were further separated into those where the victims were immediate family members or partners (domestic) and those where the victims had other relationships with the perpetrator (non-domestic).
   RESULTS
   Fully adjusted regression analyses showed that a 10 unit increase in state gun law permissiveness was associated with a significant 11.5% (95% confidence interval 4.2% to 19.3%, P= 0.002) higher rate of mass shootings. A 10% increase in state gun ownership was associated with a significant 35.1% (12.7% to 62.7%, P= 0.001) higher rate of mass shootings. Partially adjusted regression analyses produced similar results, as did analyses restricted to domestic and non-domestic mass shootings.
   CONCLUSIONS
   States with more permissive gun laws and greater gun ownership had higher rates of mass shootings, and a growing divide appears to be emerging between restrictive and permissive states.

AB During young adulthood the suicide rate among Blacks rises dramatically and approaches that of the U.S. general population, requiring that prevention efforts include a focus on Black young adults. Although most research on suicidality among Blacks has focused on risk factors observed in the dominant culture, in this study the authors examined associations between perceived discrimination, racism, and acculturation with lifetime suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempt (SA) among Black young adults. Two hundred fifty Black or African American individuals aged 18-24 residing in a midsize northeastern city were recruited to participate through advertisements. Participants filled out self-report questionnaires. Logistic regressions were used to examine the association of each predictor with SI and SA. Greater perceived acculturation was associated with SI in univariate and multivariate models. There were no other statistically significant results concerning the predictors of interest. The link between perceived acculturation and SI is consistent with limited available data, indicating the need for further study including the potential mechanism(s) for the association. Limitations include the cross-sectional design and reliance on subjective measures.

AB Despite increased awareness of the prevalence and seriousness of mental health problems in early childhood, there have been few empirical studies of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in this age group. This study examined suicidal thoughts and behaviors in 360 preschool-aged children (ages 3 to 7 years) presenting to a psychiatric day treatment program. A semi-structured diagnostic interview (conducted with primary caregivers) was used to assess for child suicidal thoughts and behaviors and psychiatric disorders. Participating mothers also reported on their own psychological distress and family psychiatric history. Forty-eight children (13%) were reported to have suicidal thoughts and behaviors, with suicidal plans or attempts endorsed for 2-3% of the sample. Suicidal thinking and behavior was associated with older child age and with higher rates of concurrent depression, oppositional defiant disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder in univariate analyses, with age and depression remaining as significant predictors in a multivariate logistic regression model. Findings suggest that suicidal thoughts and behaviors are a significant clinical concern for young children presenting with early psychopathology, particularly depression, with implications for early childhood psychiatric assessment and treatment.

AB Objective: No studies have estimated the difference in suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts for lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) adults aged 50+ compared with heterosexuals using nationally representative data. Methods: We used 2015-2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health data to estimate the prevalence of self-reported suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts for LGB adults 50+ compared with heterosexuals in the preceding 12 months. Results: Over 185,000 LGB adults aged 50+ in the United States were estimated to have had suicidal ideation in the preceding year. After adjusting for sex and race/ethnicity, LGB individuals aged 50+ had a 4.5 percentage point higher prevalence of suicidal ideation compared with heterosexuals (prevalence difference [PD]: 0.045; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.022, 0.067). Of those with suicidal ideation, LGB individuals aged 50+ had a 17.2 percentage point higher prevalence of suicide plans compared with heterosexuals (PD: 0.172; 95% CI: 0.011, 0.332). Conclusion: LGB adults in middle and older age have higher suicidal ideation and plans than heterosexual peers.

AB Opioid analgesics are recognized as a legitimate medical therapy for selected patients with severe chronic pain that does not respond to other therapies. However, opioids are associated with risks for patients and society that include misuse, abuse, diversion, addiction, and overdose deaths. Therapeutic success depends on proper candidate selection, assessment before administering opioid therapy, and close monitoring throughout the course of treatment. Risk assessment and prevention include knowledge of patient factors that may contribute to misuse, abuse, addiction, suicide, and respiratory depression. Risk factors for opioid misuse or addiction include past or current substance abuse, untreated psychiatric disorders, younger age, and social or family environments that encourage misuse. Opioid mortality prevalence is higher in people who are middle aged and have substance abuse and psychiatric comorbidities. Suicides are probably undercounted or frequently misclassified in reports of opioid-related poisoning deaths. Greater understanding and better assessment are needed of the risk associated with suicide risk in patients with pain. Clinical tools and an evolving evidence base are available to assist clinicians with identifying patients whose risk factors put them at risk for adverse outcomes with opioids.

AB Cyberbullying: a worldwide trend of misusing technology to harass others.
   Technology has led to a new form of bullying in the 21(st) century called cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is using the Internet or a cell phone to harass a victim with pictures and text. There have been reports in the media of youth being harassed by e-mail, postings on websites, instant messages, and mobile text messages worldwide.
   This paper summarizes findings about the prevalence and effects of cyberbullying from studies conducted in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Results of the studies were compared to media reports of cyberbullying and traditional bullying research. Strategies to stop and prevent cyberbullying were discussed.
   The percentage of respondents experiencing incidents of cyberbullying in the studies ranged from 10% to 42%. The mobile phone was the predominant method of cyberbullying in Australia and the United Kingdom, whereas the Internet was the favoured method in the United States and Canada.
   Some victims of cyberbullying have been driven to suicide while others remain unaffected by it. The most common feelings of victims were anger, sadness, frustration, and fear. Independent studies in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada documented that parents and children do not discuss cyberbullying.
   It is recommended that schools establish and post acceptable use policies for the Internet. Parents need to be educated about cyberbullying so that they can impose consequences if their child is harassing another child. Real time computerized reporting systems such Text Someone can be used to augment reporting of incidents. Showing students how mobile phone calls and e-mail messages can be traced may deter cyberbullying.

AB This study examined relationships between variation in child and adolescent firearm mortality by state and the following variables: childhood poverty rate, percent single parent families, percent population that is African American, percent population that is Hispanic, percent students carrying a gun, percent students carrying a weapon, percent students feeling unsafe, percent students feeling sad/hopeless, percent students academically at-risk, percent students involved infighting, percent students engaging in binge drinking behavior, violent crime rate for youths, individual gun laws in each state, prevalence of firearm ownership, and percent residing in urban area. Stepwise regression was calculated and one independent variable, prevalence of firearm ownership in the state, emerged as a significant predictor of child and adolescent firearm mortality. This variable predicted 47% of the variance from state to state in the child and adolescent firearm mortality. Schools need to address firearm safety and advocate for elimination of firearms accessible to youth.

AB Background: Given challenges that exceed the normal developmental requirements of adolescence, deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) youth are believed to be at elevated risk for engaging in suicide-related behavior (SRB). Unfortunately, little is known about the mechanisms that put these youth potentially at risk. Aims: To determine whether peer relationship difficulties are related to increased risk of SRB in DHH youth. Method: Student records (n = 74) were retrieved from an accredited educational center for deaf and blind students in the United States. Results: Peer relationship difficulties were found to be significantly associated with engagement in SRB but not when accounting for depressive symptomatology. Limitations: The restricted sample limits generalizability. Conclusions regarding risk causation cannot be made due to the cross-sectional nature of the study. Conclusion: These results suggest the need for future research that examines the mechanisms of the relationship between peer relationship difficulties, depression, and suicide risk in DHH youth and potential preventive interventions to ameliorate the risks for these at-risk youth.

DE Pellets; Shotgun; Wound
ID SUICIDE RATES; UNITED-STATES; FIREARM; ACCESS
AB Introduction: Determination of suicide as the cause of death due to shotguns can be challenging because shotguns are usually designed for hunting, sport, and recreation. Therefore, the impact of their bullets on the human body may present several unclear signs. In this case, pellets were reported to spread in contact wounds. The manner of death seemed to be initially murder yet after the autopsy, it seemed suicidal.
   Case Presentation: The incident occurred during March 2015 in a house in the capital city of Iran, Tehran. The case was a 39-year-old man, who upon initial examination, was reported to have committed suicide using a shotgun. This was evident by the presence of distributed pellets in the chest and pelvis, which confirmed a contact shot.
   Conclusions: The following were hypothesized: 1- After the plastic cap of the bullet hit the sternum, it was fragmented, and pellets were scattered. 2- Regarding the existence of the pellets in the heart's ventricles, it seemed the pellets were distributed immediately through the aorta, to the chest, and through to the abdominal aorta, and the pelvis.

TI Self-injurious implicit attitudes among adolescent suicide attempters

AB Background: Suicide is among the most important mental health issues affecting adolescents today despite much research on its detection and prevention. Beyond suicide attempts (SAs), clinicians are increasingly confronted with another, potentially related problem: non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI)-defined as the deliberate destruction of body tissue without intent to die. NSSI may increase risk for making an SA by sevenfold, but many studies examining this link have involved youths engaging in both NSSI and SAs. Thus, there is a need to compare homogeneous groups of adolescents engaged in NSSI-only or SA-only, but not both, to advance what is known about each form of self-harm. The self-injurious implicit association task (SI-IAT) is a particularly important computerized behavioral task to study such adolescents because the SI-IAT provides objective behavioral data about problems for which people may lack insight or be motivated to conceal, such as SAs and NSSI. Methods: We evaluated implicit associations with cutting and death/suicide using the computerized SI-IAT in three mutually exclusive groups: (1) adolescents who made an SA but had never engaged in NSSI (n = 47); (2) adolescents who engaged in NSSI but had never made an SA (n = 46); and (3) typically developing control (TDC) adolescents without history of psychiatric problems (n = 43). Results: Nonsuicidal self-injury participants had stronger identification with cutting versus no cutting than either SA or TDC participants. Contrary to our hypothesis, NSSI participants had stronger identification with suicide/death versus life than either SA or TDC participants. Conclusions: Strong implicit attitudes towards suicide/death among adolescents with NSSI without a prior SA suggest that clinicians should not dismiss NSSI as not serious. Further work is required to elucidate the mechanism by which youths engaged in NSSI acquire these stronger identifications and make a first-time SA to develop novel treatment and prevention strategies blocking this transformation, ultimately reducing youth suicide.

AB This article reports cultural differences in the relationship between personality characteristics and euthanasia attitudes using samples from Iran and the United States. Survey data from university students were analyzed using multivariate regression. Results indicate that while attitudes toward euthanasia are significantly more positive among the U.S. sample, there is significantly greater variation among the Iranian sample. Honesty-Humility and Openness to Experience are predictive factors in both samples, where Agreeableness is only significant among the Iranian group. Additionally, Chow tests of structural features of the multivariate models show significant differences between the two samples. We conclude by discussing implications of these results for understanding cultural similarities and differences in attitudes toward euthanasia, including the practical implications of this work for patient care in an increasingly globalized world.

AB Firearm violence in United States has been a persistent concern for decades particularly in light of mass shootings. Firearm violence is increasingly viewed as a public health crisis, and results in a heavy financial burden to society. In light of the continuous challenges associated with firearm violence, limited research in the area, it is necessary to examine current trends regarding firearm deaths and injuries. Extant data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Web-based Inquiry Statistics Query and Reporting System fatal and nonfatal injury reports were used for this study. Available data were examined in light of age groups across the life span, region, gender, and minority status for both fatalities and injuries related to firearms. Strategies for reducing firearm fatalities, particularly among children and youth, are also discussed.

AB Previous research suggests that bisexual men face unique health concerns in comparison to their exclusively homosexual and heterosexual counterparts. However, little is known about behaviorally bisexual men's experiences with health services, including ways of providing services that would be most appropriate to meet the health needs of this population. This study sought to understand preferences for health-related services among behaviorally bisexual men in the Midwestern United States. Using a community-based research approach, a diverse sample of 75 behaviorally bisexual men was recruited for in-depth interviews. Qualitative data were analyzed utilizing inductive coding through established team-based protocols to ensure reliability. Themes emerged involving the importance of privacy and trust when reaching, recruiting, and engaging behaviorally bisexual men in health services. Findings suggest that multifaceted approaches are needed, including those that provide relevant and confidential services while allowing for the development and ongoing maintenance of trust.

AB Every four years, partisan Americans threaten to migrate to Canada (or some other country) if their preferred candidate loses the Presidential election. This phenomenon has yet to undergo an empirical test. In the present experiment, 308 Obama voters and 142 Romney voters following the 2012 election responded to one of two writing prompts that led them to think about how the United States was becoming more liberal or conservative. Regardless of the writing prompt condition, Romney voters endorsed migration expressions more than Obama voters. Furthermore, Romney voters, compared to Obama voters, expressed a reduced sense of belonging in the United States. The relationship between voting for Romney and migration expressions was fully mediated by sense of belonging. Together, these findings support the ideological migration hypothesis and suggest that threatening to move to Canada following an undesirable election outcome may be driven by voters' belonging needs.

AB Objective: Suicide is one of the leading causes of injury-related mortality in the United States and prior research has identified alcohol and other drug use as a major risk factor. In recent years, prescription drug misuse has become a serious public health issue; however, very little research examines the relationship between prescription drug misuse and suicide or suicidal ideation.
   Methods: Using data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, the current research examines the relationship between prescription drug misuse and suicidal ideation among adults. Suicidal ideation was measured by asking respondents if they seriously thought about killing themselves in the past 12 months. Prescription drug misuse was defined as use without a prescription or solely for the feeling or experience caused by the drug in the past 12 months. Several multivariable logistic regression models were estimated.
   Results: Findings show that respondents who report prescription drug misuse in the past year, specifically pain relievers, are more likely to report that they had seriously though about killing themselves.
   Conclusions: The current research fills an important gap in the literature by examining the relationship between prescription drug misuse and suicidal ideation. Consistent with the extant literature, prescription drug misuse is significantly associated with suicidal ideation among adults. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Burnout is a concern for radiologists. The burnout rate is greater among diagnostic radiologists than the mean for all physicians, while radiation oncologists have a slightly lower burnout rate. Burnout can result in unprofessional behavior, thoughts of suicide, premature retirement, and errors in patient care. Strategies to reduce burnout include addressing the sources of job dissatisfaction, instilling lifestyle balance, finding reasons to work other than money, improving money management, developing a support group, and seeking help when needed.

AB Background: Across Europe, Canada, and the United States, 22-43 % of transgender (trans) people report a history of suicide attempts. We aimed to identify intervenable factors (related to social inclusion, transphobia, or sex/gender transition) associated with reduced risk of past-year suicide ideation or attempt, and to quantify the potential population health impact.
   Methods: The Trans PULSE respondent-driven sampling (RDS) survey collected data from trans people age 16+ in Ontario, Canada, including 380 who reported on suicide outcomes. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression models were weighted using RDS II methods. Counterfactual risk ratios and population attributable risks were estimated using model-standardized risks.
   Results: Among trans Ontarians, 35.1 % (95 % CI: 27.6, 42.5) seriously considered, and 11.2 % (95 % CI: 6.0, 16.4) attempted, suicide in the past year. Social support, reduced transphobia, and having any personal identification documents changed to an appropriate sex designation were associated with large relative and absolute reductions in suicide risk, as was completing a medical transition through hormones and/or surgeries (when needed). Parental support for gender identity was associated with reduced ideation. Lower self-reported transphobia (10th versus 90th percentile) was associated with a 66 % reduction in ideation (RR = 0.34, 95 % CI: 0.17, 0.67), and an additional 76 % reduction in attempts among those with ideation (RR = 0.24; 95 % CI: 0.07, 0.82). This corresponds to potential prevention of 160 ideations per 1000 trans persons, and 200 attempts per 1,000 with ideation, based on a hypothetical reduction of transphobia from current levels to the 10th percentile.
   Conclusions: Large effect sizes were observed for this controlled analysis of intervenable factors, suggesting that interventions to increase social inclusion and access to medical transition, and to reduce transphobia, have the potential to contribute to substantial reductions in the extremely high prevalences of suicide ideation and attempts within trans populations. Such interventions at the population level may require policy change.

We introduce the actions of these foundations that aim to both change society by fighting against social, economic, and political inequalities, and to change philanthropy itself by creating mechanisms that do not reproduce these inequalities. We analyze this development, first as an organizational challenge, by studying the experiments carried out since 1970s, then as a personal challenge for these rebellious inheritors, who use their fortune to fight against the hegemony of their own social class.

AB This article summarizes and critiques available evidence from studies published between 1999 and August 2014 on the effects of policies designed to keep firearms from high-risk individuals in the United States. Some prohibitions for high-risk individuals (e.g., those under domestic violence restraining orders, violent misdemeanants) and procedures for checking for more types of prohibiting conditions are associated with lower rates of violence. Certain laws intended to prevent prohibited persons from accessing firearms-rigorous permit-to-purchase, comprehensive background checks, strong regulation and oversight of gun dealers, and requiring gun owners to promptly report lost or stolen firearms-are negatively associated with the diversion of guns to criminals. Future research is needed to examine whether these laws curtail nonlethal gun violence and whether the effects of expanding prohibiting conditions for firearm possession are modified by the presence of policies to prevent diversion.

AB Prior research on suicidal ideation and its correlates among South Asian American individuals has been limited. Given that South Asian American individuals are a burgeoning ethnic subgroup in the United States population, research regarding these factors is necessary to inform culturally competent suicide screening, prevention, and intervention among this increasingly prominent group. We examined depressive symptoms, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation among a sample of 204 undergraduate South Asian American (96 Bangladeshi American, 67 Asian Indian, and 41 Pakistani American) emerging adult students (66% female), ages 18 to 24 (M = 18.52, SD = 0.93). Participants completed measures of hopelessness, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation. Bangladeshi American ethnicity was associated with significantly lower levels of suicidal ideation than Asian Indian ethnicity. There was a nonsignificant trend for Pakistani American ethnicity to be associated with lower levels of suicidal ideation than Asian Indian ethnicity. Additionally, Bangladeshi American ethnicity and Pakistani American ethnicity each interacted with hopelessness, such that hopelessness was associated with lower levels of suicidal ideation among these groups than among their Asian Indian peers. Being of Asian Indian ethnicity may deleteriously influence vulnerability to suicidal ideation, while being of other South Asian American ethnicities may buffer against suicidal ideation, both independently and in interaction with hopelessness. Such contingencies should be considered during suicide screening, prevention, and intervention.

AB Gunfire from assaults, suicides, and unintentional shootings exacts an enormous burden on public health globally. The epidemiologic reviews in this special issue enhance our understanding of various forms of gun violence, inform interventions, and help chart directions for future research. The available science, however, is limited to answer many important questions necessary for mounting successful efforts to reduce gun violence. Certain data are lacking, and there are numerous analytical challenges to deriving unbiased estimates of policy impacts. Significant investments in research over the long term are warranted to answer questions central to successful prevention of gun violence.

AB Purpose: The aims of this project were to document all-cause and suicide mortality among Veteran Healthcare Administration (VHA) utilizers with The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis consistent with transgender status.
   Methods: The study population consisted of VHA patients identified as having any one of four diagnosis codes indicating transgender status (n = 5,117) gathered from the VA National Patient Care Database. Mortality data were gathered from the National Death Index from 2000-2009 for 1,277 veterans with transgender-related ICD-9-CM diagnoses. The remaining 3,840 were not searched because they had VHA utilization after 2009 (indicating they were alive). Person-time at risk (person-years) for crude rates were calculated based on the time from an individual's index diagnosis to either death or the end of FY 2009. Causes of death were categorized using ICD-10 code groups.
   Results: Approximately 9.3% (n = 309) veterans with transgender-related ICD-9-CM diagnoses died across the study period. Although diseases of the circulatory system and neoplasms were the first and second leading causes of death, respectively, the other ranked causes of mortality differed somewhat from patterns for the US during the same time span. The crude suicide rate among veterans with transgender-related ICD-9-CM diagnoses across the 10-year period was approximately 82/100,000 person-years, which approximated the crude suicide death rates for other serious mental illness in VHA (e.g., depression, schizophrenia). The average age of suicide decedents was 49.4 years.
   Conclusion: The crude suicide rate among veterans with transgender-related ICD-9-CM diagnoses is higher than in the general population, and they may be dying by suicide at younger ages than their veteran peers without transgender-related ICD-9-CM diagnoses. Future research, such as age-adjusted rates or accounting for psychiatric co-morbidities, will help to better clarify if the all-cause and suicide mortality rates are elevated for veterans with transgender-related ICD-9-CM diagnoses.

AB We provide the first evaluation of the effect of the U.S. minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) on nonfatal injuries. Using administrative records from several states and a regression discontinuity approach, we document that inpatient hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) visits increase by 8.4 and 71.3 per 10,000 person-years, respectively, at age 21. These effects are due mainly to an increase in the rate at which young men experience accidental injuries, alcohol overdoses, and injuries inflicted by others. Our results suggest that the literature's disproportionate focus on mortality leads to a significant underestimation of the benefits of tighter alcohol control.

AB Two recent novels by Algerians (Tahar Djaout's The Last Summer of Reason, and Slimane Benaissa's The Last Night of a Damned Soul) offer critiques of Islamic totalitarianism in two settings: local Arab states like the one fictionalized by Djaout, and the cosmopolitan community of diasporic Muslims recruited to the ranks of suicide bombers in the name of self-and social purification. Djaout, assassinated by fundamentalists outside his home in Algeria for writing against them, and Benaissa, charting the psychological path towards violence taken by one westernized Muslim in the United States, instantiate the ongoing debate within Islam.

AB The aim of this review was to review research addressing the relationship between population drinking and health, particularly mortality. The review is based primarily on articles published in international journals after 1994 to February 2005, identified via Medline. The method used in most studies is time- series analysis based on autoregressive intergrated moving average (ARIMA) modelling. The outcome measures covered included the following mortality indicators: mortality from liver cirrhosis and other alcohol-related diseases, accident mortality, suicide, homicide, ischaemic heart disease ( IHD) mortality and all- cause mortality. The study countries included most of the EU member states as of 1995 ( 14 countries), Canada and the United States. For Eastern Europe there was only scanty evidence. The study period was in most cases the post-war period. There was a statistically significant relationship between per capita consumption and mortality from liver cirrhosis and other alcohol-related diseases in all countries. In about half the countries, there was a significant relationship between consumption, on one hand, and mortality from accidents and homicide as well as all- cause mortality on the other hand. A link between alcohol and suicide was found in all regions except for mid- and southern Europe. There was no systematic link between consumption and IHD mortality. Overall, a 1-litre increase in per capita consumption was associated with a stronger effect in northern Europe and Canada than in mid- and southern Europe. Research during the past decade has strengthened the notion of a relationship between population drinking and alcohol- related harm. At the same time, the marked regional variation in the magnitude of this relationship suggests the importance of drinking patterns for modifying the impact of alcohol. By and large, there was little evidence for any cardioprotective effect at the population level. It is a challenge for future research to reconcile this outcome with the findings from observational studies, most of which suggest a protective effect of moderate drinking.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Despite recent national attention on deaths from firearms, little information exists about children and adolescents who are hospitalized for firearm injuries. The objective was to determine the national frequency of firearm-related hospitalizations in the United States in children, compare rates by cause and demographics, and describe hospitalized cases. METHODS: We used the 2009 Kids' Inpatient Database to identify hospitalizations from firearm-related injuries in young people,20 years of age; International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, and external-cause-of injury codes were used to categorize the injuries and the causes as follows: assault, suicide attempt, unintentional, or undetermined. Incidences were calculated by using the weighted number of cases and the intercensal population. Risk ratios compared incidences. RESULTS: In 2009, 7391 (95% confidence interval [ CI]: 6523-8259) hospitalizations were due to firearm-related injuries. The hospitalization rate was 8.87 (95% CI: 7.83-9.92) per 100 000 persons, 20 years of age. Hospitalizations due to assaults were most frequent (n = 4559) and suicide attempts were least frequent (n = 270). Of all hospitalizations, 89.2% occurred in males; the hospitalization rate for males was 15.22 per 100 000 (95% CI: 13.41-17.03) and for females was 1.93 (95% CI: 1.66-2.20). The rate for black males was 44.77 (95% CI: 36.69-52.85),a rate more than 10 times that for white males. Rates were highest for those aged 15 to 19 years (27.94; 95% CI: 24.42-31.46). Deaths in the hospital occurred in 453 (6.1%); of those hospitalized after suicide attempts, 35.1% died. CONCLUSIONS: On average, 20 US children and adolescents were hospitalized each day in 2009 due to firearm injuries. Public health efforts are needed to reduce this common source of childhood injury.

AB The problem of psychological state of modern Russian society is in the focus of the analysis. For the purposes of the quantitative estimation of this state the author used a Composite Index elaborated by him and based on the integration of 6 primary indicators: Index of Mortality from the Diseases of the Nervous System and Sense Organs, Index of Homicide, Index of the Mental Illnesses, Index of the Family Stability, Index of the Social Orphanhood and Index of Suicide Mortality. The Index allowed to estimate quantitatively the dynamics of psychological state of Russian society from 1991 to 2016. The author analyses this dynamics in relation to social-economic and political events. The dynamics of primary indicators united by the Composite Index is also under analysis. Indices of Mortality from Homicide and Suicide reflect the mean trends of the Composite Index. The Index of the Diseases of Nervous System remained stable until 2012 and then showed the dramatic drop, while the Index of the Mental Illnesses remained relatively stable. Indices of the Family Stability and the Social Orphanhood showed complex tendencies, which can be explained by the general dynamics only partially. The latency of the Indices is discussed. The results of other investigations - sociological and psychological, characterizing the psychological state of modern Russian society and its dynamics are presented. The author comes to the conclusion about the existence of socio-psycho-somatic influence implied in the fact that social processes are reflected in the psychological state of citizens which in its turn has important somatic consequences.

AB Context Little is known about trends in suicidal ideation, plans, gestures, or attempts or about their treatment. Such data are needed to guide and evaluate policies to reduce suicide-related behaviors.
   Objective To analyze nationally representative trend data on suicidal ideation, plans, gestures, attempts, and their treatment.
   Design, Setting, and Participants Data came from the 1990-1992 National Comorbidity Survey and the 2001-2003 National Comorbidity Survey Replication. These surveys asked identical questions to 9708 people aged 18 to 54 years about the past year's occurrence of suicidal ideation, plans, gestures, attempts, and treatment. Trends were evaluated by using pooled logistic regression analysis. Face-to-face interviews were administered in the homes of respondents, who were nationally representative samples of US English-speaking residents,
   Main Outcome Measure Self-reports about suicide-related behaviors and treatment in the year before interview.
   Results No significant changes occurred between 1990-1992 and 2001-2003 in suicidal ideation (2.8% vs 3.3%; P=.43), plans (0.7% vs 1.0%; P=.15), gestures (0.3% vs 0.2%; P=.24), or attempts (0.4%-0.6%; P=.45), whereas conditional prevalence of plans among ideators increased significantly (from 19.6% to 28.6%; P=.04), and conditional prevalence of gestures among planners decreased significantly (from 21.4% to 6.4%; P=.003). Treatment increased dramatically among ideators who made a gesture (40.3% vs 92.8%) and among ideators who made an attempt (49.6% vs 79.0%).
   Conclusions Despite a dramatic increase in treatment, no significant decrease occurred in suicidal thoughts, plans, gestures, or attempts in the United States during the 1990s. Continued efforts are needed to increase outreach to untreated individuals with suicidal ideation before the occurrence of attempts and to improve treatment effectiveness for such cases.

AB BACKGROUND: Physician burnout in the United States has reached epidemic proportions and is rising rapidly, although burnout in other occupations is stable. Its negative impact is far reaching and includes harm to the burned-out physician, as well as patients, coworkers, family members, close friends, and healthcare organizations.
   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to provide an accurate, current summary of what is known about physician burnout and to develop a framework to reverse its current negative impact, decrease its prevalence, and implement effective organizational and personal interventions.
   DATA SOURCES: I completed a comprehensive MEDLINE search of the medical literature from January 1, 2000, through December 28, 2016, related to medical student and physician burnout, stress, depression, suicide ideation, suicide, resiliency, wellness, and well-being. In addition, I selectively reviewed secondary articles, books addressing the relevant issues, and oral presentations at national professional meetings since 2013.
   STUDY SELECTION: Healthcare organizations within the United States were studied.
   RESULTS: The literature review is presented in 5 sections covering the basics of defining and measuring burnout; its impact, incidence, and causes; and interventions and remediation strategies.
   CONCLUSIONS: All US medical students, physicians in training, and practicing physicians are at significant risk of burnout. Its prevalence now exceeds 50%. Burnout is the unintended net result of multiple, highly disruptive changes in society at large, the medical profession, and the healthcare system. Both individual and organizational strategies have been only partially successful in mitigating burnout and in developing resiliency and well-being among physicians. Two highly effective strategies are aligning personal and organizational values and enabling physicians to devote 20% of their work activities to the part of their medical practice that is especially meaningful to them. More research is needed.

AB The objective of this study was to replicate previous findings indicating that early-onset panic attack (less than or equal to 20 years) with fear represents a possible prodrome of early-onset severe psychopathology. Data were drawn from the Epidemiologic Catchment Area Survey (ECA) (n=20 291), a household sample of adults aged 18 and older drawn from five cities in the United States. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to differentiate those with early-onset panic attacks with fear from those with other panic attacks (early-onset without fear, late-onset without fear, late-onset with fear) with regard to psychiatric comorbidity, age at onset of comorbid mental disorders, and suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Results of statistical analyses revealed that early-onset fearful panic attack (n = 368) was associated with increased likelihood of major affective and substance use disorders, significantly earlier onset of comorbid mental disorders, higher rates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt, and higher rates of antisocial personality disorder compared with those with other subtypes of panic attacks. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that early-onset fearful panic was independently associated with increased odds of major depression [OR= 3.0 (2.6, 3.5)], bipolar disorder [OR=7.9 (5.7, 10.8)], antisocial personality disorder [OR=1.5 (1.3, 1.7)], agoraphobia [OR=1.2 (1.1, 1.4)], simple phobia [OR=1.6 (1.4, 1.8)], and alcohol dependence [OR = 1.3 (1.2, 1.5)], compared with those with all other panic attacks. These findings are consistent with previous epidemiologic data and provide new evidence to suggest that early-onset fearful panic attack may be a marker of increased vulnerability to severe and persistent psychopathology and associated with high rates of suicidality, (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

TI A Historical Examination of Military Records of US Army Suicide, 1819 to
   2017
SO JAMA NETWORK OPEN

DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES-ARMY; UNION FORCES; PERSONNEL
AB IMPORTANCE Suicide rates among active-duty personnel in the US military have increased substantially since 2004, and numerous studies have attempted to contextualize and better understand this phenomenon. Placing contemporary examinations of suicides among active-duty personnel in the US Army in historical context provides opportunities for joint historical and epidemiological research to inform health care professionals and policy makers.
   OBJECTIVES To consolidate data on suicide rates among active-duty personnel in the US Army as far back as historical records allow and to identify historical trends to separate them from more acute causal factors.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study included all active-duty service members in the US Army from 1819 to 2017 as identified and detailed in US government publications, studies, and journal articles. Empirical data were extracted from US government publications and journal articles published from 1819 to 2017. Data collection and analysis were completed between July and August of 2019.
   EXPOSURE Suicide.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Suicide rates per 100 000 individuals.
   RESULTS Starting in 1843, the overall trend in annual suicide rates among active-duty service members in the US Army increased, with a peak rate of 118.3 per 100 000 in 1883. From that historical high point, the rate decreased in 3 successive waves, each corresponding to the end of the following wars: the Spanish-American War (1898), World War I (1914-1918), and World War II (19391945). The latter had the historically lowest rate of 5 per 100 000 in 1944 to 1945. During the Cold War (approximately 1945-1991), the rate generally stabilized in the low teens to midteens (ie, 10-15 per 100 000). The rate increased again during the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars, increasing to 29.7 per 100 000 in 2012. From 2008 to present, the annual rate has remained within the range of 20.2 to 29.7 per 100 000.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study represents the most extensive historical examination of suicides in the US Army to date. By taking a long-term historical approach to suicide among active-duty personnel in the US Army, this study affords future researchers a new analytical tool and an additional perspective from which to better differentiate long-term and historical trends from more short-term and temporary causal factors.

AB Objectives: The objective of this study was to calculate national estimates of depression-related emergency department (ED) visits and associated health care resource use among children and adolescents 17 years or younger. Another goal was to explore the effects of certain sociodemographic and health care system factors and comorbidities on ED charges and subsequent hospitalization in the United States.
   Methods: The authors analyzed data from the 2006 and 2009 National Emergency Department Sample (NEDS), the largest source of U. S. ED data. ED visits with all listed diagnoses (i.e., principal diagnosis plus secondary conditions) of depression were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes 293.83, 296.2X, 296.3X, 300.4, and 311. Population-based estimates of ED visits, hospitalization, resource use, comorbidities, and demographics associated with pediatric depression were calculated. Potentially significant covariate associations were also explored using ED charges and hospital admission from the ED.
   Results: The 2006 and 2009 NEDS sample contained 365,713 ED visits for pediatric depression; the majority were made by adolescents (87.9%). Of these, 27.2% were admitted to the hospital, 69.5% were treated and released, and <0.1% died in ED. The ED charges in 2012 U. S. dollars summed to a hospital bill of $443.8 million, with the ED plus inpatient charges ($1.2 billion) being more than double that amount. The median inpatient length of stay (LOS) was 4.0 days. Suicide and intentional self-inflicted injury were attempted by 31.4% of the patients. Attention-deficit, conduct, and disruptive disorders; anxiety disorders; substance use disorders; asthma; and infections were the most common comorbidities. In year 2009, a higher number of diagnoses, older age, being female, key comorbidities, and suicide and intentional self-inflicted injury were significantly associated with higher ED charges (all p < 0.05). Increased odds of hospital admission from the ED were significantly associated with a higher number of diagnoses, key comorbidities, and suicide and intentional self-inflicted injury (all p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Pediatric depression is common in the ED and is associated with significant burden to the health care system. Certain factors such as a higher number of diagnoses, key comorbidities, and suicide and intentional self-inflicted injury are associated with increased health care costs and resource use. Special attention should be given to these factors, when present. (C) 2014 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine

TI What is the Incidence of Suicide in Patients with Bone and Soft Tissue

ID PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS; SURVIVORS; IDEATION; SARCOMA; ADULTS; RISK; LIFE
AB Background Patients with cancer in the United States are estimated to have a suicide incidence that is approximately twice that of the general population. Patients with bone and soft tissue cancer often have physical impairments and activity limitations develop that reduce their quality of life, which may put them at high risk for depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. To our knowledge, there have been no large studies determining incidence of suicide among patients with bone and soft tissue cancer; this information might allow screening of certain high-risk groups.
   Questions/Purposes To determine (1) the incidence of suicide in patients with bone and soft tissue cancer, (2) whether the incidence of suicide is greater in patients with bone and soft tissue cancer than it is in the general US population, and (3) any demographic and tumor characteristics associated with increased suicide incidence.
   Methods A retrospective analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program was performed. A total of 23,620 patients with primary bone and soft tissue cancer were identified in this database from 1973 and 2013. Patients with a cause of death listed as "suicide and self-inflicted injury" were considered to have committed suicide and suicide incidences were determined for different demographic and tumor characteristics in this subset of patients. Patient data for age, gender, race, marital status, year of diagnosis, primary cancer site, cancer stage, course of treatment, and survival time were collected and analyzed. The incidence of suicide in patients with bone and soft tissue sarcoma was compared with the age-, gender-, and race-adjusted incidence of suicide in the general US population from 1970 to 2013 available from the National Center for Health Statistics through the SEER Program.
   Results The overall suicide incidence in this population was 32 per 100,000 person-years, which was higher than the age-, race-, and gender-adjusted US general population suicide incidence of 13 per 100,000 person-years. When compared with the incidence of suicide in matched subgroups of the general US population, a higher suicide incidence was observed in men (standardized mortality ratio [SMR], 2.49; 95% CI, 1.92-3.22; p < 0.001), patients of white race (SMR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.94-3.56; p < 0.001), patients 21 to 30 years old (SMR, 4.40; 95% CI, 3.44-5.54; p < 0.001) and 61 to 70 years old (SMR, 3.27; 95% CI, 2.54-4.18; p < 0.001), patients with cancer of the vertebral column (SMR, 2.88; 95% CI, 2.13-3.83; p < 0.001) and pelvic bones (SMR, 2.75; 95% CI, 2.00-3.65; p < 0.001), and patients within the first 5 years of cancer diagnosis (SMR, 10.8; 95% CI, 9.19-12.61; p < 0.001).
   Conclusions With identification of these characteristics that are associated with higher incidence of suicide, physicians should consider screening patients possessing these traits. By identifying at-risk patients, we can hope to reduce the incidence of suicide in this population by providing the treatment that these patients need. Further research must be done to determine how best to screen these patients and to identify the best interventions to reduce suicide incidence.

AB Despite many efforts at the state, city, and national levels over the past 70 years, a nationwide consensus on how best to identify, review, and prevent maternal deaths remains challenging. We present a brief history of maternal death surveillance in the United States and compare the three systems of national surveillance that exist today: the National Vital Statistics System, the Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System, and maternal mortality review committees. We discuss strategies to address the perennial challenges of shared terminology and accurate, comparable data among maternal mortality review committees. Finally, we propose that with the opportunity presented by a systematized shared data system that can accurately account for all maternal deaths, state and local-level maternal mortality review committees could become the gold standard for understanding the true burden of maternal mortality at the national level.

AB Objective To describe the trends in suicide and emergency department (ED) visits for self-harm in youth by immigration status and immigrant characteristics.
   Design Population-based longitudinal cohort study from 1996 to 2012 using linked health and administrative datasets.
   Setting Ontario, Canada.
   Participants Youth 10 to 24 years, living in Ontario, Canada.
   Exposure The main exposure was immigrant status (recent immigrant (RI) versus long-term residents (LTR)). Secondary exposures included region of birth, duration or residence, and refugee status.
   Main outcome measure Trends over time in suicide and ED self-harm were modelled within consecutive 3-year time periods. Rate ratios were estimated using Poisson regression models.
   Results 2.5 to 2.9 million individuals were included per cohort period. LTR suicide rates ranged from 7.4 to 9.4/100 000 male person-years versus 2.2-3.4/100 000 females. RI's suicide rates were 2.7-7.2/100,000 male versus 1.9-2.7/100 000 female person-years. Suicide rates were lower among RI compared with LTR (adjusted relative rate (aRR)=0.70, 95% CI=0.57 to 0.85) with different mechanisms of suicide. No significant time trend in suicide rates was observed (p=0.40). ED self-harm rates for LTR and RI were highest in females (2.6-3.4/1000 LTR females versus 1.1-1.5/1000 males, 1.2-1.8/1000 RI females versus 0.4-0.6/1000 males). RI had lower rates of self-harm compared with LTR (aRR=0.60, 95% CI=0.56 to 0.65). Stratum-specific rates showed a steeper decline per period in RI compared with LTR (RI: aRR=0.85, 95% CI=0.81 to 0.89; LTR: aRR=0.91, 95% CI=0.90 to 0.93). Observed trends were not universal across region of origin and by refugee status.
   Interpretation Suicide rates have been stable and ED self-harm rates are declining over time among RI youth. These trends by important subgroups should continue to be monitored to allow for early identification of subpopulations of immigrant youth in need of targeted and culturally appropriate public health interventions.

TI Mental Health Surveillance Among Children - United States, 2005-2011
SO MMWR-MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY WEEKLY REPORT
LA English
DT Article
AB Mental disorders among children are described as "serious deviations from expected cognitive, social, and emotional development" (US Department of Health and Human Services Health Resources and Services Administration, Maternal and Child Health Bureau. Mental health: A report of the Surgeon General. Rockville, MD: US Department of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Center for Mental Health Services, and National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Mental Health; 1999). These disorders are an important public health issue in the United States because of their prevalence, early onset, and impact on the child, family, and community, with an estimated total annual cost of $247 billion. A total of 13%-20% of children living in the United States experience a mental disorder in a given year, and surveillance during 1994-2011 has shown the prevalence of these conditions to be increasing. Suicide, which can result from the interaction of mental disorders and other factors, was the second leading cause of death among children aged 12-17 years in 2010. Surveillance efforts are critical for documenting the impact of mental disorders and for informing policy, prevention, and resource allocation. This report summarizes information about ongoing federal surveillance systems that can provide estimates of the prevalence of mental disorders and indicators of mental health among children living in the United States, presents estimates of childhood mental disorders and indicators from these systems during 2005-2011, explains limitations, and identifies gaps in information while presenting strategies to bridge those gaps.
   Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (6.8%) was the most prevalent parent-reported current diagnosis among children aged 3-17 years, followed by behavioral or conduct problems (3.5%), anxiety (3.0%), depression (2.1%), autism spectrum disorders (1.1%), and Tourette syndrome (0.2% among children aged 6-17 years). An estimated 4.7% of adolescents aged 12-17 years reported an illicit drug use disorder in the past year, 4.2% had an alcohol abuse disorder in the past year, and 2.8% had cigarette dependence in the past month. The overall suicide rate for persons aged 10-19 years was 4.5 suicides per 100,000 persons in 2010. Approximately 8% of adolescents aged 12-17 years reported >= 14 mentally unhealthy days in the past month.
   Future surveillance of mental disorders among children should include standard case definitions of mental disorders to ensure comparability and reliability of estimates across surveillance systems, better document the prevalence of mental disorders among preschool-age children, and include additional conditions such as specific anxiety disorders and bipolar disorder. Standard surveillance case definitions are needed to reliably categorize and count mental disorders among surveillance systems, which will provide a more complete picture of the prevalence of mental disorders among children. More comprehensive surveillance is needed to develop a public health approach that will both help prevent mental disorders and promote mental health among children.

AB The Texas Legislature in 1993 mandated a quarterly reporting requirement for hospitals and physicians performing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the state (United States Government hospitals were excluded). The Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation (TDMHMR) was designated as the agency responsible for collecting and maintaining the data. This paper reviews the ECT data from 16 quarterly reports (09/01/93 through 08/31/97). The reports contained data on 41,660 ECT treatments in approximately 5971 patients. The results of this study support the proposition that ECT is an extremely safe and effective treatment for those individuals suffering from a serious mental illness. In Texas, ethnic groups other than non-Hispanic Anglo-Americans appear to be underserved in regards to ECT. Those patients without appropriate insurance or adequate personal funds are also underserved as a result of the few county and state hospitals performing ECT and the relatively small number of patients treated with ECT at those hospitals. Recommendations are suggested to improve the quality of the database and in informing the public as to the safety and efficacy of this valuable treatment modality.
   What, at first, was seen as an unwarranted legislative foray into the practice of medicine, has, in the end, become a source of valuable data supporting the use of ECT as an important treatment modality.

AB IMPORTANCE Since 2004, the suicide rate among US Army soldiers has exceeded the rate of death from combat injury. It is critical to establish factors that increase the risk of acting on suicidal thoughts to guide early intervention and suicide prevention.
   OBJECTIVE To assess whether firearm ownership, use, storage practices, and accessibility are associated with increased risk of suicide.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this case-control study, suicide cases (n = 135) were defined as US Army soldiers who died by suicide while on active duty between August 1, 2011, and November 1, 2013. Next-of-kin and Army supervisors of soldiers who died by suicide (n = 168) were compared with propensity-matched controls (n = 137); those soldiers with a suicidal ideation in the past year (n = 118) provided structured interview data. Data were analyzed from April 5, 2018, to April 2, 2019.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Firearm ownership, storage, and accessibility were assessed by using items from the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview screening scales along with items created for the purpose of the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) study.
   RESULTS Among the 135 suicide decedents, next-of-kin reported that they had greater accessibility to firearms compared with propensity-matched controls. Specifically, suicide decedents were more likely to own 1 or more handguns compared with propensity-matched controls (odds ratio [OR], 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0-3.7; chi(2)(1) = 4.2; false discovery rate [FDR] P = .08), store a loaded gun at home (OR, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.9-9.1; chi(2)(1) = 12.2; FDR P = .003), and publicly carry a gun when not required for military duty (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.4-7.3; chi(2)(1) = 7.4; FDR P = .02). The combination of these 3 items was associated with a 3-fold increase in the odds of suicide death (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.2-9.4; chi(2)(1) = 5.4; FDR P = .05). Storing a loaded gun with ammunition at home or publicly carrying a gun when not on duty was associated with a 4-fold increase in the odds of suicide death (OR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.9-7.9; chi(2)(1) = 14.1; FDR P = .002).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, in addition to gun ownership, ease and immediacy of firearm access were associated with increased suicide risk. Discussion with family members and supervisors about limiting firearm accessibility should be evaluated for potential intervention.

AB Purpose To estimate the number of acetaminophen overdose-related emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations in the United States, characterize these by intentionality, age, and gender, and compare the strengths and limitations of the utilized databases.
   Methods We used data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) to estimate the number of relevant ED visits in the United States between 2000 and 2007, and the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS) to estimate the number of relevant hospitalizations in the United States between 1991 and 2006. National estimates and their standard errors were calculated using information provided in each database. We used the standard United States population in 2000 to calculate age-adjusted rates.
   Results We estimate an annual average of 44 348 (NHAMCS, 2000-2007) or 78 414 (NEISS, 2006-2007) acetaminophen overdose-related ED visits and 33 520 (NHDS, 2000-2006) hospitalizations. For 2000-2006 we calculated an age-adjusted rate of 13.9 acetaminophen overdose-related hospitalizations per 100 000 US population, with the highest rate (15.7) occurring from 2005 to 2006. Between 1991 and 2006, there was no decrease noted in hospitalizations for intentional or unintentional overdoses. The majority of overdoses reported in NEISS (69.8%) and NHDS (74.2%) were classified as intentional (suicides or suicidal gestures), whereas in NHAMCS, intentionality was evenly distributed.
   Conclusions Our results suggest that acetaminophen overdose, both intentional and unintentional, remains a significant public health concern. With an understanding of their methodological characteristics and limitations, these national databases can be useful tools to characterize acetaminophen overdose-related ED visits and hospitalizations.

AB Study Objectives: Sleep disturbances are common in United States military personnel. Despite their exposure to combat and trauma, little is known about nightmares in this population. The purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence and associated clinical and polysomnographic characteristics of nightmares in United States military personnel with sleep disturbances.
   Methods: Retrospective review of 500 active duty United States military personnel who underwent a sleep medicine evaluation and polysomnography at our sleep center. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index-Addendum were used to characterize clinically significant nightmares. Subjective and objective sleep attributes were compared between groups.
   Results: At least weekly nightmares were present in 31.2%; yet, only 3.9% reported nightmares as a reason for evaluation. Trauma-related nightmares occurred in 60% of those patients with nightmares. Patients with nightmares had increased sleep onset latency (SOL) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency (mean SOL/REM sleep latency 16.6/145 minutes, P =.02 and P =.01 respectively) compared to those without (mean SOL/REM sleep latency 12.5/126 minutes). The comorbid disorders of depression (P =.01, relative risk [RR] 3.55 [95% CI, 2.52-4.98]), anxiety (P =.01, RR 2.57 [95% CI, 1.93-3.44]), posttraumatic stress disorder (P =.01, RR 5.11 [95% CI, 3.43-7.62]), and insomnia (P =.01, RR 1.59 [95% CI, 1.42-1.79]) were all associated with nightmares.
   Conclusions: Clinically significant nightmares are highly prevalent in United States military personnel with sleep disturbances. Nightmares are associated with both subjective and objective sleep disturbances and are frequently comorbid with other sleep and mental health disorders.

AB Suicide is ranked as the tenth leading cause of death for all ages in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012). Joiner's (2005) interpersonal theory of suicide stated thwarted belongingnessthe feeling of being alienated from othersand perceived burdensomenessthe feeling of being a liability to othersare the primary proximal factors leading to suicidal desire. The current study focused on thwarted belongingness and examined its relationship to face-to-face interactions and online interactions in both an undergraduate and community sample. We hypothesized that negative face-to-face and online interactions would be independently associated with higher levels of thwarted belongingness. Furthermore, we hypothesized that face-to-face interactions would moderate the relationship between online interactions and thwarted belongingness and that online interactions would moderate the relationship between face-to-face interactions and thwarted belongingness. Three hundred eighty-seven participants (79.6% female) at a southern university and 209 (62.7% male) participants recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk website completed an online survey. Results only partially supported hypotheses, with only face-to-face interactions shown to be independently related to higher levels of thwarted belongingness. These findings indicated that negative face-to-face interactions may contribute to higher levels of risk factors for suicide ideation and highlighted the importance of assessing for negative interactions across all contexts.

AB Background Identifying brain activity patterns that are associated with suicidal ideation (SI) may help to elucidate its pathogenesis and etiology. Suicide poses a significant public health problem, and SI is a risk factor for suicidal behavior. Methods Forty-one unmedicated adult participants in a major depressive episode (MDE), 26 with SI on the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation and 15 without SI, underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning. Twenty-one healthy volunteers (HVs) were scanned for secondary analyses. Whole brain analysis of both amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFFs) and fractional ALFF was performed in MDE subjects to identify regions where activity was associated with SI. Results Subjects with SI had greater ALFF than those without SI in two clusters: one in the right hippocampus and one in the thalamus and caudate, bilaterally. Multi-voxel pattern analysis distinguished between those with and without SI. Post hoc analysis of the mean ALFF in the hippocampus cluster found it to be associated with a delayed recall on the Buschke memory task. Mean ALFF from the significant clusters was not associated with depression severity and did not differ between MDE and HV groups. Discussion These results indicate that SI is associated with altered resting-state brain activity. The pattern of elevated activity in the hippocampus may be related to how memories are processed.

AB Background: Patient-centered decision making, which in the United States is typically considered to be appropriate, may not be universally endorsed, thereby harboring the potential to complicate the care of patients from other cultural backgrounds in potentially unrecognized ways. This study compares the attitudes toward ethical decision making and autonomy issues among academic and community physicians and patients of medical center outpatient clinics in Japan and the United States.
   Methods: A questionnaire requesting judgments about seven clinical vignettes was distributed (in English or Japanese) to sample groups of Japanese physicians (n = 400) and patients (n = 65) as well as US physicians (n = 120) and patients (n = 60) that were selected randomly from academic institutions and community settings in Japan (Tokyo and the surrounding area) and the United States (the Stanford/Palo Alto, CA, area). Responses were obtained from 273 Japanese physicians (68%), 58 Japanese patients (89%), 98 US physicians (82%), and 55 US patients (92%). Physician and patient sample groups were compared on individual items, and composite scores were derived from subsets of items relevant to patient autonomy, family authority, and physician authority.
   Results: A majority of both US physicians and patients, but only a minority of Japanese physicians and patients, agreed that a patient should be informed of an incurable cancer diagnosis before their family is informed and that a terminally ill patient wishing to die immediately should not be ventilated, even if both the doctor and the patient's family want the patient ventilated (Japanese physicians and patients vs US physicians and patients, p < 0.001). A majority of respondents in both Japanese sample groups, but only a minority in both US sample groups, agreed that a patient's family should be informed of an incurable cancer diagnosis before the patient is informed and that the family of an HIV-positive patient should be informed of this disease status despite the patient's opposition to such disclosure (Japanese physicians and patients vs US physicians and patients, p < 0.001). Physicians in both Japan and the United States were less likely than patients in their respective countries to agree with physician assistance in the suicide of a terminally ill patient (Japanese physicians and patients vs US physicians and patients, p < 0.05). Across various clinical scenarios, all four respondent groups accorded greatest authority to the patient, less to the family, and still less to the physician when the views of these persons conflicted. Japanese physicians and patients, however, relied more on family and physician authority and placed less emphasis on patient autonomy than the US physicians and patients sampled. Younger respondents placed less emphasis on family and physician authority.
   Conclusions: Family and physician opinions are accorded a larger role in clinical decision making by the Japanese physicians and patients sampled than by those in the United States, although both cultures place a greater emphasis on patient preferences than on the preferences of the family or physician. Our results are consistent with the view that cultural context shapes the relationship of the patient, the physician, and the patient's family in medical decision making. The results emphasize the need for clinicians to be aware of these issues that may affect patient and family responses in different clinical situations, potentially affecting patient satisfaction and compliance with therapy.

TI Extracting psychiatric stressors for suicide from social media using

SO BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING
LA English

DE Suicide; Mental health; Psychiatric stressors; Social media; Deep
   learning; Named entity recognition
AB Background: Suicide has been one of the leading causes of deaths in the United States. One major cause of suicide is psychiatric stressors. The detection of psychiatric stressors in an at risk population will facilitate the early prevention of suicidal behaviors and suicide. In recent years, the widespread popularity and real-time information sharing flow of social media allow potential early intervention in a large-scale population. However, few automated approaches have been proposed to extract psychiatric stressors from Twitter. The goal of this study was to investigate techniques for recognizing suicide related psychiatric stressors from Twitter using deep learning based
   methods and transfer learning strategy which leverages an existing annotation dataset from clinical text. Methods: First, a dataset of suicide-related tweets was collected from Twitter streaming data with a multiple-step pipeline including keyword-based retrieving, filtering and further refining using an automated binary classifier. Specifically, a convolutional neural networks (CNN) based algorithm was used to build the binary classifier. Next, psychiatric stressors were annotated in the suicide-related tweets. The stressor recognition problem is conceptualized as a typical named entity recognition (NER) task and tackled using recurrent neural networks (RNN) based methods. Moreover, to reduce the annotation cost and improve the performance, transfer learning strategy was adopted by leveraging existing annotation from clinical text.
   Results & conclusions: To our best knowledge, this is the first effort to extract psychiatric stressors from Twitter data using deep learning based approaches. Comparison to traditional machine learning algorithms shows the superiority of deep learning based approaches. CNN is leading the performance at identifying suicide-related tweets with a precision of 78% and an F-1 measure of 83%, outperforming Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extra Trees (ET), etc. RNN based psychiatric stressors recognition obtains the best F-1 measure of 53.25% by exact match and 67. 94% by inexact match, outperforming Conditional Random Fields (CRF). Moreover, transfer learning from clinical notes for the Twitter corpus outperforms the training with Twitter corpus only with an F-1 measure of 54.9% by exact match. The results indicate the advantages of deep learning based methods for the automated stressors recognition from social media.

AB Bullying and stalking through cyberspace have become serious phenomena in the Internet era, impacting mainly young users and teenagers. Many tragic incidents have occurred, especially in the West, including self-harm and suicide due to these problems. To protect the victims many countries such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK) and Canada have codified laws dealing with cyber-crimes, including cyber-harassment. To determine the adequacy of such laws in addressing these issues, we present in this paper a legal analysis of the existing anti-bullying and stalking laws in the UAE, US, UK, and Canada. The purpose is to gain perspective on the characteristics of the laws and their ability to protect society from various forms of crimes associated with cyberbullying and cyberstalking. The paper also presents recommendations to help combat cyberbullying and cyberstalking and protect our youth from these issues.

AB Objective: Self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs) are a major public health problem that traditional interventions have been unable to address on a large scale. The goal of this series of studies was to take initial steps toward developing an effective SITB treatment that can be easily delivered on a very large scale. Method: We created a brief (1-2 min), game-like app called Therapeutic Evaluative Conditioning (TEC), designed to increase aversion to SITBs and decrease aversion to the self. In 3 separate studies, we recruited participants with recent and severe histories of SITBs from web forums focused on self-injury and psychopathology (Ns = 114, 131, and 163) and randomly assigned them to receive access to the mobile treatment TEC app or a control app for 1 month. We tested the effect of TEC on the frequency of self-cutting, nonsuicidal self-injury more generally, suicide ideation, suicide plans, and suicidal behaviors. Results: Analyses showed that, compared with the control app, TEC produced moderate reductions for all SITBs except suicide ideation. Across studies, the largest and most consistent reductions were for self-cutting episodes (32%-40%), suicide plans (21%-59%), and suicidal behaviors (33%-77%). Two of the 3 studies showed that TEC impacted its intended treatment targets and that greater change in these targets was associated with greater SITB reductions. TEC effects were not maintained at the 1-month posttreatment follow-up. Conclusions: Future versions of brief, mobile interventions like that tested here may have the potential to reduce SITBs and related behaviors on a large scale.

AB Purpose This study examined the prevalence of suicidal ideation and past suicide attempt in adult survivors of childhood cancer and investigated the relationship of suicidal symptoms to cancer treatment and current health. The hypothesis that poor physical health would be significantly associated with suicidality after adjusting for mental health variables was specifically tested.
   Methods Two hundred twenty-six adult survivors of childhood cancer (mean age, 28 years) seen in a survivor clinic completed the Short Form-36 and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), as well as suicide items from the Symptom Checklist-90 Revised, and Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation. Participants reporting current suicide ideation or any past suicide attempt were classified as suicidal.
   Results Twenty-nine participants (12.83%) reported suicidality, although only 11 of these were significantly depressed by BDI criteria. Univariate analyses found suicidality unrelated to age or sex but positively associated with younger age at diagnosis, longer time since diagnosis, cranial radiation treatment, leukemia diagnosis, depression, hopelessness, pain, and physical appearance concern. A hierarchical logistic regression showed that current physical functioning, including pain, was significantly associated with suicidality even after adjusting for treatment and depression variables.
   Conclusion Suicidal symptoms, which are reported by a significant minority of adult survivors of childhood cancer, are related to cancer treatments and post-treatment mental and physical health. Association of suicidal symptoms with physical health problems is important because these represent treatable conditions for which survivors may seek follow-up care. The relationship of physical well-being to suicidality underscores the need for a multidisciplinary approach to survivor care.

ID HOMICIDE; HANDGUNS
AB Research on the role of firearms in violence andfatal events has focused heavily on American data and research. This, implies certain limitations, since the United States is one of the Western countries with exceptionally high homicide and gun ownership rates. Thus, the American context offers only limited variance in the most prominent independent as well as dependent variables.
   International comparisons offer challenging new perspectives. This research is based on data on gun availability in private households, collected through the international victimization surveys of 1989, 1992, and 1996, and World Health Organization data on homicide and suicide from 21 countries. It updates and extends former research conducted on this issue, based on the surveys of 1989 and 1992. In addition, data from the International Crime Victimization Surveys were used on total and gun-related robbery and assault (including threats).
   The results show very strong correlations between the presence of guns in the home and suicide committed with a gun, rates of gun-related homicide involving female victims, and gun-related assault. The picture is different for male homicide, total rates of assault, and generally, for robbery (committed with or without a gun). With the exception of robbery, most correlations are similar or stronger when all types of guns are considered, rather than handguns alone. Interestingly, no significant correlations with total suicide or homicide rates were found, leaving open the question of possible substitution effects. It is concluded that guns in the home are an important risk factor in suicide with guns, as well as a threat to women (especially female partners), whereas their role in homicide of male victims and street crime (such as robbery) may be much less prominent. Finally, the usual focus on handguns may lead to underestimate the role of other types of guns.

TI Euthanasia: A historical review of meanings, ideas and practices
SO ARCHIVES OF HELLENIC MEDICINE
LA Greek
DT Review
DE Bioethics; End-of-life dilemmas; Euthanasia; Suicide
ID PERSPECTIVES; SUICIDE
AB The word euthanasia first appeared during the Hellenistic era. Greek and Latin writers used it in a sense quite different from the modern usage, referring to the serene death that seals a virtuous life, the heroic death on the battlefield or for the defense of supreme ideals, the death that comes at the right time, and the non-tortuous death. In the 17th century, it was transported into English by Bacon to describe the painless death that is accomplished by the application of medical means of pain relief. In the 18th century, Eugene Voulgaris considered it to be the endurance of death with bravery and placidity. It is only at the end of the 19th century that it acquired the specific meaning with which it is used today, i.e., the active acceleration of death by medical intervention, in patients suffering from incurable, agonizing illnesses. Although not named as such, practices similar to contemporary euthanasia have been testified since antiquity (Kea, Marseilles, Sparta), while the theoretical debate on voluntary suicide in old age, disability or sickness is timeless. The Hippocratic Oath, reflecting Pythagorean beliefs, explicitly forbids euthanasia, either as the administration of a lethal substance by the physician to terminate the patient's life, or as physician-assisted suicide. Plato, Aristotle, the Christian Fathers, and Kant categorically rejected suicide, which, conversely, was supported, under certain conditions, by some of the Stoics and Hume. The demand for euthanasia, in the modern meaning of the word, emerged in the 1870s in the United States of America and England. In Germany, the Nazi regime used the term "euthanasia" euphemistically to name a eugenics program of forced killing of patients suffering from incurable illnesses, and mentally retarded, disabled, psychotic, and even elderly people.

AB Objective: Using a heuristic model of suicidal ideation and behavior, the two objectives were to identify correlates of (1) unique suicide-related outcomes (ideation, planning, planned attempt, unplanned attempt) and (2) specific transitions from one suicide-related category to the next. Method: Analyses were conducted with data from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA), a six-site family pedigree study of individuals in treatment for alcoholism, their relatives, and control families. There were 3,729 subjects in the analysis; all were age IS years or older with a diagnosis of current alcohol dependence according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised. Lifetime suicidal ideation, planning, and attempts were analyzed retrospectively. Correlates of each lifetime transition were analyzed using a series of multivariate logistic regressions. Multivariate multinomial regression analysis was used to examine correlates of each lifetime outcome. Results: Female gender is uniquely associated with transitions to unplanned and planned attempts. Independent depression and substance-induced depression are associated with transitions to ideation and planning, whereas alcohol-related aggression is correlated with transitions to unplanned attempts. Analyses of suicide-related outcomes show that women are at higher risk for unplanned and planned attempts. Substance use and impairment are related to suicidal plans and attempts but not ideation. Independent and substance-induced depressions are associated with each suicide-related outcome, whereas alcohol-related aggression is uniquely related to unplanned attempts. Conclusions: Data underscore the heterogeneity of suicidal ideation and behavior among alcoholics and indicate the need to make clear distinctions between types of suicidal ideation and behavior in research and prevention efforts.

AB Background and objective This project links population data to the Wisconsin Violent Death Reporting System (WVDRS) to determine the extent to which firearm possession criteria are being followed as well as the potential impact of the adoption of proposed possession criteria. Design and study population Criminal justice data for WVDRS homicide suspects and victims and suicide decedents 2008-2011 and a sample of matched control group of driver's license holders (to characterise the state population) will be abstracted. Methods Individual legal possession statuses (prohibited/not prohibited) under each current and expanded criterion will be determined. Proportions of interest will be calculated from two-way contingency tables, and tests between groups with categorical variables (eg, criterion is met or not) will be performed with Fisher's exact or binomial proportion tests. Tests between groups with continuous variables (eg, number of misdemeanours) will be performed by zero inflated negative binomial regression. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve will be used to quantify the prediction accuracy of specific univariate or multivariate logistic model for prediction. Inverse probability weighting will be used for analyses that extend from matched controls to the general state population of license holders. Discussion Linked data sets and partnerships are challenging, but necessary for comprehensive public health research. Results of this study will contribute knowledge on the proportion of prohibited suspects and suicide decedents that used firearms in violent deaths and, if applying expanded criteria would have increased prohibited persons. This study will also investigate risk and protective factors for being a victim of homicide.

AB Background: The aims of this study were to describe temporal patterns of injury-related mortality by sex, age group, and mechanism, and to identify changes in the leading causes of injury-related deaths in South Korea from 1996 through 2006.
   Methods: This retrospective, descriptive study analyzed national data on all injury-related deaths reported in official death certificates from 1996-2006. Incidence rates of fatal injuries are presented as crude and age-standardized rates per 100 000 population, and percentage changes in injury-related mortalities over the 11-year period were calculated with respect to intention, sex, and age. The 4 most common mechanisms (fall, poisoning, suffocation, and drowning) were then classified as unintentional injuries or suicides.
   Results: Overall injury-related mortality decreased 31.7% during the study period (1996-2006). Despite this overall decreasing trend, injury-related mortality increased among adults aged 65 years or older. In particular, injury-related mortality among women older than 80 years doubled since 1996. Suicide replaced transport as the leading cause of injury-related deaths between 2003 and 2006. With regard to intention, sex, and age, the most noticeable changes during the study period were increases in unintentional fall among elderly adults and suicidal fall among adolescents.
   Conclusions: The incidence rate for all injuries generally decreased from 1996-2006. However, the incidence rate of fall injuries increased among elderly adults, and suicide increased among adolescents. These findings suggest that further investigation of the characteristics and trends of injuries is necessary to develop and implement effective interventions.

AB Purpose: Suicide attempts by adolescents most commonly involve the overdose of medications. To date, there has been little information on the over-the-counter or prescription medicines that adolescents ingest for self-harm. Identification of medications chosen in suicide attempts may help guide anticipatory guidance to parents by primary care providers and Poison Centers in prevention programs.
   Methods: This was a retrospective observational study using the American Association of Poison Control Center's National Poison Data System. Data were collected on patients aged 13-19 years old at the time of their substance ingestion, between the years 2004 and 2013 and that were coded as reason for ingestion of "intentional-suspected suicide."
   Results: During the 10-year study period, there were 390,560 poison center calls for intentional-suspected suicide in the United States between 2004 and 2013, accounting for 80.3% of all "intentional" ingestion calls in the adolescent population. Over the entire age range, the most common substance ingested included acetaminophen (10.9%), ibuprofen (9%), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (7.7%), atypical antipsychotic (6%), and antihistamines (5%). The most common medications coded as resulting in major clinical effects or death were antidepressants and atypical antipsychotics.
   Conclusions: Adolescent ingestion choices for suicide attempts have remained relatively consistent over the past 10 years. However, there was a recent decrease in selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ingestions. The most common medications used in an overdose attempt were ibuprofen and acetaminophen. Further preventative efforts are needed in this at-risk population from multiple providers at various levels. (C) 2016 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: This study utilized the Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems (TBIMS) National Database to examine the prevalence of depression and suicidal behaviour in a large cohort of patients who sustained moderate-to-severe TBI.Method: Participants presented to a TBIMS acute care hospital within 72 hours of injury and received acute care and comprehensive rehabilitation in a TBIMS designated brain injury inpatient rehabilitation programme. Depression and suicidal ideation were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Self-reported suicide attempts during the past year were recorded at each follow-up examination, at 1, 2, 3, 10, 15 and 20 years post-injury.Results: Throughout the 20 years of follow-up, rates of depression ranged from 24.8-28.1%, suicidal ideation ranged from 7.0-10.1% and suicide attempts (past year) ranged from 0.8-1.7%. Participants who endorsed depression and/or suicidal behaviour at year 1 demonstrated consistently elevated rates of depression and suicidal behaviour 5 years after TBI.Conclusion: Compared to the general population, individuals with TBI are at greater risk for depression and suicidal behaviour many years after TBI. The significant psychiatric symptoms evidenced by individuals with TBI highlight the need for routine screening and mental health treatment in this population.

AB People recently discharged from inpatient psychiatric care are at high risk of suicide and self-harm, with 6% of all suicides in England occurring in the 3 months after discharge. There is some evidence from a randomized trial carried out in the United States in the 1960s-70s that supportive letters sent by psychiatrists to high-risk patients in the period following hospital discharge resulted in a reduction in suicide. The aim of the current pilot study was to assess the feasibility of conducting a similar trial, but in a broader group of psychiatric discharges, in the context of present day UK clinical practice. The intervention was piloted on 3 psychiatric inpatient wards in southwest England. On 2 wards a series of 8 letters were sent to patients over the 12 months after discharge and 6 letters were sent from the third ward over a 6 month period. A total of 102 patients discharged from the wards received at least 1 letter, but only 45 (44.1%) received the full series of letters. The main reasons for drop-out were patient opt-out (n=24) or readmission (n=26). In the context of a policy of intensive follow-up post-discharge, qualitative interviews with service users showed that most already felt adequately supported and the intervention added little to this. Those interviewed felt that it was possible that the intervention might benefit people new to or with little follow-up from mental health services but that fewer letters should be mailed.

AB Background: Suicide is a major public health concern, particularly among people who use illicit substances and/or non-prescribed medications.
   Methods: The present study prospectively assessed the incidence and predictors of suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempt (SA) among 868 substance-using patients over 12 months after receiving primary care within seven public primary care clinics.
   Results: Participants reported a high incidence of SI (25.9%) and SA (7.1%) over the year following primary care visits. Suicidality was elevated in patients who were female; lacked a high school diploma; were unemployed; reported depression, anxiety, hallucinations, concentration difficulty, or violent behavior; used nicotine or stimulants; used the emergency department or mental health services in the past 90 days; reported current quality-of-life impairment in mobility or usual activities; or reported recent SI or lifetime SA at baseline. In multiple regression analyses, only past 30-day SI, any lifetime SA, past 90-day violent behavior, and current impairment due to anxiety or depression at baseline uniquely predicted SI or SA beyond other variables.
   Conclusions: Results support the need for screening for suicidality among primary care patients who use illicit substances and identify key of these patients who are at particularly elevated risk for suicidality.

   SUICIDE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ATTITUDES; SEEKING; RISK
AB Objective: In response to recent mass shootings, policy makers have proposed multiple policies to prevent persons with serious mental illness from having guns. The political debate about these proposals is often uninformed by research. To address this gap, this review article summarizes the research related to gun restriction policies that focus on serious mental illness. Methods: Gun restriction policies were identified by researching the THOMAS legislative database, state legislative data-bases, prior review articles, and the news media. Pub Med, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases were searched for publications between 1970 and 2013 that addressed the relationship between serious mental illness and violence, the effectiveness of gun policies focused on serious mental illness, the potential for such policies to exacerbate negative public attitudes, and the potential for gun restriction policies to deter mental health treatment seeking. Results: Limited research suggests that federal law restricting gun possession by persons with serious mental illness may prevent gun violence from this population. Promotion of policies to prevent persons with serious mental illness from having guns does not seem to exacerbate negative public attitudes toward this group. Little is known about how restricting gun possession among persons with serious mental illness affects suicide risk or mental health treatment seeking. Conclusions: Future studies should examine how gun restriction policies for serious mental illness affect suicide, how such policies are implemented by states, how persons with serious mental illness perceive policies that restrict their possession of guns, and how gun restriction policies influence mental health treatment seeking among persons with serious mental illness.

AB BackgroundPhysical functioning indexed multimorbidity is strongly associated with long-term mortality, but its role in poor mental health has not been quantified.
   MethodsA total of 252 002 community-dwelling adults in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHS II, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) prospective cohorts reported physician-diagnosed diseases and the Short Form-36 over 8 years and had 24-year follow-up for suicide mortality. We quantified multimorbidity using a multimorbidity-weighted index (MWI). We used multivariable-adjusted proportional hazards models with competing risks for suicide mortality and mixed-effects models to estimate mental health-related quality of life (HRQOL).
   ResultsMultimorbidity was associated with an increased risk of suicide mortality in an approximately linear manner, with roughly two- to threefold higher risk in adults with the highest vs lowest quartile MWI in adjusted models: NHS hazard ratio (HR) = 3.01 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.48-6.11); NHS II HR = 3.04 (95% CI = 1.82-5.09); HPFS HR = 1.74 (95% CI = 1.08-2.81). Greater MWI was associated with worse mental HRQOL 8 years later across all scales and the mental component summary (MCS) in a dose-response manner. This association was attenuated but persisted after adjustment for baseline mental HRQOL and other covariates. Adults with the highest quartile MWI had lower MCS in adjusted models compared with those with the lowest quartile MWI: NHS ss = -0.61 (95% CI = -0.78 to -0.44); NHS II ss = -1.25 (95% CI = -1.44 to -1.06).
   ConclusionMultimorbidity is associated with substantially higher suicide mortality risk and worse mental HRQOL across all available scales, even when indexed to physical functioning. These results highlight the substantial mental health burden imposed by multimorbidity at all ages and sexes. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:511-519, 2019.

AB Objectives To examine the trends associated with child and adolescent suicidal ideation and suicide attempts and to compare these trends to those among the adult population.
   Study design A nationally representative sample of administrative billing data was used for the analysis. which included descriptive statistics, trend data, and logistic regression.
   Results There were 874 872 (95% CI, 810 574-939 169) children and adolescents and 5 561 197 (95% CI, 5 271 426-5 850 968) adults admitted to an emergency department who experienced suicidal ideation or suicide attempts between 2010 and 2014, representing 1.20% of admissions for children (95% CI, 1.13-1.37) and adolescents and 1.09% of admissions for adults (95% CI, 1.05-1.13). Children and adolescents were more likely to be female (aOR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.71-1.78) and to have private insurance (aOR, 1.75; 95% Cl. 1.68-1.83) as compared with adults. Although the percentage of admissions increased for adults 25 and older (18.95%) the greatest increases were found among children and adolescents (5-11 years of age. 37.87%; 12-14 years of age, 82.03%; 15-17 years of age, 51.59%; and 18-24 years of age, 26.77%). There is a seasonal trend for children and adolescents such that higher rates are associated with the school year, which is not present for adults.
   Conclusion Practitioners should be cognizant of the fact that suicidal ideation and suicide attempts for youth present differently than they do for the greater population and they should be vigilant in identifying risk factors. especially during seasons where risk of self-harm increases.

   DISTURBANCES; PREVALENCE
AB Objective: Links between sleep problems and suicidality have been frequently described in clinical samples; however, this issue has not been well-studied in the general population. Using data from a nationally representative survey, we examined the association between self-reported sleep difficulties and suicidality in the United States.
   Methods: The WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to assess sleep problems and suicidality in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R). Relationships between three measures of sleep (difficulty initiating sleep, maintaining sleep, early morning awaking), and suicidal thoughts, plans, and attempts were assessed in logistic regression analyses, while controlling for demographic characteristics, 12-month diagnoses of mood, anxiety and substance use disorders, and chronic health conditions.
   Results: In multivariate models, the presence of any of these sleep problems was significantly related to each measure of suicidality, including suicidal ideation (OR = 2.1), planning (OR = 2.6), and suicide attempt (OR 2.5). Early morning awakening was associated with suicidal ideation (OR = 2.0). suicide planning (OR 2.1), and suicide attempt (OR = 2.7). Difficulty initiating sleep was a significant predictor of suicidal ideation and planning (ORs: 1.9 for ideation; 2.2 for planning), while difficulty maintaining sleep during the night was a significant predictor of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts (ORs: 2.0 for ideation; 3.0 for attempt).
   Conclusions: Among community residents, chronic sleep problems are consistently associated with greater risk for suicidality. Efforts to develop comprehensive models of suicidality should consider sleep problems as potentially independent indicators of risk. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As people age, they may become more vulnerable to injury because of frailty, ill health, or dependency on others. Data from medicolegal death investigation including autopsy and statements from cases reported to 3 medicolegal units in Sri Lanka were analyzed in this study under the strict ethical framework. Of the study population, 265 were male and 75 were female. Mean age was 71.14 years. Commonest manner of death was accidental (62.1%) followed by suicide (32.1%) and homicide (5.6%). Commonest types of incidents were road traffic accidents (26.5%), falls (22.6%), and poisoning (21.2%). Among the road traffic accidents, pedestrians (77.9%) were the majority. Poisoning (59.6%) was the commonest method of suicide. The commonest weapons used in homicides were blunt weapons (47.3%). Association with alcohol was seen in more than 10% of suicidal and accidental deaths. More attention should be given to the elderly people who are using the roads while developing policies by the state. Furthermore, it is high time to think about psychological aspect in the elderly care management specially alcohol abuse and suicidal ideation among them.

TI How can one explain changes in the monthly pattern of suicide?

DE Suicide; Age; Seasonal patterns; Durkheim; Urbanization; South Korea
ID UNITED-STATES; CYCLES
AB The monthly pattern of suicides has remained a puzzle ever since it was discovered in the second half of the 19th century. In this paper we intend to "explain" not the pattern itself but rather its changes across countries and in the course of time.
   First, we show that the fairly common idea according to which this pattern is decaying in "modern" societies is not altogether true. For instance, around 2000, in well urbanized countries like South Korea or Spain this pattern was still as strong as it was in France (and other European countries) in the late 19th century.
   The method that we use in order to make some progress in our understanding is the time-honored Cartesian approach of breaking up the problem under consideration "into as many parts as might be necessary to solve it". More specifically, we try two separations of monthly suicides into simpler components: (i) according to suicide methods and (ii) according to age-groups. These separations rely on the introduction of what we call "elementary monthly profiles".
   The first separation points out the key-role of hanging and drowning. The second shows the crucial role of the 15-20 and 65+ age-groups.
   Then, we present a number of cases in which age-group decomposition provides adequate predictions. It turns out that the cases in which the predictions do not work are newly urbanized countries. The discrepancies may be due to a memory effect which induces a time-lag extending over one or two generations.
   Finally, in the light of the new results presented in the present paper, we re-examine the theory proposed by Emile Durkheim. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background. Despite an increased prevalence of depression among people of low socio-economic position, it remains unclear whether their treatment with antidepressants appropriately matches their increased need compared with people from more affluent backgrounds. This study examined socio-economic differences in antidepressant prescriptions and mortality related to depressive disorders.
   Method. A longitudinal register study of 17947 male and 47458 female local government employees with linked information on socio-economic indicators (education and occupational status) and data on antidepressant use and mortality associated with depressive disorder (suicide, alcohol-related deaths) during the years 1994 to 2000.
   Results. In men, antidepressant treatment was less common among low educational groups than among high educational groups (OR 0-87, 95 % CI 0-76-0-99) and a corresponding difference was seen between occupational statuses (OR for manual v. upper non-manual 0-72, 95 % CI 0-62-0-84). In women, socio-economic position was not associated with antidepressant use. However, both among the men and women, employees with low socio-economic position had increased risk for mental-health-related mortality, as indicated by suicides, deaths from alcohol-related causes, and all-cause mortality.
   Conclusions. These data suggest a mismatch in the treatment of depression relative to apparent clinical need, with the lowest levels of treatment concentrated in the lower socio-economic groups, despite evidence of their increased prevalence of depression and suicide.

DE adolescent; homicide; injury; motor vehicle accidents; suicide; young

AB Purpose: To compare mortality rates from motor vehicle accidents (MVA), homicide, and suicide across countries, age groups, and time.
   Methods: The World Health Organization Mortality Database was used to construct age- and gender-specific rates in 26 countries for individuals aged 15 to 34 years during the period 1955 to 1994. The rates were adjusted for differences among countries in the age-and-gender distributions of their populations. Cause-specific rates were compared by country, 4-year age groups, 8-year time blocks, and male/female ratios.
   Results: The proportion of deaths in 15-34-year-olds owing to MVA, homicide, and suicide increased from 26% to 43% over the 40-year study period. Mortality rates differ by country more than time block, peak at ages 15-29 years, and are higher in males than females. Compared to the United States, 24 countries had lower homicide rates and 23 had lower MVA-death rates.
   Conclusions: Despite declining rates of death from other causes, the rates of adolescent and young adult death from MVA, homicide, and suicide remain high in countries throughout the world. The proportion of deaths attributable to these causes increased steadily during the latter half of the 20th century. Fatal risk behaviors begin to increase during adolescence but do not peak until age 30 years, suggesting that the target population for prevention extends well beyond the teenage years.

AB Psychiatrists face complex, vexing, and often conflicting issues in assessing and managing patients with advanced medical illnesses who are determined to end their own lives. Substantial differences of opinion exist among psychiatrists regarding the roles they might take with such patients when the patients are decisionally capable and do not have clear-cut psychiatric disorders. Even those with psychiatric diagnoses often possess rational deliberative abilities and may make decisions to hasten death that are not impacted by their psychiatric disorder. How psychiatrists interact with these patients may be influenced by contradictory and even incompatible ethical, psychological, social, cultural, and professional biases. Tensions often exist between patients' autonomous preferences regarding their wish to die and psychiatrists' usual approaches to suicide prevention. To consider these issues, we review some ethical, legal, psychological, social, and clinical concerns; potential interventions; and support for psychiatrists caring for decisionally capable patients with advanced medical illness who wish to end their own lives. Although psychiatrists' work strongly focuses on suicide prevention, harms might result if suicide prevention becomes the only focus of treatment plans for these patients. We recast benefits and harms in such situations and make suggestions for assessing and managing such patients and for potentially offering assistance to families and other survivors. While psychiatrists should carefully think through each case on its own merits and seek consultation with experts, they should not act reflexively to prevent all deaths at any cost. We argue they may, in some cases, honor patients' and families' wishes and even collaborate with them around decisions to hasten death.

AB Objective: Evidence guiding suicide-prevention efforts in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) is imperative. We evaluated association between TBI and risk of death by drug overdose and firearms, including suicide and unintentional injury. Methods: Cohort study of all patients 18 years and older in Veterans Health Administration databases from October 1, 2001 to December 31, 2014 with TBI diagnosis (N = 230,200), and age-matched 1:1 to random sample of patients without TBI (N = 230,200). Results: After adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and accounting for competing risk of other deaths, hazard ratios for death by drug overdose were 1.40 (95% CI = 1.21-1.62) for mild TBI and 1.51 (95% CI = 1.31-1.74) for moderate-to-severe TBI, while hazard ratios for death by firearms were 1.09 (95% CI = 0.89-1.33) for mild TBI and 1.33 (95% CI = 1.10-1.60) for moderate-to-severe TBI. Risk of overdose death due to TBI severity was mainly observed for middle and older age groups. Conclusions: Findings suggest that veterans with mild and moderate-to-severe TBI are at increased risk of death by drug overdose and firearms, with overdose risk heightened with age. Data indicate that prevention efforts in patients with TBI include targeted means reduction.

AB When provided by a skilled, multidisciplinary team, palliative care is highly effective at addressing the physical, psychological, social, and spiritual needs of dying patients and their families. However, some patients who have witnessed harsh death want reassurance that they can escape if their suffering becomes intolerable. In addition, a small percentage of terminally ill patients receiving comprehensive care reach a point at which their suffering becomes severe and unacceptable despite unrestrained palliative efforts; some of these patients request that death be hastened. This paper presents terminal sedation and voluntary refusal of hydration and nutrition as potential last resorts that can be used to address the needs of such patients. These two practices allow clinicians to address a much wider range of intractable end-of-life suffering than physician-assisted suicide (even if it were legal) and can also provide alternatives for patients, families, and clinicians who are morally opposed to physician-assisted suicide. This paper will define the two practices, distinguish them from more standard palliative care interventions and from physician-assisted suicide, illustrate them with a real clinical scenario, provide potential guidelines and practicalities, and explore their moral and legal status. Although medicine cannot sanitize dying or provide perfect answers for all challenging end-of-life clinical problems, terminal sedation and voluntary refusal of hydration and nutrition substantially increase patients' choices at this inherently challenging time.

AB Study Objectives: Suicide in the adolescent population is a tragic and preventable cause of death. Previous studies have confirmed both long and short total sleep times (TSTs) are associated with suicidal ideation in the adult population. We hypothesized that both long and short TSTs are risk factors for serious suicide attempt in the adolescent population as well.
   Methods: We tested this hypothesis using the Youth Risk Behavior Surveys from 2007 and 2009, which consist of school-based, nationally representative samples (N = 12,154 for 2007, N = 14,782 for 2009). Logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between suicidality and sleep after adjusting for confounders including age, sex, race/ethnicity, feelings of sadness, and substance abuse.
   Results: Of the total sample, roughly 15% reported suicidal ideation, 10% planned suicide, 5% attempted and 2% reported an attempt requiring treatment. Teens who reported sleeping <= 5 or >= 10 h had a significantly higher risk for suicidality compared to those with a TST of 8 h. The largest odds ratios were found among the most severe forms of suicidality (attempt requiring treatment) with an odds ratio of 5.9 for a TST <= 4 h and 4.7 for a TST >= 10 h.
   Conclusion: Both short and long TSTs are risk factors for suicidality among teens and extremes in TST may indicate more serious suicidality. Self-reported sleep duration may be a useful screening question for suicide risk. Future studies should examine whether sleep duration is a causal and/or modifiable risk factor for suicidality in teens.

AB Background: Approximately 10% of severely obese bariatric-surgery-seeking individuals report a lifetime history of suicide attempts, a higher rate than in the general community. Being overweight is associated with weight-related stigma, making an individual more vulnerable to social isolation, a potential risk factor for suicidal ideation and/or behavior. Aims: In this cross-sectional study of surgery-seeking adults with severe obesity, we examined whether weight-related stigma increases (1) the likelihood of suicidal ideation and/or behavior or (2) the degree of loneliness; and whether hypotheses (1) and (2) are supported (3) if loneliness mediates the effect of weight-related stigma on suicidal ideation and/or behavior. Methods: Online questionnaires were administered to 301 women and 95 men seeking bariatric surgery. Results: Approximately 30.3% reported having at least a passing thought of suicide, and 5.55% a suicide attempt during their lifetime. The suicide attempt rate appears lower than other bariatric surgery samples, but possibly higher than community and other surgery sample rates. For severely obese surgery-seeking women, weight-related stigma was associated with suicidal ideation and/or behavior, though this was not mediated by loneliness. Conclusions: Future studies are needed to model and compare suicidal ideation and/or behavior in bariatric-surgery-seeking individuals and control groups.

AB In early April 2018, Dr. Maria Oquendo, President of the American Psychiatric Association, and Dr. Nora Volkow, Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, published a thought-provoking article in the New England Journal of Medicine about the role of suicide in the opioid overdose epidemic, referring to the relationship between them as a "hidden tragedy.'' Drs. Oquendo and Volkow drew our attention to the twinning of the opioid (and other drug) overdose and suicide epidemics, but these are not the first or only drug-related "twin epidemics.'' Numerous other related conditions, including pain disorders, adverse childhood experiences, posttraumatic stress disorders, HIV/AIDS, polydrug use and toxicity, and certain social determinants of health, may interact in a multiplicative and/or cumulative manner to adversely impact individuals and populations. Syndemic theory (Singer, 2009; Singer, Bulled, Ostrach, & Mendenhall, 2017) can be helpful for describing how certain conditions cluster and interact synergistically to exacerbate health effects, problem severity, and disease progression. This column argues that the opioid crisis can accurately be considered not only a singular epidemic, or even a singular syndemic when twinned with a suicide epidemic, but also a complex phenomenon that consists of multiple, related syndemic conditions in addition to suicide. These are multidimensional disorders, with multiple, often overlapping etiologies, so single-minded approaches will be ineffective. Consideration of syndemic interactions and their cumulative and multiplicative effects are helpful for guiding treatment and prognosis for individuals, and program planning and health policy for population health (Singer et al., 2017).

ID DISTRESS AMPLIFICATION MODEL; COGNITIVE CONCERNS; DISORDERS; INVENTORY;
   IDEATION; EFFICACY
AB Background: The suicide rate in the Unites States continues to increase suggesting novel intervention strategies are needed. Anxiety sensitivity (AS), or a fear of anxiety-related sensations, is a suicide risk factor that can be ameliorated via a single-session, computerized intervention called the Cognitive Anxiety Sensitivity Treatment (CAST). Results from randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that reductions in suicidal ideation (SI) due to CAST were mediated by AS reductions. However, a more detailed analysis of the mechanisms of SI reduction due to AS interventions is needed to further our understanding of theoretical models of AS and suicide, and to refine AS treatments.
   Methods: Participants (N = 74) with co-occurring anxiety pathology and SI were randomized to a single-session computerized treatment (CAST + cognitive bias modification) or a control intervention. Assessments were conducted immediately post treatment, and at 1 month and 4 month follow-ups.
   Results: Chained mediation models revealed significant reductions in SI (month 4 follow-up) through AS (post-treatment) and subsequently anxiety symptoms (month 1 follow-up), but not depressive symptoms. There were no direct mediation effects through either AS or anxiety or depressive symptoms.
   Limitations: Limitations include self-report assessment of symptoms, a sample of only individuals with a diagnosed anxiety pathology, and exploratory nature of anxiety/depression dimension analyses.
   Conclusions: Results of the current study help clarify the mechanistic pathways of SI reduction due to an AS intervention, and suggest future work attempting to increase the efficacy of AS interventions should consider the potentially important role of downstream mechanisms that follow AS reduction.

ID NETWORKING SITES; TWITTER
AB Introduction:Suicide is a significant public health problem among teenagers and young adults in the United States, placing significant stress on emergency departments (EDs) to effectively screen and assess for the presence of suicidality in a rapid yet efficient manner.Methods:A literature search was performed using PubMed and MEDLINE with the following terms: Social media, Suicide, Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, Snapchat, Ethics, Digital Media, and Forums and Blog. Data were extracted from each article, specifically the sample size, study setting, and design. Only English-language studies were included. We reviewed the reference lists of included articles for additional studies, as well. Abstracts, unpublished data, and duplicate articles were excluded.Results:A total of 363 articles met our initial criteria. Studies older than 10 years and/or in a language other than English were removed. After review, a total of 31 peer-reviewed articles were included in the study. Teenagers and young adults often fail to disclose risk factors to physicians, despite sharing them with the public on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. Therefore, physician access to a patient's social media can assist in identifying suicidal ideation and/or acts.Conclusions:Viewing a patient's social media accounts can help ED physicians gain perspective into his or her mental health status and identify those at risk for suicide; however, ethical and privacy concerns associated with this method of data gathering make implementation of such a practice controversial. To justify its use, formal prospective studies analyzing if and how physician access to a patient's social media influences care should be performed.

AB Objective: Mortality risk is relatively high in young people with asthma, and the risk may include causes of death other than those directly linked to respiratory disease. The authors investigated the association between asthma and suicide mortality in a large population-based cohort of young people.
   Method: A total of 162,766 high school students 11 to 16 years of age living in a catchment area in Taiwan from October 1995 to June 1996 were enrolled in a study of asthma and allergy. Each student and his or her parents completed structured questionnaires. Participants were classified into three groups at baseline: current asthma (symptoms present in the past year), previous asthma (history of asthma but no symptoms in the past year), and no asthma. Participants were followed to December 2007 by record linkage to the national Death Certification System. Cox proportional hazards models were used to study the association between asthma and cause of death.
   Results: The incidence rate of suicide mortality in participants with current asthma at baseline was more than twice that of those without asthma (11.0 compared with 4.3 per 100,000 person-years), but there was no significant difference in the incidence of natural deaths. The adjusted hazard ratio for suicide was 2.26 (95% CI=1.43-3.58) in the current asthma group and 1.76 (95% CI=0.90-3.43) in the previous asthma group. Having a greater number of asthma symptoms at baseline was associated with a higher risk of subsequent suicide. The population attributable fraction was 7.0%.
   Conclusions: These results highlight evidence of excess suicide mortality in young people with asthma. There is a need to improve mental health care for young people, particularly those with more severe and persistent asthma symptoms.

AB OBJECTIVE. We examined the cross-sectional associations between reports of an early age of alcohol use initiation and suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and peer and dating violence victimization and perpetration among high-risk adolescents.
   METHOD. Data were obtained from the Youth Violence Survey conducted in 2004 and administered to all public school students enrolled in grades 7, 9, and 11/12 (N = 4131) in a high-risk school district in the United States. Our analyses were limited to seventh-grade students who either began drinking before the age of 13 or were nondrinkers, with complete information on all covariates (n = 856). Cross-sectional logistic and multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the associations between early alcohol use and each of the 6 outcome behaviors (dating violence victimization and perpetration, peer violence victimization and perpetration, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts) while controlling for demographic characteristics and other potential confounders (ie, heavy episodic drinking, substance use, peer drinking, depression, impulsivity, peer delinquency, and parental monitoring).
   RESULTS. In our study, 35% of students reported alcohol use initiation before 13 years of age (preteen alcohol use initiators). Students who reported preteen alcohol use initiation reported involvement in significantly more types of violent behaviors (mean: 2.8 behaviors), compared with nondrinkers (mean: 1.8 behaviors). Preteen alcohol use initiation was associated significantly with suicide attempts, relative to nondrinkers, controlling for demographic characteristics and all other potential confounders.
   CONCLUSIONS. Early alcohol use is an important risk factor for involvement in violent behaviors and suicide attempts among youths. Increased efforts to delay and to reduce early alcohol use among youths are needed and may reduce both violence and suicide attempts.

ID SODIUM THIOSULFATE; HYDROXOCOBALAMIN
AB Over 200 000 persons of Hmong ethnicity live in the United States. The majority of this Southeast Asian ethnic group live in California, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Tradition plays a strong role in the Hmong population, and difficulty in assimilation into "Western ways" has been reported to result in depression and suicide attempts. Some products sold at Southeast Asian ethnic markets are well-known within the Hmong community to be lethal but are essentially unknown to the outside community. We describe eight cases in which cyanide-containing products were ingested by Hmong patients. Seven cases were suicide attempts involving the ingestion of a locally-purchased substance intended for cleaning metal, coins, or jewelry. One case involved the fatal ingestion of a cyanide-containing "herbal" cure. In the majority of the cases, cyanide was not initially suspected, and treatment was delayed due to lack of information regarding the product ingested. In the two patients who survived, the cyanide antidote kit (sodium nitrite, amyl nitrite, and sodium thiosulfate) was administered early. Clinicians should be aware that unusual and potentially lethal products are easily available at ethnic markets. Cyanide toxicity should be suspected, and empiric antidote therapy initiated early, in patients of Hmong or Southeast Asian descent who present with sudden and unexplained cardiovascular collapse and metabolic acidosis, especially in the setting of a suspected suicidal ingestion.

ID UNITED-STATES
AB Understanding the life years lost by assault and suicide due to firearms among white and black Americans can help us understand the race-specific and intent-specific firearm mortality burden and inform prevention programmes. The objective was to assess national and race-specific life expectancy loss related to firearms in the USA due to assault and suicide. We used firearm mortality data available from Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research to calculate the life expectancy loss between 2000 and 2016 separately for assaults and suicides among white and black Americans. The total national life expectancy loss due to firearms was 2.48 (2.23 whites, 4.14 blacks) years. The total life expectancy loss in years due to firearm assault was 0.95 (0.51 whites, 3.41 blacks) and suicide was 1.43 (1.62 whites, 0.60 blacks), respectively. Firearm life expectancy loss in years at birth, 20, 40 and 60 years of age was 0.29 (0.22 whites, 0.56 blacks), 0.25 (0.21 whites, 0.47 blacks), 0.09 (0.10 whites, 0.08 blacks) and 0.03 (0.03 whites, 0.01 blacks) years. National firearm life expectancy loss in days from 20 to 60 years declined by 79.5 (65.8 whites, 166.3 blacks); for assault by 37.5 (18.9 whites, 141.0 blacks) and suicides by 38.7 (43.9 whites, 20.3 blacks). Americans lose substantial years of life due to firearm injury. This loss in life years is characterised by a large racial gap by age and intent. Tailored prevention programmes are needed to reduce this loss and lessen the racial gaps.

AB Background: To study whether trauma center patients with positive toxicology findings for cocaine-positive (COC+) are at a higher risk for suicide, homicide, and unintentional injury death after discharge than cocaine-negative (COC+) trauma patients.
   Methods: Patients admitted between July 1983 and June 1995 and discharged alive from a level I trauma center were prospectively followed up for 1.5 years to 14.5 years. The occurrence of suicide, homicide, and unintentional injury death was explored in relation to COC+ status at admission using Cox proportional hazards methodology. Models included possible confounders. Interactions with each of the main effects were explored.
   Results: Of the 27,399 admissions, 21,500 had urine COC toxicology testing performed and were included in the study. COC was positive in 11.4% ofthe studied population, COC+ patients were significantly younger, with 72% of COC+ versus 43% of COC- in the 25 to 44 years age group. COC+ patients were more likely to be men, positive for alcohol, and intentional injury victims. COC+ status was not associated with subsequent suicide. Furthermore, the COC+ status association with subsequent homicide became nonsignificant after adjusting for confounders. Unadjusted COC+ status was associated with unintentional injury death (odds ratio = 1.65 [1.14-2.40]). Interactions were found in the association with unintentional injury death such that COC+ status tripled the odds of injury death (odds ratio = 2.75 [1.58-4.78]) among the alcohol-negative patients within the 25 to 45 years age group.
   Conclusion: COC+ trauma patients are at an increased risk of subsequent unintentional injury death after discharge from a trauma center. Suicide and homicide occurrence seems to be unaffected.

AB Introduction: National estimates of U.S. Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander (NHPI), American Indian/Alaskan Native (AIAN), and multiracial adolescent substance use and suicidality are scarce because of their small population sizes. The aim was to estimate the national prevalence of, and disparities in, substance use and suicidality among these understudied adolescents.
   Methods: Analyses conducted in 2017 of U.S. adolescents (grades ninth to 12th) from the 1991-2015 Combined National Youth Behavioral Risk Surveys estimated (1) prevalence of lifetime and current (past 30-day) substance use, past 12-month depressed mood, and suicidality by racial group; and (2) AORs for depressed mood and suicidality regressed on current alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use.
   Results: Among 184,494 U.S. adolescents, alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana were commonly used with lifetime prevalence of 75.32%, 58.11%, and 40.55%, respectively, and current prevalence of 44.51%, 24.58%, and 22.01%, respectively. Past 12-month prevalence of suicidal thoughts, suicide planning, and attempted suicide were 18.87%, 14.75%, and 7.98%, respectively. Relative to non-Hispanic whites, NHPI, AIAN, and multiracial adolescents had higher prevalence of using many illicit substances (e.g., marijuana, heroin), depressed mood, and suicidal thoughts, planning, and attempts (p < 0.05). Except for NHPIs and current alcohol use, current alcohol and cigarette use were independently associated with 2.0-2.3 times greater AORs (p < 0.05) for attempted suicide among the target adolescents.
   Conclusions: U.S. NHPI, AIAN, and multiracial adolescents are disproportionately burdened by illicit substance use, depressed mood, and suicidality. Current alcohol and cigarette use may predispose these adolescents toward suicidality, offering potential pathways to alleviate suicide risk. (C) 2018 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

AB IMPORTANCE Accessible and cost-effective interventions for suicidality are needed to address high rates of suicidal behavior among military service members. Caring Contacts are brief periodic messages that express unconditional care and concern and have been previously shown to prevent suicide deaths, attempts, ideation, and hospitalizations.
   OBJECTIVE To test the effectiveness of augmenting standard military health care with Caring Contacts delivered via text message to reduce suicidal thoughts and behaviors over 12 months.
   DESIGN. SETTING. AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized clinical trial was conducted at 3 military installations in the southern and western United States. Soldiers and Marines identified as being at risk of suicide were recruited between April 2013 and September 2016. The final follow-up was in September 2017.
   INTERVENTIONS Both groups received standard care, and the Caring Contacts group also received consisted of 11 text messages delivered on day 1, at week 1, at months 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, and on participants' birthdays.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes were current suicidal ideation and suicide risk incidents (hospitalization or medical evacuation). Secondary outcomes were worst-point suicidal ideation, emergency department visits, and suicide attempts. Suicidal ideation was measured by the Scale for Suicide Ideation, suicide risk incidents, and emergency department visits by the Treatment History Interview; attempted suicide was measured by the Suicide Attempt Self-Injury Count.
   RESULTS Among 658 randomized participants (329 randomizely assigned to each group), data were analyzed for 657 individuals (mean [SD] age, 25.2 [6]] years; 539 men [82.0%]). All participants reported suicidal ideation at baseline, and 291(44.3%) had previously attempted suicide. Of the 657 participants, 461(70.2%) were assessed at 12 months. Primary outcomes were nonsignificant. There was no significant effect on likelihood or severity of current suicidal ideation or likelihood of a suicide risk incident; there was also no effect on emergency department visits. However, participants who received Caring Contacts (172 of 216 participants [79.6%]) had lower odds than those receiving standard care alone (179 of 204 participants [87.7%]) of experiencing any suicidal ideation between baseline and follow-up (odds ratio, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.33-0.95]; P =.03) and fewer had attempted suicide since baseline (21 of 233 [9.0%] in the group receiving Caring Contacts vs 34 of 228 [14.9%] in the standard-care group; odds ratio, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.29-0.92]; P =.03).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This trial provides inconsistent results on the effectiveness of caring text messages between primary and secondary outcomes, but this inexpensive and scalable intervention offers promise for preventing suicide attempts and ideation in military personnel. Additional research is needed.

AB Our objective was to determine the association between panic attacks (PAs) and panic disorder (PD), and suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SAs) in a nationally representative sample of adults in the community. Data were drawn from the National Comorbidity Survey (n = 5,877), a representative household sample of adults ages 15-54 in the United States. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between current and lifetime PA and PD and SI and SA, adjusting for differences in demographic characteristics, comorbid mental disorders (major depression, alcohol dependence, and substance dependence), childhood trauma (physical and sexual abuse), and number of lifetime mental disorders. Past-year and lifetime PA and PD were associated with increased SI (both past year and lifetime), and persisted after adjusting for comorbidity and early trauma. Associations between PA and SA were no longer statistically significant after adjusting for comorbidity. Past-year and lifetime PD were associated with lifetime SA, but these associations were no longer statistically significant after adjusting for comorbidity. Past-year and lifetime PD were associated with past-year SA, and this association persisted after adjusting for demographics, comorbidity, and number of lifetime mental disorders. These findings are consistent with previous results, and further help to clarify the relationships between panic and suicide behavior by identifying potential methodological reasons for inconsistencies in results from previous studies.

AB Mental health problems are endemic across the globe, and suicide, a strong corollary of poor mental health, is a leading cause of death. Classic psychedelic use may occasion lasting improvements in mental health, but the effects of classic psychedelic use on suicidality are unknown. We evaluated the relationships of classic psychedelic use with psychological distress and suicidality among over 190,000 USA adult respondents pooled from the last five available years of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2008-2012) while controlling for a range of covariates. Lifetime classic psychedelic use was associated with a significantly reduced odds of past month psychological distress (weighted odds ratio (OR)=0.81 (0.72-0.91)), past year suicidal thinking (weighted OR=0.86 (0.78-0.94)), past year suicidal planning (weighted OR=0.71 (0.54-0.94)), and past year suicide attempt (weighted OR=0.64 (0.46-0.89)), whereas lifetime illicit use of other drugs was largely associated with an increased likelihood of these outcomes. These findings indicate that classic psychedelics may hold promise in the prevention of suicide, supporting the view that classic psychedelics' most highly restricted legal status should be reconsidered to facilitate scientific study, and suggesting that more extensive clinical research with classic psychedelics is warranted.

AB Physicians are not immune to psychosocial problems but may face unique impediments to attending to them, Self-care among physicians is not a topic generally included as a part of professional training, nor is it a topic that readily receives consideration in professional practice. The stresses of professional practice can exact a great toll, however, and self-neglect can ead to tragic consequences. In some areas, particularly suicide rates, physicians have increased vulnerability, and in other areas problems may be unrecognized (depression, substance abuse, marital problems, and-other stress-related concerns). Female physicians show some particular areas of risk. In this paper, we raise questions about how and why physicians may be particularly vulnerable, review the available literature about the extent and nature of such problems in physicians, discuss possible factors related to the development of these problems in physicians, and suggest a variety of solutions to improve physician self-care.

AB In 1910, the first college mental health service sought to help college students with personality development and building a healthy mind. In 1920, the meeting that founded the American College Health Association (ACHA) identified "mental hygiene" as important, although a separate Mental Health Section was not established in ACHA until 1957. Between 1920 and 1960, a series of national meetings helped define the role and functioning of college mental health and counseling services. Most colleges employed a multidisciplinary staff of psychologists, psychiatric social workers, and psychiatrists to provide clinical services for Students and consultation and education for faculty and staff. Mental health services on college campuses grew rapidly in the 1960s and 1970s, leading to discussions in the late 20th century of the use of brief psychotherapies, prevention and treatment of drug and alcohol abuse, prevention of suicide and homicide, the use of psychotropic medications, and effective campus interventions.

AB The goal was to assess rates of anxiety and depression in adolescents in two areas of Zhejiang Province, China. A cross-sectional survey was carried-out using a self-report questionnaire developed for this study. Participants were middle school students (age range 13-16 years) in an urban and a rural setting. There were 1576 completed questionnaires. Symptoms of anxiety sufficient to interfere with enjoyment of life, relaxation, and sleep were common (48%, 40%, and 27%, respectively). School-related problems were the predominant sources of worry. One third reported a history of depression, 16% had at times felt life was not worth living, and 9% reported that they had attempted suicide. Girls were more likely to report symptoms of depression. Patterns of help-seeking showed reliance on friends and parents; only 1% had sought professional help. There were no significant differences in anxiety and depression between one-child and multisibling families.

AB The clinical importance of relationship discord was examined through evaluating the association between relationship discord and multiple measures of impairment and psychological distress in a population-based sample of married and cohabiting adults (N = 2,677). In comparison to people that were not in discordant relationships, individuals in discordant relationships reported greater social role impairment with relatives and friends and greater work role impairment. They also reported higher levels of general distress and poorer perceived health and were more likely to report suicide ideation. With the exception of suicide ideation, the associations between relationship discord and impairment and psychological distress remained significant when controlling for current mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders, suggesting that relationship discord is incrementally related to impairment and psychological distress over and above the effects of psychiatric disorders.

AB This article reports results of an ongoing study of femicide in New York City. Using medical examiner records, femicides occurring between 1990 and 1999 were categorized according to whether an intimate partner perpetrated the homicide. Descriptive analyses results revealed that most femicide victims were young, Black, and killed in poor neighborhoods. Among cases with a known perpetrator, 40% were intimate partner femicides. Whereas the rate of nonintimate partner femicide decreased between 1990 and 1999, the rate of intimate partner femicide remained relatively stable. Multivariate analyses revealed that the strongest predictors of femicide by an intimate partner included having children under 18, living in a private residence, and being foreign born. Homicide followed by the suicide of the offender was also strongly associated with intimate partner femicide. Intimate Partner femicide exhibits a unique epidemiology, and this knowledge should be used to plan and guide prevention activities.

ID MENTAL-DISORDERS; UNITED-STATES; MORTALITY; DEPRESSION; PREVALENCE;

AB With costs of approximately 5.8 billion EUR annually, bipolar disorders represent a substantial burden on German society. The costs are mainly due to high indirect costs caused by morbidity-related unemployment, suicide-related losses of productivity, time off from work, and early retirement. Inpatient care, with a considerable average length of stay for patients with bipolar disorders, accounts for two-thirds of direct costs. This paper refers to statistics on use of healthcare services based primarily on the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision. Representing a relatively narrow definition of bipolar disorders in comparison with the clinically relevant spectrum, this classification leads to a conservative estimate of the total costs. The significant lag between first acute episode and a correct diagnosis causes a delayed onset of maintenance treatment that leads to increased costs. Increasing public awareness, destigmatizing the disease, and educating physicians are necessary steps to limit the substantial economic burden for society.

AB A 74-year-old widowed white man with chronic rheumatoid arthritis presented with nausea and weight loss. He was diagnosed with failure to thrive and admitted for hydration. Misoprostol was determined to be the etiology of his symptoms and he was discharged home. Three days later, he killed himself with a gunshot to the head. Clinicians often fail to recognize those at high risk for suicide. Suicidal risk is increased in both psychiatric and physical illness, and particularly when both are present. Psychiatric illness, particularly depression, often underlies chronic medical illness. The purpose of this case report is to remind health care providers of the strong association between depression and chronic medical illness, and to consider this in all patients, including those who present solely with physical symptoms. Recognizing this association and screening for it, as recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, may prevent the unnecessary tragedy of suicide.

AB Background: Body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) has been linked to depression and the risk of suicide attempts and deaths in conflicting directions.
   Methods: In a prospective cohort study of 46 755 men free of cancer enrolled in the Health Professionals Followup Study, participants reported their height, weight, diet, and physical activity on repeated occasions beginning in 1986 and were followed up until death or until February 2002. A subsample of 1829 men reported their mental health-related quality of life with the Mental Component Summary Scale of the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey in 1998.
   Results: A total of 131 men died from suicide during follow-up. A higher BMI was related to a graded decline in the suicide mortality rate, from 52 per 100 000 personyears among men with a BMI of less than 21 to 13 per 100 000 among men with a BMI of 30 or higher; the adjusted hazard ratio per 1-U BMI increment was 0.89 (95% confidence interval, 0.84-0.95; P <. 001). The relationship was consistent when baseline or updated measures of BMI were used and with adjustment for medical illness, dietary factors, antidepressant use, physical activity, or social support. Height and physical activity were not strongly associated with risk. Analyses of mental health-related quality of life showed a similar positive relationship with BMI.
   Conclusions: Among men, risk of death from suicide is strongly inversely related to BMI, but not to height or to physical activity. Although obesity cannot be recommended on the basis of its detrimental effects, further research into the mechanisms of lower risk among overweight and obese men may provide insights into effective methods of suicide prevention.

AB Although over 100 years of research has been dedicated to understanding the connection between religiosity and suicide, many questions still remain. This is especially true among adolescent populations in countries outside the US. In 2008, over 700 students attending eight alternative high school centers in central Mexico completed a health survey designed to provide a comprehensive overview of their physical, mental, spiritual, and emotional health. This article reports on the findings of a secondary analysis study of those data and focuses on the protective influence of religiosity on suicidal ideation. The findings of this study are discussed in light of the network theory's assertion that there is a belonging aspect to religion, and also to the idea that in religiously homogeneous communities of Mexico, religion can have a protective effect on the suicidal ideation of its members.

   STAFF TURNOVER; PUBLIC-HEALTH; ATTITUDES
AB Background: Reducing youth suicide in the United States (U.S.) is a national public health priority, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning (LGBTQ) youth are at elevated risk. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) endorses six evidence-based (EB) strategies that center on meeting the needs of LGBTQ youth in schools; however, fewer than 6 % of U.S. schools implement all of them. The proposed intervention model, "RLAS" (Implementing School Nursing Strategies to Reduce LGBTQ Adolescent Suicide), builds on the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment (EPIS) conceptual framework and the Dynamic Adaptation Process (DAP) to implement EB strategies in U.S. high schools. The DAP accounts for the multilevel context of school settings and uses Implementation Resource Teams (IRTs) to facilitate appropriate expertise, advise on acceptable adaptations, and provide data feedback to make schools implementation ready and prepared to sustain changes.
   Methods/Design: Mixed methods will be used to examine individual, school, and community factors influencing both implementation process and youth outcomes. A cluster randomized controlled trial will assess whether LGBTQ students and their peers in RLAS intervention schools (n = 20) report reductions in suicidality, depression, substance use, bullying, and truancy related to safety concerns compared to those in usual care schools (n = 20). Implementation progress and fidelity for each EB strategy in RLAS intervention schools will be examined using a modified version of the Stages of Implementation Completion checklist. During the implementation and sustainment phases, annual focus groups will be conducted with the 20 IRTs to document their experiences identifying and advancing adaptation supports to facilitate use of EB strategies and their perceptions of the DAP.
   Discussion: The DAP represents a data-informed, collaborative, multiple stakeholder approach to progress from exploration to sustainment and obtain fidelity during the implementation of EB strategies in school settings. This study is designed to address the real-world implications of enabling the use of EB strategies by school nurses with the goal of decreasing suicide and youth risk behaviors among LGBTQ youth. Through its participatory processes to refine and sustain EB strategies in high schools, the RLAS represents a novel contribution to implementation science.

AB Research suggests that transgender people face high levels of discrimination in society, which may contribute to their disproportionate risk for poor health. However, little is known about whether gender nonconformity, as a visible marker of one's stigmatized status as a transgender individual, heightens trans people's experiences with discrimination and, in turn, their health. Using data from the largest survey of transgender adults in the United States, the National Transgender Discrimination Survey (N=4,115), we examine the associations among gender nonconformity, transphobic discrimination, and health-harming behaviors (i.e., attempted suicide, drug/alcohol abuse, and smoking). The results suggest that gender nonconforming trans people face more discrimination and, in turn, are more likely to engage in health-harming behaviors than trans people who are gender conforming. Our findings highlight the important role of gender nonconformity in the social experiences and well-being of transgender people.

DE Solitary confinement; Immigration detention; United States; Immigration
ID SELF-HARM; SUICIDE; HISTORY
AB In September 2013, the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) issued a directive regarding the use of solitary confinement for ICE detainees. Among other provisions, the directive mandated reporting on the rationale behind decisions to place a detainee into solitary confinement, with particular emphases on placements lasting more than 14 days and for reasons related to illness and other "special vulnerabilities." This paper analyzes administrative data from ICE, gathered via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, on the use of solitary confinement per the 2013 ICE directive. The FOIA request covers 1193 incidents of solitary confinement from the beginning of the directive (September 2013) through the date of the FOIA request (September 2016), across six facilities under the jurisdiction of two California Field Offices (Los Angeles and San Francisco). Results reveal significant differences in the use of solitary confinement by gender, mental illness status, whether the confined individual had an attorney, Field Office jurisdiction, and individual facility. In addition, we document the extensive use of solitary confinement for "protective custody" and show that this category is potentially punitive in nature. Given the limited nature of access to information on ICE detainees, this is one of the only analyses of solitary confinement in immigrant detention facilities in the United States.

By interrogating the geographic variations in the findings, such as high rates of poor mental health outcomes in the United Kingdom, large gay-heterosexual disparities in the Netherlands, and lower and improving rates of both outcomes and risk factors in Vermont and British Columbia, this study asserts that policy regimes, health programming, and the ways in which sexual minorities are constructed in places all contribute to their mental health.

TI Epidemiologic Trends in Loperamide Abuse and Misuse
SO ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID AMERICAN ASSOCIATION; UNITED-STATES; DIARRHEA; TRIAL
AB Study objective: Loperamide abuse has been increasing in the United States as a potential alternative to manage opioid withdrawal symptoms or to achieve euphoric effects of opioid use. In June 2016, the Food and Drug Administration warned health care providers and the general public about potential serious adverse outcomes, including cardiac dysrhythmias and death. The purpose of this study is to determine recent trends in intentional loperamide abuse and misuse, reported clinical effects and management, and medical outcomes as reported to poison centers across the United States.
   Methods: Loperamide exposures reported to the National Poison Data System indicating intentional misuse, abuse, and suspected suicide between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2015, were assessed. Demographic and temporal trends, as well as reported clinical effects, medical management, and health outcomes, were analyzed.
   Results: There was a 91% increase in reported exposures from 2010 to 2015, of which half were single-agent loperamide use only. Loperamide exposures reported to the National Poison Data System increased at approximately 38 cases per year (95% confidence interval [CI] 32.5 to 42.9; P<0.0001). Fifteen deaths were reported during this time frame, of which 8 involved single-agent loperamide abuse.
   Conclusion: Loperamide abuse and misuse are projected to increase in the absence of any methods to reduce exposure or curb abuse. Health care providers should consider the potential for loperamide toxicity when managing patients with opioidlike toxicity.

AB Although previous research suggests that increased religiosity is associated with better mental health and many authors have conjectured that religion-based social support may help explain this connection, scant research has directly examined whether religion-based support mediates religiosity and mental health. The present study examined whether various dimensions of religion-based support (social interaction, instrumental, and emotional) mediated the relationship between religiosity and mental health in college students in the Midwest United States. As expected, of the support dimensions, perceived emotional support was the strongest predictor of decreased hopelessness, depression, and suicide behaviors; and the relationships among intrinsic religiosity and the mental health variables were fully mediated by emotional support. These findings provide strong support to the notion that the relationship between religiosity and mental health can be reduced to mediators such as social support. Research and theoretical implications are discussed.

AB Appalachia-a region that stretches from Mississippi to New York-has historically been recognized as a socially and economically disadvantaged part of the United States, and growing evidence suggests that health disparities between it and the rest of the country are widening. We compared infant mortality and life expectancy disparities in Appalachia to those outside the region during the period 1990-2013. We found that infant mortality disparities widened for both whites and blacks, with infant mortality 16 percent higher in Appalachia in 2009-13, and the region's deficit in life expectancy increased from 0.6 years in 1990-92 to 2.4 years in 2009-13. The association between area poverty and life expectancy was stronger in Appalachia than in the rest of the United States. We found wide health disparities, including a thirteen-year gap in life expectancy among black men in high-poverty areas of Appalachia, compared to white women in low-poverty areas elsewhere. Higher mortality in Appalachia from cardiovascular diseases, lung cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, nephritis or kidney diseases, suicide, unintentional injuries, and drug overdose contributed to lower life expectancy in the region, compared to the rest of the country. Widening health disparities were also due to slower mortality improvements in Appalachia.

AB Although approximately one-third of all children born in the United States are expected to spend some time living in a married or cohabiting stepfamily, our understanding of the implications of stepfamilies for the well-being of youth remains incomplete. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this research investigates adolescent depressive symptomatology and suicide ideation in stepfather families, paying careful attention to variation in pathways of stepfamily formation. I test multiple theoretical explanations for the effects of family structure on adolescent emotional well-being, including perspectives emphasizing economic deprivation, socialization and social control, stress and instability, and community connections. I also explore the possibility that observed associations between family structure and youth well-being might be spuriously produced by the preexisting selective characteristics of stepfamilies. The results of this research point to a complex relationship between stepfamily formation and adolescent emotional well-being, suggesting both positive and negative effects.

DT Editorial Material
AB Severe acetaminophen hepatotoxicity frequently leads to acute liver failure (ALF). We determined the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of acetaminophen-induced ALF at 22 tertiary care centers in the United States. Detailed prospective data were gathered on 662 consecutive patients over a 6-year period fulfilling standard criteria for ALF (coagulopathy and encephalopathy), from which 275 (42%) were determined to result from acetaminophen liver injury. The annual percentage of acetaminophen-related ALF rose during the study from 28% in 1998 to 51% in 2003. Median dose ingested was 24 g (equivalent to 48 extra-strength tablets). Unintentional overdoses accounted for 131 (48%) cases, intentional (suicide attempts) 122 (44%), and 22 (8%) were of unknown intent. In the unintentional group, 38% took two or more acetaminophen preparations simultaneously, and 63% used narcotic-containing compounds. Eighty-one percent of unintentional patients reported taking acetaminophen and/or other analgesics for acute or chronic pain syndromes. Overall, 178 subjects (65%) survived, 74 (27%) died without transplantation, and 23 subjects (8%) underwent liver transplantation; 71% were alive at 3 weeks. Transplant-free survival rate and rate of liver transplantation were similar between intentional and unintentional groups. In conclusion, acetaminophen hepatotoxicity far exceeds other causes of acute liver failure in the United States. Susceptible patients have concomitant depression, chronic pain, alcohol or narcotic use, and/or take several preparations simultaneously. Education of patients, physicians, and pharmacies to limit high-risk use settings is recommended.

AB IMPORTANCE Gun violence and injuries pose a substantial threat to children and youth in the United States. Existing evidence points to the need for interventions and policies for keeping guns out of the hands of children and youth.
   OBJECTIVES (1) To examine the association between state gun law environment and youth gun carrying in the United States, and (2) to determine whether adult gun ownership mediates this association.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was a repeated cross-sectional observational study design with 3 years of data on youth gun carrying from US states. The Youth Risk Behavior Survey comprises data of representative samples of students in grades 9 to 12 from biennial years of 2007, 2009, and 2011. We hypothesized that states with more restrictive gun laws have lower rates of youth gun carrying, and this association is mediated by adult gun ownership.
   EXPOSURES State gun law environment as measured by state gun law score.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Youth gun carrying was defined as having carried a gun on at least 1 day during the 30 days before the survey.
   RESULTS In the fully adjusted model, a 10-point increase in the state gun law score, which represented a more restrictive gun law environment, was associated with a 9% decrease in the odds of youth gun carrying (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.91 [95% CI, 0.86-0.96]). Adult gun ownership mediated the association between state gun law score and youth gun carrying (AOR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.86-1.01], with 29% attenuation of the regression coefficient from -0.09 to -0.07 based on bootstrap resampling).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE More restrictive overall gun control policies are associated with a reduced likelihood of youth gun carrying. These findings are relevant to gun policy debates about the critical importance of strengthening overall gun law environment to prevent youth gun carrying.

AB Objective: Bipolar disorder (BD) is one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions and is associated with high suicide risk. To explore the reasons for this link, this study examined the interaction between traumatic stress and BD polygenic risk score in relation to suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) in adolescent and young adult offspring and relatives of persons with BD (BD-relatives) compared with adolescent and young adult offspring of individuals without psychiatric disorders (controls).
   Method: Data were collected from 4 sites in the United States and 1 site in Australia from 2006 through 2012. Generalized estimating equation models were used to compare rates of ideation, attempts, and NSSI between BD-relatives (n = 307) and controls (n = 166) and to determine the contribution of demographic factors, traumatic stress exposure, lifetime mood or substance (alcohol/drug) use disorders, and BD polygenic risk score.
   Results: After adjusting for demographic characteristics and mood and substance use disorders, BD-relatives were at increased risk for suicidal ideation and attempts but not for NSSI. Independent of BD -relative versus control status, demographic factors, or mood and substance use disorders, exposure to trauma within the past year (including bullying, sexual abuse, and domestic violence) was associated with suicide attempts (p =.014), and BD polygenic risk score was marginally associated with attempts (p =.061). Importantly, the interaction between BD polygenic risk score and traumatic event exposures was significantly associated with attempts, independent of demographics, relative versus control status, and mood and substance use disorders (p =.041).
   Conclusion: BD -relatives are at increased risk for suicide attempts and ideation, especially if they are exposed to trauma and have evidence of increased genetic vulnerability.

AB Objective: The age at onset of bipolar disorder varies greatly in different countries and continents. The association between load of family history of psychiatric illness and age at onset has not been adequately explored.
   Methods: 979 outpatients with bipolar disorder (from 4 sites in the United States and 3 in the Netherlands and Germany) gave informed consent and completed a questionnaire about their demographics, age at onset of illness, and family history of unipolar and bipolar disorder, alcohol and substance abuse comorbidity, suicide attempts, and "other" illnesses in their parents, 4 grandparents, and any offspring. We examined how the parental and grandparental burden of these illnesses related to the age at onset of the patients' bipolar disorder.
   Results: The burden of family psychiatric history was strongly related to an earlier age at onset of illness in both US and European patients (F-3,F-906 = 35.42, P<.0001). However, compared to the Europeans, patients in the United States had both more family history of most difficulties and notably earlier age at onset. Earlier age at onset was associated with a greater illness burden in the patient's offspring (t(568) = 4.1, P<.0001).
   Conclusions: More parental and grandparental psychiatric illness was associated with an earlier age at onset of bipolar disorder, which is earlier in the United States compared with Europe and is strongly related to a poor long-term prognosis. This apparent polygenic contribution to early onset deserves further study and therapeutic attempts at ameliorating the transgenerational impact.

AB Objectives: This Study assessed college counselors' anticipatory guidance on firearms for student clients. Participants: The membership of the Association for University and College Counseling Center Directors was used to identify a national random sample of counseling centers (n = 36 1). One Counselor from each center was selected to survey. Methods: I n the winter of 2008, a 3-wave mailing procedure was used to maximize the response rate. Completed surveys served as consent (as approved by the University Human Subjects Committee). Results: A total of 213 counselors (59%) responded. They were unlikely to provide anticipatory guidance (6%), chart/keep records on client ownership/access to firearms (17%), or to counsel the majority of clients from various diagnostic categories on firearms. Conclusions: University personnel are likely to refer students with suspected mental health problems to university counseling centers. The findings indicate that few counseling centers will address firearm issues with Students.

AB Relationship violence is a common problem faced by adolescents in the United States. In general, adolescents are at higher risk for relationship victimization than adults (Silverman, Raj, Mucci, & Hathaway, 2001), and females between the ages of 16 and 24 years are at the highest risk of relationship victimization (Rennison, 2001). This study uses data from the 2007 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance (YRBSS) System (or referred to as Youth Risk Behavior Survey [YRBS]; N = 11,781) of adolescents between the ages of 14 and 17 years to estimate two logistic regression models on the association between relationship violence and suicidal behaviors controlling for variables such as sexual assault and drug use. The findings indicated that victimized adolescents are at higher risk for planning and/or attempting suicide compared to nonvictimized adolescents. Implications for research and practice are explored.

AB Recent data indicate increasing suicide rates for children and adolescents in the United States, Great Britain and the Netherlands. These facts call for a critical discussion of prescription rates of antidepressants for pediatric use. Obviously the U.S. and European regulators issued public warnings about a possible association between antidepressants and suicidal thinking and behaviour have discouraged physicians to use antidepressants in this age group. Untreated depression means impairment of psychosocial development of children and their families. Alarmingly there is no evidence of a significant increase in the use of treatment alternatives as for example psychotherapy. High relapse rate with early onset of depressions are common and therefore children with depression need all our attention and best treatment available.
   Current Austrian suicidal statistics do not yet demonstrate increasing suicidal rates in adolescents as seen in the U.S., the U.K. and the Netherlands. Thus all our alertness is needed to avoid any analogical progress in suicide rates and despite regulatory warnings and certainly after a careful risk-benefit analyses physicians have to consider pharmacological treatment options in depressive children and adolescents.

AB BACKGROUND Legal firearm sales occur largely through suppliers that have Federal Firearm Licensees (FFLs). Since FFL density might reflect ease-of-access to firearm purchases, we hypothesized that the number of FFL dealers would be associated with firearm-related deaths. We further hypothesized that licensee-type subsets would be associated with differential risks for gun-related deaths. METHODS We used data from the National Center for Health Statistics National Vital Statistics System (2008-2014) and national data on Federal Firearms Licensees for 2014. Correlation analysis and linear regression analysis were performed to determine the relationship between different licensee types and firearm-related deaths. We controlled for population, number of statewide registered firearms, and the density of other types of FFLs. RESULTS We identified a total of 65,297 FFLs. There was a moderate correlation (R = 0.53, rho = 0.48) between total FFL density and firearm-related death rates. Further analysis by type of firearm-related death showed a strong correlation (R = 0.81, rho = 0.76) between total FFL density and firearm-related suicide rates. No correlation was found between total FFL density and firearm-related homicide rate. Among individual FFL types, FFL02 (firearm dealing pawnshop) density was the only FFL-type found to be correlated with firearm-related death rates. We found a strong correlation between FFL02 density and overall firearm-related death rate (R = 0.69, rho = 0.78) and firearm-related suicide rate (R = 0.72, rho = 0.78). Linear regression analysis showed that even while controlling for number of registered firearms and population, the number of firearm-dealing pawnshops remained significantly associated with overall firearm-related deaths and firearm-related suicides. CONCLUSION Access to legally distributed firearms is associated with firearm-related death rates, particularly firearm-related suicides. Specifically, firearm-dealing pawnshops were associated with suicide-related deaths. These findings suggest that deeper exploration of legal firearm access and firearm-related injuries would benefit discussion of preventative measures.

AB Objective. To compare demographics and motivations for falls from bridges at the United States-Mexico border and in El Paso County, Texas, and to analyze injuries and injury patterns to support intentionality and to provide treatment recommendations.
   Methods. A retrospective observational review was conducted of hospital admissions to a trauma center after falls from bridges from 1995 to 2009. Statistical methods used were chi-square testing, T-test for means comparison, univariate correlations, and regression analysis.
   Results. Of the 97 evaluated patients, 81.4% fell from U.S.-Mexico border bridges, including one patient who fell from a railway bridge; 74.7% of those falling from border bridges had a non-U.S. address, contrasting with 22.2% of those who fell within the United States. Falls over the border were associated with more immigration-related motivations and fewer suicide attempts. Injuries included lower extremities in 76 (78.4%) and thoracolumbar spine in 27 (27.8%) patients; 16 patients with a thoracolumbar spine fracture (59.3%) also had a lower extremity injury. Mean hospital length of stay was 7.2 days. Mean injury severity score was 8.45 (range 1-43). Age, injury severity score, and pelvic fracture increased the hospital length of stay.
   Conclusions. Patients fell while emigrating-immigrating based on residence and motivating factors. A dyad of lower extremity and thoracolumbar spine injuries coincided in 59.3% of those with a thoracolumbar spine injury; thoracolumbar spine imaging of patients evaluated after falls from bridges is recommended. Proposed prevention strategies include posting signs on bridges and installing catch-net safety barriers.

AB Background Receiving a cancer diagnosis is a stressful event that may increase risks of suicide and cardiovascular death, especially soon after diagnosis.
   Methods We conducted a cohort study of 342 497 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer from January 1, 1979, through December 31, 2004, in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
   Results Program. Follow-up started from the date of prostate cancer diagnosis to the end of first 12 calendar months after diagnosis. The relative risks of suicide and cardiovascular death were calculated as standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) comparing corresponding incidences among prostate cancer patients with those of the general US male population, with adjustment for age, calendar period, and state of residence. We compared risks in the first year and months after a prostate cancer diagnosis. The analyses were further stratified by calendar period at diagnosis, tumor characteristics, and other variables. Results During follow-up, 148 men died of suicide (mortality rate = 0.5 per 1000 person-years) and 6845 died of cardiovascular diseases (mortality rate = 21.8 per 1000 person-years). Patients with prostate cancer were at increased risk of suicide during the first year (SMR = 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2 to 1.6), especially during the first 3 months (SMR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.4 to 2.6), after diagnosis. The elevated risk was apparent in pre-prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (1979-1986) and peri-PSA (1987-1992) eras but not since PSA testing has been widespread (1993-2004). The risk of cardiovascular death was slightly elevated during the first year (SMR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.06 to 1.12), with the highest risk in the first month (SMR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.89 to 2.22), after diagnosis. The first-month risk was statistically significantly elevated during the entire study period, and the risk was higher for patients with metastatic tumors (SMR = 3.22, 95% CI = 2.68 to 3.84) than for those with local or regional tumors (SMR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.42 to 1.74).
   Conclusion A diagnosis of prostate cancer may increase the immediate risks of suicide and cardiovascular death.

AB Objectives: Little research has focused on the relation of immigration and suicidal behaviour in youth. Nevertheless, the impact of migration on the mental health of youth is an issue of increasing societal importance. This review aimed to present studies on the prevalence of suicidal behaviour in immigrant youth in various countries and to provide possible explanations for suicidal behaviour in immigrant youth, especially regarding acculturation.
   Methods: The review included a literature search to locate articles on the subject of suicidal behaviour in immigrant youth in the context of acculturation.
   Results: Studies on suicidal behaviour in culturally diverse youth are few and most of the existing research does not differentiate ethnic minorities from immigrants. Studies on epidemiology and on specific risk factors were found regarding various immigrant youth including Hispanics in the United States, Asians in North America and Europe, as well as comparative studies between different immigrant groups in specific countries.
   Conclusions: The relation between immigration status and suicidal behaviours in youth appears to vary by ethnicity and country of settlement. Time spent in the new country as well as intergenerational communication and conflicts with parents have, in many of the studies, been related to suicidality in immigrant youth. Summing up, there is a clear and urgent need to further pursue the work in this field, to develop targeted public health interventions as well as psychosocial treatment for preventing suicide in these youth.

AB Background: Violence-related injuries, including suicide, adversely affect the health and welfare of all Americans through premature death, disability, medical costs, and lost productivity. Estimating the magnitude of the economic burden of violence is critical for understanding the potential amount of resources that can be saved if cost-effective violence prevention efforts can be broadly applied. From 2003 to 2005, the lifetime medical costs and productivity losses associated with medically treated injuries due to interpersonal and self-directed violence occurring in the United States in 2000 were assessed.
   Methods: Several nationally representative data sets were combined to estimate the incidence of fatal and nonfatal injuries due to violence. Unit medical and productivity costs were computed and then multiplied by corresponding incidence estimates to yield total lifetime costs of violence-related injuries occurring in 2000.
   Results: The total costs associated with nonfatal injuries and deaths due to violence in 2000 were more than $70 billion. Most of this cost ($64.4 billion or 92%) was due to lost productivity. However, an estimated $5.6 billion was spent on medical care for the more than 2.5 million injuries due to interpersonal and self-directed violence.
   Conclusions: The burden estimates reported here provide evidence of the large health and economic burden of violence-related injuries in the U.S. But the true burden is likely far greater and the need for more research on violence surveillance and prevention are discussed.

AB In contribution to behavior finance studies opposing the efficient market hypothesis, this report tests the null hypothesis that sudden deaths of celebrities are economically-neutral events which do not have a significant impact on United States stock markets. The underlining logic being that although economically-neutral events reflect no financial information, it can alter the decision making process of financial professionals by affecting investor mood, confidence, risk aversion levels and emotional states. This in turn, influences the financial markets. Examining index returns with sudden deaths of celebrities nominated on the Hollywood Walk of Fame as a dummy variable, this paper finds no significant evidence against the null hypothesis. Hence, from this perspective, the US financial market is efficient.

They diagnose and provide the initial management of many medical conditions unrelated to reproductive health. Most importantly they can impact the overall health of patients through incorporating preventive approaches in the annual well-woman visit. This article defines preventive care and identifies leading causes of mortality in women. A framework for identifying key elements of the well-woman examination is summarized. Examples of prevention are provided, which focus on major health care issues that affect adult women.

AB Objectives: The number of children in the United States utilizing emergency department (ED) services for psychiatric crises is increasing, and psychiatric-related ED visits disproportionately burden hospital resources. Yet, there is limited available information on the epidemiology and outcomes of pediatric mental health emergencies. The present study sought to characterize pediatric mental health-related ED presentations in a large urban center and identify factors predictive of inpatient hospitalization.
   Methods: Datawere analyzed from a sample of 225 children (120 female and 105 male children), aged 5 to 18 years, who presented in mental health crisis to Detroit regional EDs over a 27-month period. A trained mental health professional used the Crisis Assessment Tool to assess all children.
   Results: Thirty-eight percent of children presented with severe depression symptoms, and 52% were judged to be at acute risk of suicide, most of whom were female. Sixteen percent of the sample presented with severe psychotic features, and 34% were assessed as being at risk of harming others. Following assessment, 86% of the samplewas directed to inpatient treatment, and no sex differences were found in treatment disposition. Risk of suicide, poor judgment, symptoms of psychosis, and risk of danger to others were all found to be significant predictors of subsequent inpatient hospitalization.
   Conclusions: Results provide descriptive information regarding child psychiatric emergency presentations in the city of Detroit. The identified factors that help determine triage to inpatient hospitalization suggest areas for possible resource allocation and potential ED-based intervention.

AB Despite that prisons in the United States (and other high-income countries) have witnessed an increase in the proportion of older inmates, and that prison populations exhibit high rates of psychiatric illness, there is limited knowledge on the nature of older inmates' psychological health and use/provision of psychiatric care. The present study addresses these gaps, analyzing a nationally representative sample of 1,907 male and female older inmates (age range = 50-84 years; M = 56) housed in U.S. state and federal prisons. The results highlight: (a) the prevalence of psychological issues among older prisoners; (b) factors associated with certain mental disorders and symptoms of mental health issues; (c) the prevalence of psychiatric treatment before and during imprisonment for those with (and without) reported psychological health issues; (d) similarities and differences between male and female older inmates in relation to psychological health, factors associated with psychological issues, and the use/provision of psychiatric care. Discussion points toward recommendations for managing inmate mental health, as well as direction for further research on older inmate mental health and psychiatric care.

AB Investigating firearm injury trends over the past decade, we examined temporal trends overall and according to race/ethnicity and intent in fatal and nonfatal firearm injuries (FFIs and NFIs) in United States during 2001-2013. Counts of FFIs and estimated counts of NFIs were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System. Poisson regression was used to analyze overall and subgroup temporal trends and to estimate annual change per 100,000 persons (change). Total firearm injuries (n = 1,328,109) increased annually by 0.36 (P-trend < 0.0001). FFIs remained constant (change = 0.02; P-trend = 0.22) while NFIs increased (change = 0.35; P-trend < 0.0001). Homicide FFIs declined (change = -0.05; P-trend < 0.0001) while homicide NFIs increased (change = 0.43; Ptrend < 0.0001). Suicide FFIs increased (change = 0.07; Ptrend < 0.0001) while unintentional FFIs and NFIs declined (changes = -0.01 and -0.09, respectively; P-trend < 0.0001 and 0.005). Among whites, FFIs (change = 0.15; P-trend < 0.0001) and NFIs (change = 0.13; P-trend < 0.0001) increased; among blacks, FFIs declined (change = -0.20; P-trend < 0.0001). Among Hispanics, FFIs declined (change = -0.28; P-trend < 0.0001) while NFIs increased (change = 0.55; P-trend = 0.014). The endemic firearm-related injury rates during the first decade of the 21st century mask a shift from firearm deaths towards a rapid rise in nonfatal injuries.

AB A substantial proportion of injuries worldwide are attributable to alcohol consumption, and US estimates indicate that the drinking patterns of racial/ethnic groups vary considerably. The authors reviewed evidence from 19 publications regarding racial/ethnic differences in overall alcohol-attributable injury as well as percent blood alcohol content positivity for injury deaths in the United States. They found that Native Americans evidence higher rates of alcohol-attributable motor vehicle crash fatality, suicide, and falls compared with other racial/ethnic groups; conversely, Asians evidence lower rates of alcohol-attributable injury than other racial/ethnic groups. The rate of alcohol positivity and intoxication among Hispanics is disproportionately high relative to estimates of alcohol use. Black subgroups also evidence higher rates of alcohol positivity than would be expected given estimates of alcohol use, including for alcohol positivity among drivers of fatally injured black children and homicide. These findings highlight the continued need for public health focus on Native American populations with respect to alcohol consumption and injury. Further, the disparity in alcohol-attributable injury mortality among black and Hispanic groups relative to their reported rates of alcohol consumption is an overlooked area of research. The authors review potential social determinants of racial/ethnic disparities in alcohol-attributable injuries and identify directions for further research on these patterns.

   RATES; MORTALITY; SMOKING; DEATH; POPULATION; COMPONENTS
AB Over the course of the 20th century the sex differential in life expectancy at birth in the industrialized countries has widened considerably in favour of women. Starting in the early 1970s, the beginning of a reversal in the long-term pattern of this differential has been noted in some high-income countries. This study documents a sustained pattern of narrowing of this measure into the later part of the 1990s for six of the populations that comprise the G7 countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, England and Wales (as representative of the United Kingdom) and USA. For Japan, a persistence of widening sex differences in survival is noted. The sex differences in life expectancy are decomposed over roughly three decades (early 1970s to late 1990s) from the point of view of four major cause-of-death categories: circulatory diseases, cancers, accidents/violence/suicide, and,other' (residual) causes. In the six countries where the sex gap has narrowed, this has resulted primarily from reduced sex differences in circulatory disease mortality, and secondarily from reduced differences in male and female death rates due to accidents, violence and suicide combined. In some of the countries sex differentials in cancer mortality have been converging lately, and this has also contributed to a narrowing of the difference in life expectancy. In Japan, males have been less successful in reducing their survival disadvantage in relation to Japanese women with regard to circulatory disease and cancer; and in the case of accidents/violence/suicide, male death rates increased during the 1990s. These trends explain the divergent pattern of the sex difference in life expectation in Japan as compared with the other G7 nations.

AB This study investigated clinical, historical and phenomenological correlates of anxious depression in a sample of 159 depressed elders. Regression analyses indicated that comorbidity of anxiety and depression was associated with a history of a greater number of depressive episodes, more negative stressors and with a higher self-reported average stress level over the past six months. Significant bivariate correlates also included feeling sinful, guilty, or worthless, early depressive onset and attempted suicide. The findings suggest a stress-related younger age of onset sub-type of elderly depression which is clinically distinct from late onset elderly depression.

AB The rates of suicide attempts and death by suicide vary considerably over the lifespan, highlighting the influence of different contextual, risk, and protective factors at different points in development (Daniel & Collision, 2009). Hopelessness and lack of connectedness to others are two factors that have been associated with increased risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the lifespan. The primary purposes of this paper are to describe how hopelessness and lack of connectedness to others may contribute to risk for suicidal behaviors, and to outline empirically supported cognitive-behavioral interventions for these difficulties at three developmental periods during which suicidal behavior is prevalent: (a) adolescence and young adulthood, (b) middle adulthood, and (c) older adulthood. This paper is not intended as an exhaustive review, but rather an overview of selected developmental issues related to hopelessness and lack of connectedness to others as risk factors for suicidal behavior. Special emphasis is given to clinical implications for cognitive-behavioral interventions, which are illustrated through case conceptualizations and examples at each developmental period.

AB An estimated 80 of sexually active young women in the United States use hormonal contraceptives during their reproductive years. Associations between hormonal contraceptive use and mood disturbances remain understudied, despite the hypothesis that estrogen and progesterone play a role in mood problems. In this study, we used data from 6,654 sexually active nonpregnant women across 4 waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (19942008), focusing on women aged 2534 years. Women were asked about hormonal contraceptive use in the context of a current sexual partnership; thus, contraceptive users were compared with other sexually active women who were using either nonhormonal contraception or no contraception. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. At ages 2534 years, hormonal contraceptive users had lower mean levels of concurrent depressive symptoms ( 1.04, 95 confidence interval: 1.73, 0.35) and were less likely to report a past-year suicide attempt (odds ratio 0.37, 95 confidence interval: 0.14, 0.95) than women using low-efficacy contraception or no contraception, in models adjusted for propensity scores for hormonal contraceptive use. Longitudinal analyses indicated that associations between hormonal contraception and depressive symptoms were stable. Hormonal contraception may reduce levels of depressive symptoms among young women. Systematic investigation of exogenous hormones as a potential preventive factor in psychiatric epidemiology is warranted.

Rural primary care physicians (PCPs) have a unique position in counseling, preventing, and treating common issues that are specific to rural populations, such as motor vehicle accidents, unintentional injuries, pesticide poisoning, occupational respiratory illnesses, and mental illness. They are also in a unique position to address prevention and social determinants of health. Rural PCPs can use multiple strategies to improve access to medical care.

AB Hispanic youths are disproportionately represented in gangs in the United States, are more likely to drink alcohol at younger ages, and to live in poverty; all are risks for violence and weapon carrying. No studies to date have assessed violence related behaviors and weapon carrying in Hispanic youth over an extended period. This study utilized the national Youth Risk Behavior Surveys from 2001 to 2015 to assess trends in violence related behaviors and weapon carrying of Hispanic adolescents. Our analyses found both physical fighting and fighting on school property had statistically significant reductions from 2001 to 2015 for Hispanic females and their suicide attempts increased from 2009 to 2015. Hispanic males had statistically significant decreasing trends for: being in a physical fight in the past year, being bullied on school property, being in a physical fight on school property within the past year; threatened or injured with a weapon on school property in the past year; and having attempted suicide in the past year. Hispanic females and males had two groups of items highly predictive of weapon carrying behaviors: alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use and violent risk behaviors. Both female and male students who made mostly A's or B's in school were significantly less likely (about half as likely) to carry weapons. This data could be used to identify Hispanic adolescents at higher risk for weapon carrying and used as a basis for enriching programs to improve academic success of Hispanic adolescents.

AB The paper studies the effects of the rule of law on gun ownership. Stronger rule of law encourages productive efforts and increases the incomes of citizens through better-enforced property rights, increasing the incentives to protect their incomes and to own guns. Stronger rule of law also provides better government protection for citizens' incomes and properties through stronger law enforcement and criminal justice systems, reducing their incentives to own guns. Empirical evidence based on cross-country data shows that stronger rule of law increases gun ownership through the income effect but decreases it through the protection effect.

The central aim of this review is to elucidate what is known about the role played by gender in shaping the behaviours of people in the diverse roles of healthcare provider, carer, and patient. It is concluded that, on the whole, researchers have neglected to acknowledge gender differences in the experience of dying. Also lacking is carefully conducted research which is contextualised so that the dying person is better understood as a member of society rather than an isolated individual.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate buprenorphine exposures among children and adolescents <= 19 years old in the United States.
   METHODS: Data were analyzed from calls to US poison control centers for 2007-2016 from the National Poison Data System.
   RESULTS: From 2007 to 2016, there were 11 275 children and adolescents <= 19 years old exposed to buprenorphine reported to US poison control centers. Most exposures were among children < 6 years old (86.1%), unintentional (89.2%), and to a single substance (97.3%). For single-substance exposures, children < 6 years old had greater odds of hospital admission and of serious medical outcome than adolescents 13 to 19 years old. Adolescents accounted for 11.1% of exposures; 77.1% were intentional (including 12.0% suspected suicide), and 27.7% involved multiple substances. Among adolescents, the odds of hospital admission and a serious medical outcome were higher for multiple-substance exposures than single-substance exposures.
   CONCLUSIONS: Buprenorphine is important for the treatment of opioid use disorder, but pediatric exposure can result in serious adverse outcomes. Manufacturers should use unit-dose packaging for all buprenorphine products to help prevent unintentional exposure among young children. Health providers should inform caregivers of young children about the dangers of buprenorphine exposure and provide instructions on proper medication storage and disposal. Adolescents should receive information regarding the risks of substance abuse and misuse. Suspected suicide accounted for 12% of adolescent exposures, highlighting the need for access to mental health services for this age group.

TI European monitoring of Belgian and French penal and prison policies
SO CRIME LAW AND SOCIAL CHANGE
LA English
DT Article
ID PARADOX
AB Case studies of prison policy in France and Belgium contrast sharply. Following the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights ('ECHR') against France for the lack of healthcare for prisoners, the lack of suicide-prevention measures and generally poor conditions of detention, and the integration of ECHR case-law into French law by the 'Council of State' (France's highest administrative court), France has developed a policy for suicide prevention in custody, partially renovated its prisons and implemented major reform of its medical and psychiatric care of prisoners. The ECHR's judgments were influenced by complaints made by very active French human-rights pressure groups to the ECHR. The French situation is therefore characterised by interactions between the European and national regulatory bodies, in contrast to the situation in Belgium, where the Conseil d',tat has exerted only limited control over Belgian prisons, as it has, to date, not incorpated ECHR case-law into Belgian law [1]. In addition, the absence of effective domestic regulation of prisons in Belgium can be explained by the Belgian government's failure to ratify the United Nations' Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture ('OPCAT') and to establish an independent body to prevent torture. This means that the only effective regulation of Belgian prisons is by the United Nations and the Council of Europe, in particular the ECHR, the Committee of Ministers and the Committee for the Prevention of Torture ('CPT'), which have extended the scope of their supervision to cover suicide prevention, physical and mental healthcare, overcrowding and domestic legal remedies for prisoners. In response, Belgium has only occasionally complied with ECHR case-law, especially in the field of domestic legal remedies available to prisoners.

AB Drug overdose is a major cause of Premature death and morbidity among heroin users. This article examines recent research into heroin overdose to inform interventions that will reduce the rate of overdose death. The demographic characteristics of overdose cases are discussed, including factors associated with overdose: polydrug use, drug purity, drug tolerance, routes of administration, and suicide. Responses by heroin users at overdoses are also examined. Potential interventions to reduce the rate of overdose and overdose-related morbidity are examined in light of the emerging data in this field.

TI Attitudes and practices concerning the end of life -: <i>A comparison

DT Article
ID ASSISTED SUICIDE; EUTHANASIA; REQUESTS; DOCTORS; DEATH
AB Background: This study compares attitudes and practices concerning the end-of-life decisions between physicians in the United States and in the Netherlands, using the same set of questions.
   Methods: A total of 152 physicians from Oregon and 67 from the Netherlands were interviewed using the same questions about (1) their attitudes toward increasing morphine with premature death as a likely consequence, physician-assisted suicide (PAS), and euthanasia; and (2) their involvement in cases of euthanasia, PAS, or the ending of life without an explicit request from the patient. Odds ratios, with 95% confidence intervals, were calculated to investigate relation between attitudes and various characteristics of the respondents.
   Results: American physicians found euthanasia less often acceptable than the Dutch, but there was similarity in attitudes concerning increasing morphine and PAS. American physicians found increasing morphine and PAS more often acceptable in cases where patients were concerned about becoming a burden to their family. There was a discrepancy between the attitudes and practices of Dutch physicians concerning PAS. The proportions of physicians having practiced euthanasia, PAS, or ending of life without an explicit request from the patient differ more between the countries than do their attitudes, with American physicians having been involved in these practices less often than the Dutch.
   Conclusions: In this study of American and Dutch physicians, 2 important differences emerge: different attitudes toward the patient who is concerned over being a burden, and different frequency of euthanasia and PAS in the two countries.

ID DELIBERATE SELF-HARM; ADOLESCENT SUICIDE; FOLLOW-UP; PREVENTION; RISK;

AB BACKGROUND: Suicide is the third leading cause of death among individuals age 10 years to 19 years in the United States. Adolescents with suicidal behaviors are often cared for in emergency departments (EDs)/trauma centers and are at an increased risk for subsequent suicide. Many institutions do not have standard procedures to prevent future self-harm. Lethal means restriction (LMR) counseling is an evidence-based suicide prevention strategy that informs families to restrict access to potentially fatal items and has demonstrated efficacy in preventing suicide. The objectives of this study were to examine suicidal behavior among behavioral health patients in a pediatric ED and to assess the use of LMR by hospital staff.
   METHODS: A sample of 298 pediatric patients was randomly selected from the population of behavioral health patients treated at the ED from January 1 through December 31, 2012 (n = 2,294). Descriptive data include demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, etc,), chief complaint, current and past psychiatric history, primary diagnosis, disposition, alcohol/drug abuse, and documentation of any LMR counseling provided in the ED.
   RESULTS: Of the 298 patients, 52% were female, 47% were white, and 76% were in the custody of their parents. Behavior/out of control was the most common chief complaint (43%). The most common diagnoses were mood disorder (25%) and depression (20%). Thirty-four percent of the patients had suicidal ideation, 22% had a suicide plan, 32% had documented suicidal behavior, and 25% of the patients reported having access to lethal means. However, only 4% of the total patient population received any LMR counseling, and only 15% of those with access to lethal means had received LMR counseling.
   CONCLUSION: Providing a safe environment for adolescents at risk for suicidal behaviors should be a priority for all families/caretakers and should be encouraged by health care providers. The ED is a key point of entry into services for suicidal youth and presents an opportunity to implement effective secondary prevention strategies. The low rate of LMR counseling found in this study suggests a need for improved LMR counseling for all at-risk youth. (Copyright (C) 2014 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins)

AB The full scope of the impact of the Great Recession on individuals' mental health has not been quantified to date. In this study we aimed to determine whether financial, job-related, and housing impacts experienced by individuals during the recession predicted changes in the occurrence of symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety, panic attacks, and problematic alcohol use or other substance use. Longitudinal survey data (n = 2,530 to n = 3,293) from the national Midlife in the United States study that were collected before (2003-2004) and after (2012-2013) the Great Recession were analyzed. The population-level trend was toward improvements in mental health over time. However, for individuals, each recession impact experienced was associated with long-lasting and transdiagnostic declines in mental health. These relationships were stronger for some sociodemographic groups, which suggests the need for additional support for people who suffer marked losses during recessions and for those without a strong safety net.

AB The United States has substantially higher levels of firearm violence than most other developed countries. Firearm violence is a significant and preventable public health crisis. Mental illness is a weak risk factor for violence despite popular misconceptions reflected in the media and policy. That said, mental health professionals play a critical role in assessing their patients for violence risk, counseling about firearm safety, and guiding the creation of rational and evidence-based public policy that can be effective in mitigating violence risk without unnecessarily stigmatizing people with mental illness. This article summarizes existing evidence about the interplay among mental illness, violence, and firearms, with particular attention paid to the role of active symptoms, addiction, victimization, and psychosocial risk factors. The social and legal context of firearm ownership is discussed as a preface to exploring practical, evidence-driven, and behaviorally informed policy recommendations for mitigating firearm violence risk.

AB Objective: The present study examined ADHD symptoms among college students in China and the United States. Method: A total of 283 (45%) American and 343 (55%) Chinese students completed the Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS) and the Current Symptoms Scale (CSS), in addition to other measures. Results: Both of the ADHD measures appear to be reliable and valid, with good internal consistency, similar factor structures, and predicted relationships with other variables, such as depression and self-esteem. However, differences exist between the cultures in gender and overall reported symptom severity. Conclusion: ADHD symptomatology is present among college students in China in a pattern similar to that found in American college students. The WURS and the CSS appear to be effective screening measures for the disorder in China, although further research on gender and cultural differences is necessary. (J. of Att.

AB Family violence, including child sexual abuse (CSA), is a significant public health problem in the United States. It is particularly difficult to assess family violence and CSA among South Asians because it is often hidden due to cultural and familial stigma. A web-based survey was administered to a convenience sample (n = 368) of South Asian adults in the US. One-fourth (25.2 %) of the sample reported CSA; 13.8 % reported abuse involving exposure; 21.5 % reported abuse involving touching; 4.5 % reported attempted sexual intercourse; and 3.5 % reported forced sexual intercourse. Adjusted odds ratios found that participants who reported any relationship violence were significantly more likely to have experienced CSA (OR 2.28; 95 % CI 1.26-4.13); and suicide attempt was significantly associated with CSA (OR 3.96; 95 % CI 1.27-12.3). The findings presented in this formative study will assist in guiding future studies and interventions for South Asians in the United States.

AB This article uses decision analysis concepts and techniques to address an extremely important problem to any family with children, namely, how to avoid the tragic death of a child during the high-risk ages of 15-24. Descriptively, our analysis indicates that of the 35,000 annual deaths among this age group in the United States, approximately 20,000 could be avoided if individuals chose readily available alternatives for decisions relating to these deaths. Prescriptively, we develop a decision framework for parents and a child to both identify and proactively pursue decisions that can lower that child's exposure to life-threatening risks and positively alter decisions when facing such risks. Applying this framework for parents and the youth themselves, we illustrate the logic and process of generating proactive alternatives with numerous examples that each could pursue to lower these life-threatening risks and possibly avoid a tragic premature death, and discuss some public policy implications of our findings.

AB Objectives: The scientific community has recently taken a serious interest in the relation between religious involvement and adult mortality risk in the United States. We review this literature, highlighting key findings, limitations, and future challenges.
   Methods: Literature from medicine, epidemiology, and the social sciences is included.
   Results: Taken together, the existing research indicates that religious involvement is related to US adult mortality risks. The evidence is strongest for public religious attendance and across specific religious denominations. The evidence is weakest for private religious activity. The mechanisms by which religious involvement appear to influence mortality include aspects of social integration, social regulation, and psychological resources.
   Conclusions: The religion-mortality literature has developed in both size and quality over the past decade. Fruitful avenues for continued research include the analysis of (1) more dimensions of religious involvement, including religious life histories; (2) population subgroups, including specific race/ethnic and socioeconomic populations; and (3) a richer set of social, psychologic, and behavioral mechanisms by which religion may be related to mortality.

AB This article draws on ethnographic research on the implementation of Vermont's 2013 medical aid-in-dying (AID) law to explore a fundamental paradox: While public discourse characterizes AID as a mechanism for achieving an individually controlled autonomous death, the medico-legal framework that organizes it enlists social support and cultivates dependencies. Therefore, while patients pursuing AID may avoid certain types of dependency-such as those involved in bodily care-the process requires them to affirm and strengthen other bureaucratic, material, and affective forms. By tracing the social phenomenology of several AID deaths, I illustrate how AID results in distinctive forms of sociality and dependency that require terminally ill people and caregivers to embrace a collaborative stance toward choreographing death. I argue that assisted dying offers an opportunity to resist dominant U.S. cultural narratives that view dependency in purely negative terms and reimagine the relationships between disability, dependency, and care at the end of life.

TI National vehicle emissions policies and practices and declining US
   carbon monoxide-related mortality
SO JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; EXHAUST; DEATHS
AB Context Carbon monoxide (CO) has been reported to contribute to more than 2000 poisoning deaths per year in the United States.
   Objectives To evaluate the influence of national vehicle emissions policies and practices on CO-related mortality and to describe 31 years (1968-1998) of CO-related deaths in the United States.
   Design and Setting Longitudinal trend analysis using computerized death data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Census Bureau population data, and annual CO emissions estimates for light-duty vehicles provided by the US Environmental Protection Agency.
   Main Outcome Measure All deaths in the US for which non-fire-related CO poisoning was an underlying or contributing condition, classified by intent and mechanism of death. Negative binomial regression was used to incorporate every year of data into estimated percentage changes in CO emissions and mortality rates over time.
   Results During 1968-1998, CO-related mortality rates in the United States declined from 20.2 deaths to 8.8 deaths per 1 million person-years (an estimated decline of 57.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -62.4% to -52.6%). Following the introduction of the catalytic converter to automobiles in 1975, CO emissions from automobiles decreased by an estimated 76.3% of 1975 levels (95% Cl, -82.0% to -70.4%) and unintentional motor vehicle-related CO death rates declined from 4.0 to 0.9 deaths per 1 million person-years (an estimated decline of 81.3%; 95% Cl, -84.8% to -77.0%). Rates of motor vehicle-related CO suicides declined from 10.0 to 4.9 deaths per 1 million person-years (an estimated decline of 43.3%; 95% Cl, -57.5% to -24.3%). During 1975-1996, an annual decrease of 10 g/mile of estimated CO emissions from automobiles was associated with a 21.3% decrease (95% Cl, -24.2% to -18.4%) in the annual unintentional motor vehicle-related CO death rate and a 5.9% decrease (95% CI, -10.0% to -1.8%) in the annual rate of motor vehicle-related CO suicides.
   Conclusions If rates of unintentional CO-related deaths had remained at pre-1975 levels, an estimated additional 11700 motor vehicle-related CO poisoning deaths might have occurred by 1998. This decline in death rates appears to be a public health benefit associated with the enforcement of standards set by the 1970 Clean Air Act.

AB Introduction: The United States-Mexico border is perceived as dangerous by the media and current political leaders. Hispanic ethnicity, low socioeconomic status, male gender and adolescent age have previously been identified as risk factors for penetrating trauma (PT).
   Methods: A retrospective review of PT was performed in a border region. Children 0-17 years old, admitted to the region's only level I trauma center between 2001 and 2016 were included. Standardized morbidity ratio was used to compare observed to expected morbidity.
   Results: There were 417 PT admissions. 197 (47%) were non-accidental, 34 (8%) suicide attempts and 186 (45%) accidental. There were 12 homicides, 7 suicides and no accidental deaths. The region contains over 280,000 children, thus yielding a homicide rate of 0.26 per 100,000. The U.S. pediatric homicide rate was 2.6-4.0 over this period. Adolescents 13-17 years old accounted for 237 (57%) admissions, 152 (78%) of non-accidental admissions and 12 (63%) deaths. Most admissions (N = 321, 77%) and 15 of the deaths (79%) were males. Non-accidental injuries were more frequent in ZIP codes associated with low incomes. Hispanic patients accounted for 173 (88%) of non-accidental trauma. However, 40 (20%) non-accidental injuries occurred in Mexico and 157 (80%) injuries occurred in an 82% Hispanic region. Therefore, the standardized morbidity ratio for Hispanic ethnicity was 1.048 (CL 0.8-1.2, P = 0.6).
   Conclusion: On the United States-Mexico border, the pediatric homicide rate was less than 1/10 the national average. Male adolescents are at risk for non-accidental PT. In a Hispanic majority population, Hispanic ethnicity was not a risk factor for PT. It is possible that economic disparity, rather than race/ethnicity, is a risk factor for PT. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: Acculturation is the process by which immigrants acquire the culture of the dominant society. Little is known about the relationship between acculturation and suicidal ideation and attempts among US Hispanics. Our aim was to examine the impact of 5 acculturation measures (age at migration, time in the United States, social network composition, language, race/ethnic orientation) on suicidal ideation and attempts in the largest available nationally representative sample of US Hispanics.
   Method: Study participants were US Hispanics (N = 6,359) from Wave 2 of the 2004-2005 National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions (N = 34,653). We used linear chi(2) tests and logistic regression models to analyze the association between acculturation and risk of suicidal ideation and attempts.
   Results: Factors associated with a linear increase in lifetime risk for suicidal ideation and attempts were (1) younger age at migration (linear chi(2)(1) = 57.15; P < .0001), (2) longer time in the United States (linear chi(2)(1) = 36.09; P < .0001), (3) higher degree of English-language orientation (linear chi(2)(1) = 74.08; P < .0001), (4) lower Hispanic composition of social network (linear chi(2)(1) = 36.34; P < .0001), and (5) lower Hispanic racial/ethnic identification (linear chi(2)(1) = 47.77; P < .0001). Higher levels of perceived discrimination were associated with higher lifetime risk for suicidal ideation (beta = 0.051; P < .001) and attempts (beta = 0.020; P = .003).
   Conclusions: There was a linear association between multiple dimensions of acculturation and lifetime suicidal ideation and attempts. Discrimination was also associated with lifetime risk for suicidal ideation and attempts. Our results highlight protective aspects of the traditional Hispanic culture, such as high social support, coping strategies, and moral objections to suicide, which are modifiable factors and potential targets for public health interventions aimed at decreasing suicide risk. Culturally sensitive mental health resources need to be made more available to decrease discrimination and stigma.

AB Problem/Condition: In 2015, approximately 62,000 persons died in the United States as a result of violence-related injuries. This report summarizes data from CDC's National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) regarding violent deaths from 27 U.S. states for 2015. Results are reported by sex, age group, race/ethnicity, location of injury, method of injury, circumstances of injury, and other selected characteristics.
   Reporting Period: 2015.
   Description of System: NVDRS collects data regarding violent deaths obtained from death certificates, coroner/medical examiner reports, law enforcement reports, and secondary sources (e.g., child fatality review team data, supplemental homicide reports, hospital data, and crime laboratory data). This report includes data from 27 states that collected statewide data for 2015 (Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin). NVDRS collates documents for each death and links deaths that are related (e.g., multiple homicides, a homicide followed by a suicide, or multiple suicides) into a single incident.
   Results: For 2015, NVDRS captured 30,628 fatal incidents involving 31,415 deaths in the 27 states included in this report. The majority (65.1%) of deaths were suicides, followed by homicides (23.5%), deaths of undetermined intent (9.5%), legal intervention deaths (1.3%) (i.e., deaths caused by law enforcement and other persons with legal authority to use deadly force, excluding legal executions), and unintentional firearm deaths (<1.0%). (The term "legal intervention" is a classification incorporated into the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision [ICD-10] and does not denote the lawfulness or legality of the circumstances surrounding a death caused by law enforcement.) Demographic patterns varied by manner of death. Suicide rates were highest among males, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives, non-Hispanic whites, adults aged 45-54 years, and men aged >= 75years. The most common method of injury was a firearm. Suicides often were preceded by a mental health, intimate partner, substance abuse, or physical health problem, or a crisis during the previous or upcoming 2 weeks. Homicide rates were higher among males and persons aged <1 year and 20-34 years. Among males, non-Hispanic blacks accounted for the majority of homicides and had the highest rate of any racial/ethnic group. Homicides primarily involved a firearm, were precipitated by arguments and interpersonal conflicts, were related to intimate partner violence (particularly for females), or occurred in conjunction with another crime. When the relationship between a homicide victim and a suspected perpetrator was known, an acquaintance/friend or an intimate partner frequently was involved. Legal intervention death rates were highest among males and persons aged 20-54 years; rates among non-Hispanic black males were approximately double the rates of those among non-Hispanic white males. Precipitating circumstances for legal intervention deaths most frequently were an alleged criminal activity in progress, the victim reportedly using a weapon in the incident, a mental health or substance abuse problem (other than alcohol abuse), an argument or conflict, or a recent crisis (during the previous or upcoming 2 weeks). Unintentional firearm deaths were more frequent among males, non-Hispanic whites, and persons aged 10-24 years; these deaths most often occurred while the shooter was playing with a firearm and most often were precipitated by a person unintentionally pulling the trigger or mistakenly thinking the firearm was unloaded. Deaths of undetermined intent were more frequent among males, particularly non-Hispanic black and American Indian/Alaska Native males, and persons aged 30-54 years. Substance abuse, mental health problems, physical health problems, and a recent crisis were the most common circumstances preceding deaths of undetermined intent. In 2015, approximately 3,000 current or former military personnel died by suicide. The majority of these decedents were male, non-Hispanic white, and aged 45-74 years. Most suicides among military personnel involved a firearm and were precipitated by mental health, physical health, and intimate partner problems, as well as a recent crisis.
   Interpretation: This report provides a detailed summary of data from NVDRS for 2015. The results indicate that deaths resulting from self-inflicted or interpersonal violence most frequently affect males and certain age groups and minority populations. Mental health problems, intimate partner problems, interpersonal conflicts, and general life stressors were primary precipitating events for multiple types of violent deaths, including suicides among current or former military personnel.
   Public Health Action: NVDRS data are used to monitor the occurrence of violence-related fatal injuries and assist public health authorities in the development, implementation, and evaluation of programs and policies to reduce and prevent violent deaths. For example, Virginia VDRS data are used to help identify suicide risk factors among active duty service members, Oregon VDRS suicide data are used to coordinate information and activities across community agencies that support veterans and active duty service members, and Arizona VDRS data are used to develop recommendations for primary care providers who deliver care to veterans. The continued development and expansion of NVDRS to include all 50 states, U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia are essential to public health efforts to reduce deaths due to violence.

AB Background: In a classical study, Durkheim mapped suicide rates, wealth, and low family density and realized that they clustered in northern France. Assessing others variables, such as religious society, he constructed a framework for the analysis of the suicide, which still allows international comparisons using the same basic methodology. The present study aims to identify possible significantly clusters of suicide in the city of Sao Paulo, and then, verify their statistical associations with socio-economic and cultural characteristics.
   Methods: A spatial scan statistical test was performed to analyze the geographical pattern of suicide deaths of residents in the city of Sao Paulo by Administrative District, from 1996 to 2005. Relative risks and high and/or low clusters were calculated accounting for gender and age as co-variates, were analyzed using spatial scan statistics to identify geographical patterns. Logistic regression was used to estimate associations with socioeconomic variables, considering, the spatial cluster of high suicide rates as the response variable. Drawing from Durkheim's original work, current World Health Organization (WHO) reports and recent reviews, the following independent variables were considered: marital status, income, education, religion, and migration.
   Results: The mean suicide rate was 4.1/100,000 inhabitant-years. Against this baseline, two clusters were identified: the first, of increased risk (RR = 1.66), comprising 18 districts in the central region; the second, of decreased risk (RR = 0.78), including 14 districts in the southern region. The downtown area toward the southwestern region of the city displayed the highest risk for suicide, and though the overall risk may be considered low, the rate climbs up to an intermediate level in this region. One logistic regression analysis contrasted the risk cluster (18 districts) against the other remaining 78 districts, testing the effects of socioeconomic-cultural variables. The following categories of proportion of persons within the clusters were identified as risk factors: singles (OR = 2.36), migrants (OR = 1.50), Catholics (OR = 1.37) and higher income (OR = 1.06). In a second logistic model, likewise conceived, the following categories of proportion of persons were identified as protective factors: married (OR = 0.49) and Evangelical (OR = 0.60).
   Conclusions: This risk/ protection profile is in accordance with the interpretation that, as a social phenomenon, suicide is related to social isolation. Thus, the classical framework put forward by Durkheim seems to still hold, even though its categorical expression requires re-interpretation.

AB Background: Reducing access to lethal means (especially firearms) might prevent suicide, but counseling of at-risk individuals about this strategy may not be routine. Among emergency department (ED) patients with suicidal ideation or attempts (SI/SA), we sought to describe home firearm access and examine ED provider assessment of access to lethal means. Methods: This secondary analysis used data from the Emergency Department Safety Assessment and Follow-up Evaluation, a three-phase, eight-center study of adult ED patients with SI/SA (2010-2013). Research staff surveyed participants about suicide-related factors (including home firearms) and later reviewed the ED chart (including documented assessment of lethal means access). Results: Among 1,358 patients with SI/SA, 11% (95% CI: 10-13%) reported >= 1 firearm at home; rates varied across sites (range: 6-26%) but not over time. On chart review, 50% (95% CI: 47-52%) of patients had documentation of lethal means access assessment. Frequency of documented assessment increased over study phases (40-60%, P <.001) but was not associated with state firearm ownership rates. Among the 337 (25%, 95% CI: 23-27%) patients discharged to home, 55% (95% CI: 49-60%) had no documentation of lethal means assessment; of these, 13% (95% CI: 8-19%; n = 24) actually had >= 1 firearm at home. Among all those reporting >= 1 home firearm to study staff, only half (50%, 95% CI: 42-59%) had provider documentation of assessment of lethal means access. Conclusions: Among these ED patients with SI/SA, many did not have documented assessment of home access to lethal means, including patients who were discharged home and had >= 1 firearm at home.

AB Introduction: The Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) depression screener has been praised for its brevity and ability to identify depressed primary care patients. Additionally, it is often used as the first of a two-step screening process for suicide risk. Despite its decent performance as a depression screener, the PHQ-2 cannot be assumed to be an adequate screener for suicide risk. In the present study, we examine the utility of the PHQ-2 for identifying suicidal patients. Method: We examined data from 548 adult primary care patients at a Federally Qualified Health Center in the mid-Southern region of the United States who completed the PHQ-2 as part of the full administration of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Results: Cross-tabulation analyses revealed 22 of the 157 (14.0%) patients endorsing suicidal ideation fell below the conventional clinical cutoff of 3 on the PHQ-2. Logistic regression analyses indicated a positive screen on the PHQ-2 did not improve explanation of suicidal ideation beyond the base model, and only 3 items from the first 8 PHQ-9 questions (depressed mood, feeling like a failure, and psychomotor retardation/agitation) were significant explanatory variables for suicidal ideation. Discussion: Providers should consider asking about suicide directly, rather than relying on depression screeners to identify suicidal patients. We also recommend providers pay particular attention to any indication that patients feel like a failure or like they have let their loved ones down, in addition to endorsement of depressed mood.

AB Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, yet it remains difficult to understand the mechanistic provocations and to intervene therapeutically. Stress is recognized as a frequent precursor to suicide. Psychological stress is well established to cause activation of the inflammatory response, including causing neuroinflammation, an increase of inflammatory molecules in the central nervous system (CNS). Neuroinflammation is increasingly recognized as affecting many aspects of CNS functions and behaviors. In particular, much evidence demonstrates that inflammatory markers are elevated in traits that have been linked to suicidal behavior, including aggression, impulsivity and depression. Lithium is recognized as significantly reducing suicidal behavior, is anti-inflammatory and diminishes aggression, impulsivity and depression traits, each of which is associated with elevated inflammation. The anti-inflammatory effects of lithium result from its inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3). GSK3 has been demonstrated to strongly promote inflammation, aggressive behavior in rodents and depression-like behaviors in rodents, whereas regulation of impulsivity by GSK3 has not yet been investigated. Altogether, evidence is building supporting the hypothesis that stress activates GSK3, which in turn promotes inflammation, and that inflammation is linked to behaviors associated with suicide, including particularly aggression, impulsivity and depression. Further investigation of these links may provide a clearer understanding of the causes of suicidal behavior and provide leads for the development of effective preventative interventions, which may include inhibitors of GSK3.
