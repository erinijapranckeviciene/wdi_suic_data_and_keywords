AB Purpose Intimate partner violence (IPV) represents a widespread social and public health problem. Researchers have been shown association between IPV and mental health problems. The purpose of this paper is to present a review of the literature on relationship between wide ranges of mental health problems.
   Design/methodology/approach Research papers related to mental health problems among IPV perpetrators and published in leading academic journals in UK and abroad from 1987 to 2017 were identified and reviewed.
   Findings Although there were some equivocal findings, the authors found that most of the available research suggests that there is a variety of psychological health problems among IPV perpetrators. Specifically, there was evidence of a significant relationship between anger problems, anxiety, depression, suicidal behaviour, personality disorders, alcoholism or problem gambling and perpetration of IPV. Results from analysed studies identified high rates of co-morbid disorders in IPV perpetrators.
   Practical implications The findings highlight the need for treatment services to undertake screening and assessment of wide range of psychological difficulties to be able to provide best treatment approaches.
   Originality/value To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review that has included studies evaluating various psychological health problems among perpetrators of IPV.

AB BACKGROUND: It is estimated that the number of older adults with mental illness will increase from 4 million in 1970 to 15 million by 2030. The cost of untreated mental illness in the United States is estimated to be >$100 billion annually and nearly half of that cost can be attributed to persons age >= 60. In this paper we present a comprehensive review of empiric data available on primary prevention for the most common psychiatric illnesses in this patient population.
   METHODS: We did an English language literature review of published studies and selected only those with the strongest emphasis on primary prevention for the most common psychiatric illnesses in older adults.
   RESULTS: Modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors and several primary prevention strategies have been described, several of them with positive outcomes mainly for depressive disorders and suicide. In conditions such as bipolar disorder, dementias, and geriatric schizophrenia, there is either a paucity of studies or no robust primary prevention strategies identified.
   CONCLUSIONS: Modification of risk factors, a healthy lifestyle that includes a healthy diet, exercise, socialization, and education are important aspects of primary prevention in elderly patients. Genetic engineering and vaccine therapies may open new and exciting opportunities for prevention of many psychiatric illnesses in the near future.

AB Context: Opioids represent a drug class that adolescents and young adults intentionally misuse and abuse. When taken on their own or with other substances in this manner, opioids pose an increased risk of overdose and potential death.
   Objective: To determine trends of opioid drug poisonings among adolescents and young adults in Ohio from 2002 to 2014 using Poison Control Center (PCC) data.
   Methods: Data were obtained from Ohio PCCs from 2002 to 2014 for opioid drug poisonings amongst 10-29 year olds. Trends were evaluated with Poisson regression. Ohio counties with higher opioid drug poisoning rates were identified using age-adjusted resident population estimates. Chi-square tests were conducted to compare these county rates to the Ohio rate.
   Results: Both unintentional and intentional Ohio PCC opioid drug poisonings peaked in 2009, and there were significant declines through 2014. Almost 40% of intentional opioid drug poisonings were for young adults aged 18-24 years. Suspected suicide poisonings were 64.9% female, misuse poisonings were 54.5% male, and abuse poisonings were 60.1% male. Commonly reported substances included tramadol, heroin, and acetaminophen combinations with hydrocodone or oxycodone. Benzodiazepines and ethanol were the most common substances reported in conjunction with opioids. The top four Ohio counties with significantly higher opioid drug poisoning rates than the state average in 2014 were Hamilton, Mahoning, Butler, and Fairfield.
   Conclusion: This study enhances the understanding of Ohio's opioid epidemic so that future prevention efforts and legislation can better target needed resources. Both males and females would benefit from opioid education early in their lives.

AB The decade between 1998 and 2008 saw rapid increases in research on adolescent sexual orientation development and related health issues, both in the quantity and in the quality of studies. While much of the research originated in North America, studies from other countries also contributed to emerging understanding of developmental trajectories and social influences on the health of sexual minority adolescents. This paper reviews the body of research from the past decade on adolescent sexual orientation, focused on issues of measurement, developmental trajectories, evidence related to health disparities, and the risks and protective factors that help explain the health and developmental challenges some lesbian, gay, and bisexual adolescents experience. Although many sexual minority adolescents face stigma and rejection within their families, their schools, or their communities, it should be noted that most successfully navigate the developmental tasks of adolescence and attain similar levels of health and well-being as their heterosexual peers, often despite the stigma and discrimination they encounter. Further research is needed to understand population trends as well as individual patterns of development, cultural variations in both development and health disparities, the interplay of general and unique risk factors that contribute to various health disparities and protective factors that buffer those risks, and interventions to promote the healthy development of sexual minority adolescents.

AB Background Little is known about the mental health of gay men and lesbians living in Europe.
   Aims To compare psychological status, quality of life and use of mental health services by lesbians and gay men with heterosexual people.
   Method Cross-sectional study in England and Wales using 'snowball' sampling.
   Results Participants: 656 gay men, 505 heterosexual men, 430 lesbians and 588 heterosexual women. Gay men were more likely than heterosexual men to score above threshold on the Clinical Interview Schedule, indicating greater levels of psychological distress (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.07-1.43), as were lesbians compared with heterosexual women (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.11-1.52). Gay men and lesbians were more likely than heterosexuals to have consulted a mental health professional in the past, deliberately harmed themselves and used recreational drugs. Lesbians were more likely to have experienced verbal and physical intimidation and to consume more alcohol than heterosexual women.
   Conclusions Awareness of mental health issues for gay men and lesbians should become a standard part of training for mental health professionals, who need to be aware of the potential for substance misuse and self-harm in this group and of the discrimination experienced by many lesbians.

AB Bridging the gap between graduation from medical school and being board eligible in a medical specialty is a lengthy and arduous process. The fact that stress is typical during the residency training period is well-documented in the literature, as are its many situational, professional, and personal sources, which the author reviews: heavy workload, sleep deprivation, difficult patients, poor learning environments, relocation issues, isolation and social problems, financial concerns, cultural and minority issues, information overload, and career planning issues. Stress can also stem from and exacerbate gender-related issues and problems for significant others, spouses, and family members. The author also describes less commonly documented sources of stress-often overlooked or postponed so long that stresses are inevitable for all concerned. These are associated with residents who perform marginally and in some cases should not have been passed on from medical school, or who are studying specialties not compatible with their skills and personalities, or who foster severe interpersonal problems on the job. Common effects of stress include anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive trends, hostility, and alcohol and substance abuse.
   To respond to the problems that these many stressors present to residents, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) requires that all post-medical-school medical training programs make assistance services available for all residents. The author outlines essential elements of an assistance program, states how important such problems can be in saving both residents and their institutions needless difficulties and costs, and presents important issues for the consideration of all involved in residents' training.

ID GUN OWNERSHIP; RISK-FACTOR; SUICIDE; HOMICIDE; FIREARMS; HOME
AB Background: Mass shootings are common in the United States. They are the most visible form of firearm violence. Their effect on personal decisions to purchase firearms is not well-understood.
   Objective: To determine changes in handgun acquisition patterns after the mass shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012 and San Bernardino, California, in 2015.
   Design: Time-series analysis using seasonal autoregressive integrated moving-average (SARIMA) models.
   Setting: California.
   Population: Adults who acquired handguns between 2007 and 2016.
   Measurements: Excess handgun acquisitions (defined as the difference between actual and expected acquisitions) in the 6-week and 12-week periods after each shooting, overall and within subgroups of acquirers.
   Results: In the 6 weeks after the Newtown and San Bernardino shootings, there were 25 705 (95% prediction interval, 17 411 to 32 788) and 27 413 (prediction interval, 15 188 to 37 734) excess acquisitions, respectively, representing increases of 53% (95% CI, 30% to 80%) and 41% (CI, 19% to 68%) over expected volume. Large increases in acquisitions occurred among white and Hispanic persons, but not among black persons, and among persons with no record of having previously acquired a handgun. After the San Bernardino shootings, acquisition rates increased by 85% among residents of that city and adjacent neighborhoods, compared with 35% elsewhere in California. Limitations: The data relate to handguns in 1 state. The statistical analysis cannot establish causality.
   Conclusion: Large increases in handgun acquisitions occurred after these 2 mass shootings. The spikes were short-lived and accounted for less than 10% of annual handgun acquisitions statewide. Further research should examine whether repeated shocks of this kind lead to substantial increases in the prevalence of firearm ownership.

AB The objective of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the relationships of anger, self-esteem, and depression with suicidal ideation. A survey was conducted in a wide range of community areas across Jeollabuk-do Province, Korea. A total of 2964 subjects (mean age=44.4 yr) participated in this study. Hierarchical regression was used to investigate predictors of suicidal ideation in terms of their sociodemographic characteristics, depression, self-esteem, and anger. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that anger and self-esteem were significantly associated with suicidal ideation regardless of age and after controlling for depression. Moderation analysis showed that the impact of anger on suicidal ideation was significantly greater among females than males in adolescents, but not in other age groups. Additionally, there were some differences in sociodemographic predictors of suicidal ideation among age groups. Predictors included gender and family harmony in adolescents, marital status and family harmony in middle-aged individuals, and economic status and family harmony in elderly individuals. Our results revealed that anger and self-esteem play important roles in suicidal ideation beyond the effect of depression. Development and implementation of preventive strategies, including management of anger and self-esteem, could possibly reduce suicidal ideation and subsequent suicide attempts.

AB This study tested three hypotheses derived from the application of socioemotional selectivity theory and exchange theory to the exchange of emotional support with age and its relationship with positive and negative affect by age. Data are from the Midlife in the United States study of 3,032 U.S. adults between the ages of 25 and 74. The social contact hypothesis predicts that hours of emotional support given and received should decrease with age. The exchange hypothesis predicts that the discrepancy between the hours of emotional support given and received should decrease with age to reflect more balanced exchanges with age. The goal hypothesis predicts that unequal exchanges of support should predict higher negative and lower positive affect with age. Findings supported each hypothesis. Hours of emotional support given and received decreased as chronological age increased. Although adults of all ages gave more support than they received, the discrepancy between hours of emotional support given and received became more balanced with age. Compared with equal exchanges, unequal exchanges predicted worse emotional well-being profiles only among the oldest adults in this study (i.e., those, aged 55-64 and 65-74). Findings contribute to the growing literature on the changing nature of the quantity and quality of interpersonal exchanges with age.

AB Injuries continue to place a tremendous burden on the public's health and rates vary widely among different groups in the population. Increasing attention has recently been given to the effects of socioeconomic status (SES) as a determinant of health among both individuals and communities. However, relatively few studies have focused on the influence of SES and injuries. Furthermore, those that have, and the other injury studies that have included measures of SES in their analysis, have varying degrees of conceptual and methodological rigor in their use of this measure. Recent advances in data linkage and analytic techniques have, however, provided new and improved methods to assess the relationship between SES and injuries. This review summarizes the relevant literature on SES and injuries, with particular attention to study design, and the measurement and interpretation of SES. We found that increasing SES has a strong inverse association with the risk of both homicide and fatal unintentional injuries, although the results for suicide were mixed. However, the relationship between SES and nonfatal injuries was less consistent than for fatal injuries. We offer potential explanatory mechanisms for the relationship between SES and injuries and make recommendations for future research in this area.

AB Gay, and bisexual men carry, the burden of HIV infections in the United States and have high rates of childhood sexual abuse that predict HIV and other health outcomes. This study examined differential effects of forced, consensual, and no childhood sexual experiences (CSE) on health outcomes among a probability sample of adult men who have sex with men (MSM). The forced sex group had the highest levels of psychological distress, substance use, and HIV risk. There were no differences in rates of depression and suicidal ideation between the consensual- and no-sex groups. The consensual- and forced-sex groups had higher rates of substance use and transmission risk than the no-sex group. The forced-sex group, however, had significantly higher rates of frequent drug use and high-risk sex than the consensual group. Findings suggest that forced CSEs result in a higher-risk profile than consensual or no childhood sexual experiences, the kind of risk pattern differs between forced and consensual childhood sexual experiences, and the underlying mechanisms that maintain risk patterns may vary. It is important to clarify risk patterns and mechanisms that maintain them differentially for forced and consensual sex groups so that interventions may be tailored to the specific trajectories related to each experience.

AB Background: Recently, an emerging group of studies has reported the association between Body Mass Index (BMI) and suicidal ideation in the Western countries. However, this relationship is still unclear with controversial results, and we have little knowledge about this relationship in China which is one of few countries reported higher suicide rates.
   Methods: This study aims to analyze the association between BMI and suicidal ideation among seniors (60 years old) in Shandong, China. A total of 3313 seniors were included in the data analysis. Suicidal ideation, weight, height, socio-demographic and psychological variables were evaluated in this study. Logistic regression was conducted to explore the association between BMI and suicidal ideation among male and female seniors.
   Results: The results showed that 42% of the seniors reported suicidal ideation, and 3.4% for men, 4.9% for women. After controlling social-demographic variables, economic status, physical disease, social support and mental health, an inverse relationship between BMI and suicidal ideation was found for men, but not for women. Mental health was still an important factor associated with suicidal ideation.
   Conclusion: The results inform health care professors that underweight in male seniors can be associated with higher risk of suicidal ideation in China. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective. Provide a recent update in the trends of suicidal ideation among adults in the United States from 2005 to 2012.
   Methods. : Data from four 2-year cycles (2005-2012) of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were used (analyzed in 2015). Suicidal ideation was assessed via self-report.
   Results. For the entire sample, as well as across age-groups, gender and race-ethnicity, there was no statistically significant change in "any suicidal ideations" from 2005-2006 to 2011-2012 (2.95% in 2005-2006 to 324% in 2011-2012; P-trend(linear) = 0.75). However, significant changes in suicidal ideations occurring nearly every day were observed. A linear trend (P = 0.03) was present for the entire sample and for men; among the entire sample, the prevalence of having suicidal ideations nearly every day increased from 0.19% in 2005-2006 to 052% in 2011-2012. However, a quadratic trend was present for non-Hispanic white women (P = 0.03) and Mexican American women (P = 0.001).
   Conclusion. Suicidal ideation occurring nearly every day has increased for men, but recent decreases have been observed for women of non-Hispanic white and Mexican American race-ethnicity. Continued outreach efforts, particularly among men, are needed to help prevent the development of suicidal ideations into suicidal behavior and occurrence. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper establishes a modeling framework for alcohol abuse that allows evaluation of interventions meant to reduce adverse effects of alcohol overuse without the financial, social and other costs of imposing interventions that are ultimately ineffective (or even simply not cost effective). The framework is ecological (individual agents and their activities are represented), stochastic (neither individual behavior nor consequences of interventions are certain) and flexible.
   In the developed world such as the United States, based on Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost [Ezz02], alcohol is the third leading cause of mortality and morbidity. Much of the mortality and morbidity is associated intentional acts (for example violence, suicide) and unintentional injuries (for example, crashes, falls, burns) as a result of drinking behavior. Interventions designed to reduce both chronic and acute mortality and morbidity associated with alcohol use may be effective in limited circumstances. However, often suppressing one negative outcome can have the impact of increasing other negative outcomes. This paper discusses a systemic approach to understanding the complex interactions and consequently exploring the effect of interventions within sectors of the complex ecological-like system that surrounds users and abusers of alcohol. The tool that we have developed effectively allows the investigator to play the "what if" games to find improved strategies and subsequently design intervention strategies toward accomplishing the desired reductions in negative outcomes.

AB A growing body of evidence documents how economic crises impact aspects of health across countries and over time. We performed a systematic narrative review of the health effects of the latest economic crisis based on studies of high-income countries. Papers published between January 2009 and July 2015 were selected based on review of titles and abstracts, followed by a full text review conducted by two independent reviewers. Ultimately, 122 studies were selected and their findings summarized. The review finds that the 2008 financial crisis had negative effects on mental health, including suicide, and to a varying extent on some non-communicable and communicable diseases and access to care. Although unhealthy behaviors such as hazardous drinking and tobacco use appeared to decline during the crisis, there have been increases in some groups, typically those already at greatest risk. The health impact was greatest in countries that suffered the largest economic impact of the crisis or prolonged austerity. The Great Recessions in high-income countries have had mixed impacts on health. They tend to be worse when economic impacts are more severe, prolonged austerity measures are implemented, and there are pre-existing problems of substance use among vulnerable groups.

AB Firearms are the source of a significant number of preventable injuries and deaths to children. The risk of homicide, suicide, and unintentional deaths and injuries is greater when a firearm is present, particularly when the firearm is stored unsafely. Up to 40% of children have access to firearms in their homes, and adolescents have greater access across a wider domain of areas. Children's (especially boys') fascination with guns has been well-documented and appears resistant to intervention. Young children lack the cognitive maturity to generalize lessons teamed in the classroom to the real world of their homes and play areas. Older children and adolescents believe themselves to be invulnerable to injury and are easily persuaded by their peers to act in defiant and reckless ways. The interventions themselves are rarely based on sound behavioral principles, lack adequate evaluation criteria, and may promote a gun-carrying norm. Community-based education, media campaigns, access prevention laws, and physician-based counseling also appear to have little significant impact on gun ownership and safe storage practices of parents. Prevention of firearm injuries and deaths among children and adolescents needs to be depoliticized and refrained as a public health issue. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB On Tuesday morning, September 11, 2001, 19 suicide hijackers took control of four United States commercial airplanes and crashed them, respectively, into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center (WTC) in New York City, the Pentagon in Washington, DC, and in a field in Somerset County, west of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. An estimated 5000-6000 people were killed. The cost of the tragedy, in terms of rebuilding, is estimated at about $105 billion (CNN Television News Report, October 5, 2001). The tourism industry in America was severely affected, with immediate declines in airline passenger loads of 50% and more, and similar declines in hotel occupancy.
   This article describes the impacts of the September 11 terrorist attacks on the travel and tourism industry in the USA. It is compiled from the wealth of secondary data published in the print media, news reports on major television networks in the USA (e.g., ABC, CBS, NBC, and CNN), and informal discussions with 50 Executive MBA students and 21 faculty members at a university in the southeastern part of the USA. It is divided into six parts: (1) background: sequence of events; (2) impacts on the travel and tourism industry; (3) managerial implications; (4) future research; (5) limitation; and (6) summary and conclusion.

AB Firearm injuries are the second most common cause of death in children who come to a trauma center, and pediatric surgeons provide crucial care for these patients. The American Pediatric Surgical Association (APSA) is committed to comprehensive pediatric trauma readiness, including firearm injury prevention. APSA supports a public health approach to firearm injury, and it supports availability of quality mental health services. APSA endorses policies for universal background checks, restrictions on assault weapons and high capacity magazines, strong child access protection laws, and a minimum purchase age of 21 years. APSA opposes efforts to keep physicians from counseling children and families about firearms. APSA promotes research to address this problem, including increased federal research support and research into the second victim phenomenon. APSA supports school safety and readiness, including bleeding control training. While it may be daunting to try to reduce firearm deaths in children, the US. has seen success in reducing motor vehicle deaths through a multidimensional approach - prevention, design, policy, behavior, trauma care. APSA believes that a similar public health approach can succeed to save children from death and injury from firearms. APSA is committed to building partnerships to accomplish this.

AB Pediatricians are the primary care providers for most children and adolescents in the United States,so they need to feel comfortable caring for children and teens with depression. This topic is an extremely important one because the top three reasons teens die or get injured are related to accidents (3.7 per 100,000 for those ages 5-14 years and 28.5 per 100,000 for those ages 15-24 years), suicide (1 per 100,000 in the younger age group, and 12.5 deaths per 100,000 in those ages 5-14 years), and homicide (0.7 per 100,000 in those age 5-14 years,and 10.8 per 100,000 in those age 15-24 years) Each year, 21% of children ages 9 to 17 years are diagnosed with a mental or addictive disorder associated with at least minimum impairment, with 11% of these children having significant functional impairment and another 5% demonstrating extreme functional impairment. We know that one-half of all lifetime cases of mental health disorders start by age 14 years. This includes serious adult psychiatric illnesses such as major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse. Three-quarters are present by age 24 years; therefore, interventions aimed at prevention or early treatment need to focus on youth. [Pediatr Ann.2018;47(7):e261-e265.]

AB Whether immigration increases crime has long been a source of political debate and scholarly interest. Despite widespread public opinion to the contrary, the weight of evidence suggests the most recent wave of U.S. immigration has not increased crime, and may have actually helped reduce criminal violence. However, with recent shifts in immigrant settlement patterns away from traditional receiving destinations, a series of contemporary studies suggests a more complicated immigration-crime relationship, whereby Latino immigration is said to increase violence in newer immigrant destinations (but not in established destinations) and has varied effects for different racial/ethnic groups. With few exceptions, these more recent studies rely on cross-sectional analyses, thus limiting their ability to examine the longitudinal nexus between Latino immigration and violent crime. This study brings to bear the first longitudinal data set to test the relationship between immigration and racial/ethnic homicide in U.S. metropolitan areas between 1990 and 2010. Results from bivariate longitudinal associations and multivariate fixed effects models are contrary to recent findings Latino immigration is generally associated with decreases in homicide victimization for whites, blacks, and Hispanics in both established and non established immigrant destinations, though these associations are not significant in all cases.

AB Background: Lesbian and bisexual (i.e., sexual minority) identity is more common among women veterans than among male veterans. Unique health issues have been identified among women veterans and among sexual minority women, but little is known about women who are both sexual minorities and veterans. This study aimed to compare demographic and health information from sexual minority women veterans with sexual minority women non-veterans and heterosexual women veterans.
   Methods: Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey data were pooled from ten U. S. states that elected to ask sexual identity during 2010. The analytic sample was comprised of women who identified both their sexual identity and veteran status (n = 1,908). Mental health indicators were frequent mental distress, sleep problems, low social/emotional support, and low satisfaction with life. Health risk indicators included current smoking, overweight, and obesity. Physical health status was defined by three components: disability requiring assistive equipment, > 14 days of poor physical health in the past 30 days, and activity limitations.
   Results: Compared with heterosexual women veterans, sexual minority women veterans had higher odds of mental distress (odds ratio [OR] = 3.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.61-5.70) and smoking (OR = 2.31, 95% CI: 1.19-4.48). After adjusting for demographic correlates, sexual minority women veterans had three times the odds of poor physical health (OR = 3.01, 95% CI: 1.51-5.99) than their sexual minority non-veteran peers.
   Conclusions: Results suggest sexual minority women veterans may experience unique health disparities relevant to provision of care in both Veterans Affairs (VA) and non-VA healthcare systems. Future research requires availability of data that include sexual minority status.

AB Physicians have unique opportunities to help prevent firearm violence. Concern has developed that federal and state laws or regulations prohibit physicians from asking or counseling patients about firearms and disclosing patient information about firearms to others, even when threats to health and safety may be involved. This is not the case. In this article, the authors explain the statutes in question, emphasizing that physicians may ask about firearms (with rare exceptions), may counsel about firearms as they do about other health matters, and may disclose information to third parties when necessary. The authors then review circumstances under which questions about firearms might be most appropriate if they are not asked routinely. Such circumstances include instances when the patient provides information or exhibits behavior suggesting an acutely increased risk for violence, whether to himself or others, or when the patient possesses other individual-level risk factors for violence, such as alcohol abuse. The article summarizes the literature on current physician practices in asking and counseling about firearms, which are done far less commonly than recommended. Barriers to engaging in those practices, the effectiveness of clinical efforts to prevent firearm-related injuries, and what patients think about such efforts and physicians who engage in them are discussed. Proceeding from the limited available evidence, the authors make specific recommendations on how physicians might counsel their patients to reduce their risk for firearm-related death or serious injury. Finally, the authors review the circumstances under which disclosure of patient information about firearms to third parties is supported by regulations implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.

AB Purpose: To examine associations between family meal frequency and developmental assets and high-risk behaviors among a national sample of adolescents.
   Methods: Anonymous surveys were distributed to 99,462 sixth to 12th grade students from public and alternative schools in 213 cities and 25 states across the United States. Logistic regression analyses tested differences in assets and high-risk behaviors by family dinner frequency.
   Results: Consistent positive associations were found between the frequency of family dinners and all developmental assets, including both external (e.g., support, boundaries and expectations; odds ratio [OR] 2.1-3.7) and internal assets (e.g., commitment to learning, positive values, social competencies, and positive identity; OR 1.8-2.6); relationships were attenuated, but remained significant after adjusting for demographics and general family communication and support. Consistent inverse relationships were found between the frequency of family dinners and all high-risk behaviors measured (i.e., substance use, sexual activity, depression/suicide, antisocial behaviors, violence, school problems, binge eating/purging, and excessive weight loss; OR .36-.58), relationships were attenuated, but remained significant after adjusting for demographics and family factors.
   Conclusions: The findings of the present study suggest that the frequency of family dinner is an external developmental asset or protective factor that may curtail high-risk behaviors among youth. Creative and realistic strategies for enhancing and supporting family meals, given the context within which different families live, should be explored to promote healthy adolescent development. Family rituals such as regular mealtimes may ease the stress of daily living in the fast-paced families of today's society. (c) 2006 Society for Adolescent Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Illinois public hospitalizations over a ten-year period were studied to determine the impact of recent immigration. The study also explored clinical and demographic differences between immigrant groups and native-born Americans. Methods: Information was collected from the state hospital Clinical Information System for 1993, 1998, and 2003. Variables included age, sex, race, marital status, education, diagnosis, length of stay, birthplace, citizenship, primary language, English proficiency, and availability of a Social Security number. Logistic multiple regression was used to analyze trends in the proportion of psychiatric admissions of foreign-born patients, with foreign born as the dependent variable and year as the independent variable. Chi square analysis was used for trends across time. Results: In the hospitalized population, the proportion of immigrants was 7.3% in 1993, 10.9% in 1998, and 13.1% in 2003. With covariates adjusted for, the average increase of 8.0% per year in the odds of being foreign born was statistically significant (odds ratio=1.08, 95% confidence interval=1.06-1.10). Nevertheless, the proportion of foreign-born hospital admissions, including Asian and Mexican immigrants, was below their population ratio in Illinois. Mexican-origin immigrants constituted the largest group of admissions and were younger, less educated, had poorer English skills, and were more likely to be undocumented than other immigrants. Conclusions: The percentage of foreign-born patients admitted was lower than their percentage in the overall population. In previous immigration waves, immigrants were hospitalized at disproportionately higher rates than nonimmigrants. The gap is slowly narrowing as new admissions are increasingly likely to be foreign born, suggesting that public psychiatric hospitals should prepare for these changing populations.

AB National statistics on female homicide could be a useful tool to evaluate the phenomenon and plan adequate strategies to prevent and reduce this crime. The aim of the study is to contribute to the analysis of intentional female homicides in Italy by comparing Italian trends to German and United States trends from 2008 to 2014. This is a population study based on data deriving primarily from national and European statistical institutes, from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reporting and from the National Center for Health Statistics. Data were analyzed in relation to trends and age by Chi-square test, Student's t-test and linear regression. Results show that female homicides, unlike male homicides, remained stable in the three countries. Regression analysis showed a higher risk for female homicide in all age groups in the U.S. Middle-aged women result at higher risk, and the majority of murdered women are killed by people they know. These results confirm previous findings and suggest the need to focus also in Italy on preventive strategies to reduce those precipitating factors linked to violence and present in the course of a relationship or within the family.

AB Empirical research is needed to support ongoing efforts to improve services for sexual and gender minority youth in foster care. Further, data on the presence of sexual and gender minority youth within the child welfare system are needed to encourage counties that have not yet begun to engage in any efforts to address the unique needs and barriers to permanency for these youth. The current study reports on the findings of the Los Angeles Foster Youth Survey (LAFYS) which was designed to assess the proportion of youth placed in the Los Angeles County public child welfare system who are LGBTQ and to examine their experiences in communities, schools, and foster care. Findings indicate that approximately 19% of Los Angeles foster youth are LGBTQ This proportion of youth is significantly higher than estimates of adolescent and young adult sexual and gender minority identification rates in the general population. Further, analyses also indicate that sexual and gender minority youth in this study are less satisfied with their child welfare system experience, are more likely to experience homelessness, are moved around to more placements, and are experiencing higher levels of emotional distress compared to their non-LGBTQ counterparts.

   DISORDERS; ANTIDEPRESSANTS; ASSOCIATION; REMISSION; CARE
AB In 2004, more people died in Europe from suicide than from road accidents. The lifetime prevalence of major depression is 20% for women and 10% for men. Depression is a leading cause of disability and decreased quality of life. In spite of this, numerous studies have shown that only similar to 50% of depressed patients are recognized as such in primary care. In a recent international survey of everyday management of depression we observed that only similar to 15% of patients became symptom-free following treatment. In spite of this low level of remission primary care physicians and psychiatrist only rarely increased the dose of antidepressant or switched to another medication as unanimously recommended by different guidelines. Numerous studies have demon strated the importance of maintaining treatment for >= 6 months after remission is obtained in order to prevent relapse and recurrence. However, a recent study reported that only 19% of a cohort of patients in primary care continued treatment for 6 months as recommended. Antidepressants can be very effective but only when used correctly at adequate doses and for a sufficient duration. Although new improved antidepressants are obviously desirable, a, greater recognition of depression and its treatment by the correct use of currently available antidepressant drugs could greatly improve the management of this major public health problem.

AB The paper analyses geographical variations in use of acute psychiatric inpatient services within New York City and how these have changed from 1990 to 2000. We review literature suggesting reasons for the variations observed. Data from the New York State Department of Health Statewide Planning Research and Cooperative System were combined with population census data to produce age standardized ratio indicators of admissions and of bed days, as measures of use of general hospitals for psychiatric conditions, by males aged 15-64, in Zip Code Areas of New York City, in 1990 and 2000. Geographical variations in hospital use were related to proximity to general hospitals with psychiatric beds and to socio-economic status of local populations (as recorded in the 1990 and 2000 population censuses). Areas close to psychiatric hospitals areas show high admission levels. Controlling for this, Zip Code Areas with higher concentrations of poverty, of African American residents or of persons living alone were associated with relatively high admission ratios. These relationships vary somewhat between diagnostic groups. Area inequalities in standardized admission ratios persisted and widened between 1990 and 2000, and the highest hospital admission ratios were increasingly concentrated where social and economic disadvantage was greatest. Various possible reasons for this trend are explored. We conclude that increasing intensity of poverty in disadvantaged areas is not likely to provide an explanation and that the trends are more likely to result from changes in hospital management and funding affecting access to hospital services.

AB This paper challenges the foundational claim that the human family is no more than a social construction. It advances the position that the family is a central category of experience, being, and knowledge. Throughout, the analysis argues for the centrality of the family for human flourishing and, consequently, for the importance of sustaining (or reestablishing) family-oriented practices within social policy, such as more family-oriented approaches to consent to medical treatment. Where individually oriented approaches to medical decision-making accent an ethos of isolated personal autonomy family-oriented approaches acknowledge the central social and moral reality of the family. I argue that the family ought to be appreciated as more than a mere network of personal relations and individual undertakings; the family possesses a being that is social and moral such that it realizes a particular structure of human good and sustains the necessary conditions for core areas of human flourishing. Moreover, since the family exists as a nexus of face-to-face relationships, the consent of persons, including adults, to be members of a particular family, subject to its own respective account of family sovereignty, is significantly more amply demonstrated than the consent of citizens to be under the authority of a particular state. As a result, in the face of a general Western bioethical affirmation of the autonomy of individuals, as if adults and children were morally and socially isolated agents, this paper argues that social space must nevertheless be made for families to choose on behalf of their own members.

AB In the USA, the use of advance directives (ADs) has been studied extensively, in order to identify opportunities to increase their use. We investigated the prevalence of ADs and the factors associated with formulation of an AD in The Netherlands, using samples of three groups: the general population up to 60 years of age, the general population over 60 years of age, and the relatives of patients who died after euthanasia or assisted suicide. The associated factors were grouped into three components: predisposing factors (e.g. age, gender), enabling factors (e.g. education) and need factors (e.g. health-related factors). We found that living wills had been formulated by 3% of younger people, 10% of older people, and 23% of the relatives of a person who died after euthanasia or assisted suicide. Most living wills concerned a request for euthanasia. In all groups, 26-29% had authorized someone to make decisions if they were no longer able to do so themselves. Talking to a physician about medical end-of-life treatment occurred less frequently, only 2% of the younger people and 7% of the older people had done so. Most people were quite confident that the physician would respect their end-of-life wishes, but older people more so than younger people. In a multivariate analysis, many predisposing factors were associated with the formulation of an AD: women, older people, non-religious people, especially those who lived in an urbanized area, and people with less confidence that the physician would respect their end-of-life wishes were more likely to have formulated an AD. Furthermore, the enabling factor of a higher level of education, the need factor of contact with a medical specialist in the past 6 months, and the death of a marital partner were associated with the formulation of an AD.

AB Background: Blast injuries in the United States and worldwide are not uncommon. Partially due to the increasing frequency of both domestic and international terrorist bombing attacks, it is prudent for all emergency physicians to be knowledgeable about blasts and the spectrum of associated injuries. Objective: Our aim was to describe blast physiology, types of blast injuries associated with each body system, and manifestations and management of each injury. Discussion: Blast injuries are generally categorized as primary to quaternary injuries. Primary injuries result from the effect of transmitted blast waves on gas-containing structures, secondary injuries result from the impact of airborne debris, tertiary injury results from transposition of the entire body due to blast wind or structural collapse, and quaternary injuries include almost everything else. Different body systems are affected and managed differently. Despite previous dogma, multiple studies now show that tympanic membrane perforation is a poor predictor of other blast injury. Conclusions: Blast events can produce a myriad of injuries affecting any and every body system. All emergency physicians should be familiar with the presentation and management of these injuries. This knowledge may also be incorporated into triage and discharge protocols guiding management of mass casualty events. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB Objectives. We examined relationships between parenting status and multiple forms of violence perpetration among young adults in high-poverty environments.
   Methods. We analyzed data obtained from a survey of 990 young adults in New York City. Respondents reported on violence they had perpetrated toward themselves, intimate partners, and others. Associations between parenting and violence were examined in logistic regressions, controlling for sociodemographics.
   Results. Fewer young men (33.0%) than young women (48.6%) reported that they were raising children. Among young men, parenting was associated with violence toward themselves (odds ratio [OR] = 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03, 3.16) but not with violence toward partners or others. Among young women, violence perpetration did not differ by parenting status. Correlations among forms of violence were higher among young women than among young men, especially among mothers. Community violence was associated with violence toward others for both genders. For young men, community violence was associated with violence toward partners.
   Conclusions. Parenting did not reduce inner-city young adults' perpetration of violence. Among fathers, parenting may be, along with unemployment, a risk for violence toward self. Understanding patterns of violence can inform interventions that support young adults, including those who are parenting, in creating nonviolent homes and communities.

AB To investigate the role of sociodemographic factors in the risk of death by homicide in Italy, official statistics from 1980 to 1994 concerning death by homicide have been studied. Homicide rates increase from 1980 to 1994 for males and, to a much lesser extent, for females. Clear differences exist by age and gender, with rates peaking in both genders at young adult age (25-34) and men having five times higher rates than women. Mean rate in the general population is 1.98 per 100,000, one of the highest rates in the civilized world. These findings are mostly influenced by higher homicide rates for both males and females in southern regions, where cultural attitudes towards violence, linked to the greater diffusion of criminal organizations, greatly influence the risk of death by homicide. About 75% of homicides involve firearms: clearly in Italy availability of lethal weapons is a key factor in homicide. Intervention aimed at increasing community awareness of the causes and methods of prevention of violence (including the roles of substance abuse and social inequality) are needed if adequate policies are to be developed to reduce the risk of death by homicide. Differences in homicide rates across countries clearly indicate that homicide is a preventable cause of death.

AB We describe the formation of the Initiative on Health, Religion, and Spirituality at Harvard University including the teaching, research, and institutional efforts at both the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the Harvard Medical School. A course has been offered on Religion and Public Health every second year at the School of Public Health and training programs for medical students, school of public health students, and residents are in place. Numerous students have been involved in the initiative's research projects. The initiative has also hosted numerous seminar series and conferences on religion, spirituality and health, and numerous students have participated in these as well. Research in public health has focused on religion and population health including the protective associations between religious service attendance and longevity, suicide, and depression, along with the use of longitudinal cohort studies to establish evidence for causality. Research within medicine has focused on the role of religion, spirituality, and spiritual care in end of life settings for patients, physicians, nurses, and clergy. The future goals of the program include establishing a stronger institutional base throughout Harvard University; sustained research, teaching, and training, and permanent funding for this; and broad influence on public health and medical teaching and practice within the United States and worldwide.

AB The psychological consequences of trauma exposure are well recognized throughout history. The study of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) dates back more than 100 years. Before 1980, post-traumatic syndromes were recognized by different names, including railway spine, shell shock, traumatic (war) neurosis, concentration-camp syndrome, and rape-trauma syndrome. The symptoms described in these syndromes overlap considerably with what we now recognize as PTSD. Individuals exposed to severe traumatic stress often develop comorbid PTSD and major depressive disorder (MDD). I developed a new concept suggesting that that some or all individuals diagnosed with comorbid PTSD and MDD have a separate psychobiological condition that can be termed "post-traumatic mood disorder" (PTMD). This concept is supported by a significant number of clinical, translational and other studies suggesting that patients suffering from comorbid PTSD and MDD are different clinically and biologically from individuals with PTSD alone or MDD alone. Patients with comorbid PTSD and MDD are characterized by greater impairment compared to individuals with PTSD alone or MDD alone. Neurobiological evidence supporting the concept of PTMD includes the findings related to dopaminergic, serotonergic, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and other observations. It is crucial to develop interventions to prevent and to treat PTMD and measures to prevent and to treat suicidal ideation and behavior in individuals with PTMD.

AB Background: Alcohol-related problems are increasing among Nigerian University students. However, very few studies have explored the ways in which hazardous drinking practices facilitate these problems in Nigerian University students, aside from quantitative studies focussing on students in South-Western Nigeria. Methods: Drawing on qualitative semi-structured interviews involving students from a South-Eastern Nigerian University, this study begins to address these gaps. The participants were recruited through convenience and snowballing sampling techniques, and the data were analysed thematically. Results: The findings show that 24 out of 31 participants engaged in heavy drinking by consuming between 3 and 9 bottles of beer/stout or flavoured spirits regularly. These heavy drinkers had suffered financial, academic, and health problems. Some lost valuable personal items such as mobile phones, wallets, and money as a result of drinking, while others missed examinations because drinking had rendered them either too ill or had caused them to oversleep and missed the examination. Almost all participants had suffered multiple health-related problems such as hangovers, accidents and injuries, liver enlargement, stomach ache, attempted suicide (under the influence of alcohol), and sex with strangers. Conclusion: Evidence-based public health interventions to address easy alcohol availability and heavy drinking should be implemented in Nigerian Universities.

AB There is increasing evidence and recognition that Lyme borreliosis (LB) causes mental symptoms. This article draws from databases, search engines and clinical experience to review current information on LB. LB causes immune and metabolic effects that result in a gradually developing spectrum of neuropsychiatric symptoms, usually presenting with significant comorbidity which may include developmental disorders, autism spectrum disorders, schizoaffective disorders, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety disorders (panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, intrusive symptoms), eating disorders, decreased libido, sleep disorders, addiction, opioid addiction, cognitive impairments, dementia, seizure disorders, suicide, violence, anhedonia, depersonalization, dissociative episodes, derealization and other impairments. Screening assessment followed by a thorough history, comprehensive psychiatric clinical exam, review of systems, mental status exam, neurological exam and physical exam relevant to the patient's complaints and findings with clinical judgment, pattern recognition and knowledgeable interpretation of laboratory findings facilitates diagnosis. Psychotropics and antibiotics may help improve functioning and prevent further disease progression. Awareness of the association between LB and neuropsychiatric impairments and studies of their prevalence in neuropsychiatric conditions can improve understanding of the causes of mental illness and violence and result in more effective prevention, diagnosis and treatment.

AB Depigmentation in vitiligo occurs by progressive loss of melanocytes from the basal layer of the skin, and can be psychologically devastating to patients. T cell-mediated autoimmunity explains the progressive nature of this disease. Rather than being confronted with periods of rapid depigmentation and bouts of repigmentation, patients with long-standing, treatment-resistant vitiligo can undergo depigmentation treatment. The objective is to remove residual pigmentation to achieve a cosmetically acceptable result - that of skin with a uniform appearance. In the United States, only the use of mono-benzyl ether of hydroquinone (MBEH) is approved for this purpose. However, satisfactory results can take time to appear, and there is a risk of repigmentation. MBEH induces necrotic melanocyte death followed by a cytotoxic T-cell response to remaining, distant melanocytes. As cytotoxic T-cell responses are instrumental to depigmentation, we propose that combining MBEH with immune adjuvant therapies will accelerate immune-mediated melanocyte destruction to achieve faster, more definitive depigmentation than with MBEH alone. As Toll-like Receptor (TLR) agonists - imiquimod, CpG, and Heat Shock Protein 70 (HSP 70) - all support powerful Th1 responses, we propose that using MBEH in combination with these agents can achieve superior depigmentation results for vitiligo patients.

   BEHAVIOR
AB Treatment-resistant depression, a chronic condition that affects 30% of depressed patients on antidepressants, is highly linked to suicidal behavior. Chronic hypoxia exposure via living at altitude (hypobaric hypoxia) or with chronic hypoxic diseases is demographically linked to increased risk for depression and suicide. We previously demonstrated that housing rats at altitude for a week incrementally increases depression-like behavior in the forced swim test (FST) in females, but not males. In animal models, high altitude exposure reduces brain serotonin, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can lose efficacy when brain serotonin levels are low. To address whether residence at moderate altitude is detrimental to SSRI function, we examined SSRI efficacy in the FST after a week of housing rats at altitudes of 4500 ft. or 10,000 ft. as compared to at sea level. In females, the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine (positive control) functioned well in all groups, increasing latency to immobility and decreasing immobility, by increasing climbing. However, the SSRIs fluoxetine, paroxetine and escitalopram were ineffective in females in all groups: only paroxetine improved swimming in the FST as expected of a SSRI, while all three unexpectedly reduced climbing. Fluoxetine was also ineffective in male rats. Sertraline was the only SSRI with antidepressant efficacy at altitude in both females and males, increasing swimming, climbing and latency to immobility, and reducing immobility. Hypobaric hypoxia thus appears to be detrimental to efficacy of the SSRIs fluoxetine, paroxetine and escitalopram, but not of sertraline. Unlike the other SSRIs, sertraline can improve both serotonergic and dopaminergic transmission, and may be less impacted by a hypoxia-induced serotonin deficit. A targeted approach may thus be necessary for successful antidepressant treatment in patients with depression who live at altitude or with chronic hypoxic diseases, and that sertraline may be the SSRI of choice for prescription for this population.

AB Background: Most studies of readmission after trauma are limited to single institutions or single states. The purpose of this study was to determine the risk factors for readmission after trauma for mental illness including readmissions to different hospitals across the United States.
   Materials and methods: The Nationwide Readmission Database for 2013 and 2014 was queried for all patients aged 13 to 64 y with a nonelective admission for trauma and a nonelective readmission within 30 d. Multivariable logistic regression was performed for readmission for mental diseases and disorders.
   Results: During the study period, 53,402 patients were readmitted within 30 d after trauma. The most common major diagnostic category on readmission was mental diseases and disorders (12.1%). The age group with the highest percentage of readmissions for mental diseases and disorders was 13 to 17 y (38%). On multivariable regression, the teenage group was also the most likely to be readmitted for mental diseases and disorders compared to 18-44 y (odds ratio [OR] 0.45, P < 0.01) and 45-64 y (OR 0.24, P < 0.01). Other high-risk comorbidities included HIV infection (OR 2.4, P < 0.01), psychosis (OR 2.2, P < 0.01), drug (OR 2.0, P < 0.01), and alcohol (OR 1.4, P < 0.01) abuse.
   Conclusions: Teenage trauma patients are at increased risk for hospital readmission for mental illness. Efforts to reduce these admissions should be targeted toward individuals with high-risk comorbidities such as HIV infection, psychosis, and substance abuse. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Purpose: To compare the prevalence of selected risk behaviors among Asian American/Pacific Islander (AAPI) students and white, black, and Hispanic high school students in the United States.
   Methods: The national Youth Risk Behavior Survey conducted in 1991, 1993, 1995, and 1997 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention produced nationally representative samples of students in grades 9 through 12 in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. To generate a sufficient sample of AAPI students, data from these four surveys were combined into one dataset yielding a total sample size of 55,734 students.
   Results: In the month preceding the survey, AAPI students were significantly less likely than black, Hispanic, or white students to have drunk alcohol or used marijuana. AAPI students also were significantly less likely than white, black, or Hispanic students to have had sexual intercourse; however, once sexually active, AAPI students were as likely as other racial or ethnic groups to have used alcohol or drugs at last intercourse or to have used a condom at last intercourse. AAPI students were significantly less likely than white, black, or Hispanic students to have carried a weapon or fought but were as likely as any of the other groups to have attempted suicide.
   Conclusions: A substantial percentage of AAPI students engage in risk behaviors that can affect their current and future health. Prevention programs should address the risks faced by AAPI students using culturally sensitive strategies and materials. More studies are needed to understand the comparative prevalence of various risk behaviors among AAPI subgroups.

AB Purpose: To examine the trends in injury mortality among young people aged 15-24 years residing in the 15 current member states of the European Union between 1984 and 1993.
   Methods: As part of a European Commission-funded project entitled European Review of Injury Surveillance and Control (EURORISC), mortality data for all externally caused physical injuries (International Classification of Disease Codes E800-999) were obtained from the World Health Organization. Data were analyzed to generate age-specific injury mortality rates and proportional differences in rates over the study period. Linear regression was used to represent the linear component of the mortality profile.
   Results: Almost a quarter of a million young people died as a result of sustaining an externally caused physical injury (either unintentional or intentional) in the study countries between 1984 and 1993. Injury accounted for two-thirds of all deaths in this age group. Over three-quarters (76%) of deaths were due to unintentional injury, a further 17% to self-inflicted injuries, and the remaining 7% to homicide and other violent causes. Motor vehicle traffic fatalities accounted for 84% of unintentional injury deaths. Although a decline in injury mortality was observed throughout Europe, rates of mortality owing to both unintentional injuries and suicide varied widely among study countries at both the beginning and end of the study period.
   Conclusions: Whereas injury mortality rates in young people in most European countries are lower than in other parts of the world (including the United States), injuries represent a major public health problem in the European Union. The death toll from motor vehicle traffic crashes is a particular cause for concern. (C) Society for Adolescent Medicine 2000.

AB Because of the great morbidity and mortality associated with bipolar disorder, long-term treatment is necessary to prevent recurrence and reduce the loss of productivity and increased medical costs associated with this illness. The agent with the most evidence of efficacy and the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved medication for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder is lithium. Lithium may cause a prophylactic response in more than two thirds of patients with bipolar disorder and reduce suicide risk by more than 8-fold. However, lithium may be more effective for patients with classical features such as fully remitting courses and typical manic symptoms than for patients with nonclassical bipolar features such as mixed states and rapid cycling. Because lithium may be toxic at only twice the therapeutic dose, physicians should consider patients' ages and medical history when prescribing this drug. Monitoring requirements; possible side effects; changes in the illness including more treatment-resistant forms; and the introduction of newer agents, which are supported by more marketing and continuing medical education programs than the essentially generic drug lithium, have contributed to the decline in lithium prescription rates in the last 15 years in the United States. However, long-term treatment with lithium continues to be effective in many patients, especially if the dose is periodically evaluated as patients experience changes in their physical health and lithium tolerance. Until newer agents have comparable evidence of efficacy, lithium will be considered a first-line long-term treatment for bipolar disorder, either as monotherapy or in combination therapy.

AB Suicide rates are higher at high altitudes, and some hypothesize that hypoxia is the cause. There may be a significant correlation between rates of depression and altitude, but little data exist outside the United States. The purpose of the present study is to conduct a survey of depression among the elderly highlanders in Asia. We enrolled 114 persons aged 60 years or older (mean, 69.2 +/- A 6.7 years; women, 58.8 %) in Domkhar (altitude, 3800 m), Ladakh, India and 173 ethnic Tibetans (mean, 66.5 +/- A 6.1 years; women, 61.3 %) in Yushu (altitude, 3700 m), Qinghai Province, China. The two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) and the geriatric depression scale were administered. A psychiatrist interviewed the subjects who had a positive score on the PHQ-2. The results of the interview with the residents conducted by the specialist showed that two cases (1.8 %) from Domkhar and four (2.3 %) from Qinghai had depression. Despite the high altitude, the probability of depression was low in elderly highlander in Ladakh and Qinghai. Our finding seems to indicate that cultural factors such as religious outlook and social/family relationship inhibit the development of depression.

AB Objectives: To examine health indicators of same-sex partnered veterans as compared with their opposite-sex partnered veteran and nonveteran peers. Methods: Same-sex partner status was derived by self-reported same-sex partnerships in data from the 2004 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Outcome variables included health risk disparities associated with sexual minority status (e.g., frequent mental distress) and veteran status (e.g., firearm ownership). Stratified multiple logistic regression models were used to examine the association of same-sex partnered veteran status with health, indicators. Results: Same-sex partnered veterans had higher odds of being overweight and keeping firearms in the house compared with same-sex partnered nonveterans. Same-sex partnered veterans were less likely than opposite-sex partnered veterans to be overweight, and they were more than twice as likely to be current smokers when compared with opposite-sex partnered nonveterans. Conclusions: Findings suggest both that some health disparities patterns identified by same-sex partnership status among the general population also exist among veteran populations, and that some unique distinctions may exist, particularly related to BMI and firearm ownership. Collection of information about sexual minority status within Department of Veterans Affairs data sources is needed to more accurately assess the health of this minority population.

AB Background: The objective was to investigate the relationship of high gun ownership and gun death rate on children and determine predictors influencing the incidence and outcome of pediatric firearm injuries in a major pediatric level 1 trauma center.
   Methods: We performed a retrospective review of our trauma registry to identify hospital admissions between April 1999 and March 2010. We extracted demographic and geographic data, seasonal variation, injury type, firearm type, and outcome.
   Results: We identified 194 firearm injuries. The incidence did not change during the past decade. Most occurred during the second half of the year (61.4%). Mean age was 12.2 +/- 4.6 years (range, 0.4-19.2 years). Unintentional shootings accounted for 100 injuries followed by assaults (n = 55) and innocent bystanders (n = 39). African American children were most often injured because of a violent cause (60.3%), whereas white children were shot unintentionally (80.1%). Powder-propelled firearms caused 82.5% of injuries. Overall, 17.5% of children required an operation, and 9.3% died.
   Conclusions: The overwhelming majority of children were injured after a gun went off unintentionally, whereas most African American children were shot violently. We identified certain seasonal and geographic clusters. These data can be used to target gun injury prevention programs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Firearms injuries place a unique burden on America in terms of lives lost (31,000/year), disability (70,000 nonfatal injuries/year), and economic costs ($174 billion in 2010). The purpose of this study was to examine psychiatric residency directors' perceptions of firearm access issues of the mentally ill. In late Fall 2012 and early Spring of 2013, a three-wave mailing was used to survey the membership of the American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training (N = 129). Due to the homogenous small sample size descriptive statistics were calculated to describe the responses. A total of 72 (56 %) directors responded. Almost 1 in 4 (23.6 %) thought that access to firearms by the seriously mentally ill should not be prohibited. The majority (91.7 %) supported closing the background check loophole. The majority (54.2 %) also believed that singling out the mentally ill as a group of "banned purchasers" adds to the stigma of the mentally ill (54.2 %) but a plurality (44.4 %) did not believe reporting the mentally ill to authorities would result in the mentally ill avoiding treatment. The current method of reducing access by the mentally ill to firearms is perceived by psychiatric residency directors as ineffective and burdensome to the mentally ill.

AB Background: Little is known about how often physicians are formally accused of hastening patient deaths while practicing palliative care.
   Methods: We conducted an Internet-based survey on a random 50% sample of physician-members of a national hospice and palliative medicine society.
   Results: The final sample consisted of 663 physicians (response rate 53%). Over half of the respondents had had at least one experience in the last 5 years in which a patient's family, another physician, or another health care professional had characterized palliative treatments as being euthanasia, murder, or killing. One in four stated that at least one friend or family member, or a patient had similarly characterized their treatments. Respondents rated palliative sedation and stopping artificial hydration/nutrition as treatments most likely to be misconstrued as euthanasia. Overall, 25 physicians (4%) had been formally investigated for hastening a patient's death when that had not been their intention-13 while using opiates for symptom relief and six for using medications while discontinuing mechanical ventilation. In eight (32%) cases, another member of the health care team had initiated the charges. At the time of the survey, none had been found guilty, but they reported experiencing substantial anger and worry.
   Conclusions: Commonly used palliative care practices continue to be misconstrued as euthanasia or murder, despite this not being the intention of the treating physician. Further efforts are needed to explain to the health care community and the public that treatments often used to relieve patient suffering at the end of life are ethical and legal.

AB Objective. In this study we examined firearm storage patterns and their associations in a diverse sample of families who attended pediatric practices from both rural and nonrural areas across the United States.
   Methods. Parents who brought their children who were aged 2 to 11 years (N = 3745) to 96 Pediatric Research in Office Settings practices from 45 states, Canada, and Puerto Rico participated in an office-based survey before a well-child examination. The survey measured demographic variables; family history of guns in the home; and firearm types, storage behaviors, and ownership.
   Results. Twenty-three percent of families reported firearm ownership. The majority (60%) of respondents reported making firearm storage decisions. Only one third of firearm owners reported safe firearm storage. Gun type owned was associated with storage habits, with long-gun owners storing their gun in places other than locked cabinets but with ammunition separate from guns and handgun users more likely to store guns loaded and to use gun locks. In a multivariate analysis, not being raised with a firearm was associated with safe storage behaviors. Families who had children aged 2 to 5 years and owned long guns were more likely to store their guns safely than families with older children.
   Conclusions. Few families reported safe firearm storage. Storage patterns are most influenced by firearm type(s) owned, family socialization with guns, and the age of the child. Primary care providers need to understand better not only whether firearms are in the home but also which types are present and whether parents were raised in homes with guns.

Despite great efforts in discovering more effective treatments for BD, it remains a difficult-to-treat condition with high morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it appears prudent to focus energies into developing interventions designed to prevent individuals from ever fully developing BD. Such interventions early in the development of the illness might prevent inappropriate interventions that may worsen or hasten development of BD, delay the onset of first manic episode, and/or prevent development of full BD. Studies of populations at high-risk for BD development have indicated that children with strong family histories of BD, who are themselves experiencing symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactive disorder (ADHD) and/or depression or have early mood dysregulation, may be experiencing prodromal states of BD. Understanding the neurobiological and genetic underpinnings that create risk for BD development would help with more accurate identification of this prodromal population, which could then lead to suitable preventative interventions. Such interventions could be pharmacologic or psychosocial in nature. Reductions in stress and increases in coping abilities through psychosocial interventions could decrease the chance of a future manic episode. Similarly, psychotropic medications may decrease negative sequelae of stress and have potential for neuroprotective and neurogenic effects that may contribute to prevention of fully expressed BD. Further research into the biologic and environmental mechanisms of BD development as well as controlled early intervention studies are needed to ameliorate this significant public health problem.

AB Objective: Despite the cost saving role of generic anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), debate exists as to whether generic substitution of branded AEDs may lead to therapeutic failure and increased toxicity. This study compared adverse event (AE) reporting rates for brand vs. authorized generic (AG) vs. generic AEDs. Since AGs are pharmaceutically identical to brand but perceived as generics, the generic vs. AG comparison minimized potential bias against generics.
   Methods: Events reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System between January 2004 to March 2015 with lamotrigine, carbamazepine, and oxcarbazepine listed as primary or secondary suspect were classified as brand, generic, or AG based on the manufacturer. Disproportionality analyses using the reporting odds ratio (ROR) assessed the relative rate of reporting of labeled AEs compared to reporting these events with all other drugs. The Breslow-Day statistic compared RORs across brand, AG, and other generics using a Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.01.
   Results: A total of 27,150 events with lamotrigine, 13,950 events with carbamazepine, and 5077 events with oxcarbazepine were reported, with generics accounting for 27%, 41%, and 32% of reports, respectively. Although RORs for the majority of known AEs were different between brand and generics for all three drugs of interest (Breslow-Day P < 0.001), RORs generally were similar for AG and generic comparisons. Generic lamotrigine and carbamazepine were more commonly involved in reports of suicide or suicidal ideation compared with the respective AGs based on a multiple comparison-adjusted P < 0.01.
   Significance: Similar AED reporting rates were observed for the AG and generic comparisons for most outcomes and drugs, suggesting that brands and generics have similar reporting rates after accounting for generic perception biases. Disproportional suicide reporting was observed for generics compared with AGs and brand, although this finding needs further study.

AB Introduction: Firearm injuries are a major health problem contributing to significant morbidity and mortality. Depression is associated with increased risk of adverse health outcomes in trauma patients and those hospitalized for serious disorders. We examined the relation between preexisting depression and adverse hospital outcomes and related injury severity among adult (> 16-years) firearm hospitalizations (FH).
   Methods: Using nationally representative Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2005 to 2011) and survey weighted multinomial logistic regression, we calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) to determine the risk of care facility discharge and in-hospital mortality by pre-existing depression.
   Results: Pre-existing depression was associated with a 3-fold risk of discharge to care facility (OR=2.91, 95% CI=2.57-3.30) and a 2-fold risk of in-hospital mortality (OR=2.05, 95%CI=1.69-2.47). ORs for risk of care facility discharge compared to routine discharge associated with depression among assault/legal-FH, unintentional-FH, suicide-FH and undetermined-FH was 2.73 (95%CI=2.23-3.33), 1.90 (95%CI =1.50-2.41), 1.52 (95% CI=126-1.83) and 242 (95%CI=1.60-3.67), while risk of inhospital mortality was 0.17 (95%CI=0.05-0.54), 0.60 (95%CI=0.28-1.29), 0.79 (95%CI=0.63-0.98) and 0.74 (95%CI =0.36-152).
   Limitations: Lack of information regarding re hospitalization due to the cross-sectional data. CONCLUSION: Persons with depression who were hospitalized due to firearm-related injury were less likely to survive than those without depression, and those discharged alive were at higher risk of discharge to a facility. Depression was associated with greater risk of discharge to facility among all intents, and lower risk of in hospital mortality among assault- and suicide-FH. These findings are important considering the increasing numbers of non-fatal firearm hospitalizations and the associated increase in healthcare expenditure. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB ObjectiveDespite the high prevalence of depression among vulnerable Hispanics with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), many do not disclose it or seek treatment. This study explored patient perceptions of depression, its association with their primary disease, barriers to disclosure, reasons for low utilization of mental health care resources, and culturally acceptable intervention approaches.
   MethodsSemistructured interviews were conducted with 46 participants with RA. Depression was evaluated using Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9).
   ResultsThirty-three percent of participants were moderately depressed at the time of the interview, based on PHQ-9 score 10; 12 of 46 patients (26%) stated they were depressed regardless of PHQ-9 score. Depression was perceived as a long-term, severe problem leading to suicide. It was associated with weakness and character flaws, contributing to stigma and reduced likelihood of disclosure. Antidepressants were not acceptable; self-reliance and interventions incorporating interpersonal connections were preferred. Systems-related barriers to disclosure included lack of verbal screening, language barriers, limited clinic visit time, and lack of continuity of care, restricting trust with providers.
   ConclusionRectifying misconceptions, as well as providing education regarding the association between RA and depression, the continuum of symptoms, and the range of experiences incurred are needed to facilitate earlier recognition and reduce stigma. Use, duration, and goals of antidepressant therapy should be clarified. Providers should strive to establish trust and conduct in-person depression screening to facilitate disclosure. Interventions with an interpersonal component, such as support groups or patient navigators, were preferred. Themes emphasizing coping strategies, stress reduction, positive thinking, self-efficacy, and resiliency are likely to be most acceptable.

AB BACKGROUND: Firearm-related fatalities are a top 3 cause of death among children in the United States. Despite historical declines in firearm ownership, the firearm-related mortality rate among young children has risen over the past decade. In this study, we examined changes in firearm ownership among families with young children from 1976 to 2016, exploring how such changes relate to recent increases in firearm-related mortality among 1- to 5-year-olds. METHODS: Individual-level data from the National Vital Statistics System were merged with household-level data from the General Social Survey to create national-level estimates of firearm-related child mortality and family firearm ownership from 1976 to 2016 (n = 41 years). Vector autoregression models were used to examine the association between firearm ownership and child mortality. RESULTS: The proportion of non-Hispanic white families with young children who owned firearms declined from 50% in 1976 to 45% in 2016 and from 38% to 6% among non-Hispanic African American families. The proportion of white families with young children who owned handguns, however, increased from 25% to 32%; 72% of firearm-owning families with young children now own a handgun. Increases in handgun ownership partially explained the recent rise in firearm-related white child mortality (B = 0.426), net of economic conditions, and sociodemographic characteristics of firearm-owning families. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in the types of firearms in the homes of US families may partially explain recently rising firearm-related mortality among young white children. These findings hold relevance for pediatricians and policy makers aiming to reduce firearm-related mortality and promote firearm safety in children's homes.

AB Background: Peer-led interventions have been applied to prevent various health behavior problems and may be an important complement to individual-level suicide prevention approaches. Sources of Strength trains student "peer leaders" in secondary schools to conduct prevention activities that encourage other students to build healthy social bonds and strengthen help-seeking norms. Prior work examining diffusion of peer-led programs has focused on youths' closeness to peer leaders but minimally on other factors such as connections to adults and suicidal behavior.
   Methods: We examined implementation and dissemination of Sources of Strength in 20 schools. Over 1 year 533 students were trained as peer leaders and 3,730 9th-12th graders completed baseline surveys assessing friendships and adults at school, and suicidal thoughts/behaviors; and end-of-year surveys reporting intervention exposure: viewed poster/video, attended presentation, direct peer communication, and activity participation. Chi-square tests compared exposure rates by student and network characteristics. Multi-level logistic regression models tested predictors of exposure across individual and school-level characteristics.
   Results: Exposure to the intervention varied greatly by school and by individual student characteristics and network position. Training more peer leaders increased school-wide exposure for all modalities except presentation (Bs 0.06-0.10, p's < 0.05). In multivariate models, exposure was consistently higher for students closer to peer leaders in the friendship network (ORs 1.13-1.54, p's < 0.05) and students who named more trusted adults (ORs 1.08-1.16, p's < 0.001); and lower for males (ORs 0.56-0.83, p's < 0.05). In multivariate models, training more students as peer leaders predicted exposure to poster-video and direct peer communication in larger schools (OR = 3.34 and 2.87, respectively). Network characteristics influenced exposure similarly for students with suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
   Discussion: Our findings confirm prior work showing the importance of personal affiliations to peer leaders and natural networks as a medium for diffusion of peer-led prevention efforts. We build on that work by showing independent effects of closeness to adults at school and number of peer leaders trained. There is a need to strategically select peer leaders to maximize closeness to students school-wide, particularly in larger schools. Additional work is required for Sources of Strength to devise messaging strategies to engage males and students isolated from adults at school.

ID RELIABILITY
AB Problem: Priority health-risk behaviors contribute to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among youth and adults. Population-based data on these behaviors at the national, state, and local levels can help monitor the effectiveness of public health interventions designed to protect and promote the health of youth nationwide.
   Reporting Period Covered: September 2012 December 2013.
   Description of the System: The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors six categories of priority health-risk behaviors among youth and young adults: 1) behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence; 2) tobacco use; 3) alcohol and other drug use; 4) sexual behaviors that contribute to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; 5) unhealthy dietary behaviors; and 6) physical inactivity. In addition, YRBSS monitors the prevalence of obesity and asthma. YRBSS includes a national school-based Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) conducted by CDC and state and large urban school district school-based YRBSs conducted by state and local education and health agencies. This report summarizes results for 104 health-risk behaviors plus obesity, overweight, and asthma from the 2013 national survey, 42 state surveys, and 21 large urban school district surveys conducted among students in grades 9-12.
   Results: Results from the 2013 national YRBS indicated that many high school students are engaged in priority health-risk behaviors associated with the leading causes of death among persons aged 10-24 years in the United States. During the 30 days before the survey, 41.4% of high school students nationwide among the 64.7% who drove a car or other vehicle during the 30 days before the survey had texted or e-mailed while driving, 34.9% had drunk alcohol, and 23.4% had used marijuana. During the 12 months before the survey, 14.8% had been electronically bullied, 19.6% had been bullied on school property, and 8.0% had attempted suicide. Many high school students nationwide are engaged in sexual risk behaviors that contribute to unintended pregnancies and STIs, including HIV infection. Nearly half (46.8%) of students had ever had sexual intercourse, 34.0% had had sexual intercourse during the 3 months before the survey (i.e., currently sexually active), and 15.0% had had sexual intercourse with four or more persons during their life. Among currently sexually active students, 59.1% had used a condom during their last sexual intercourse. Results from the 2013 national YRBS also indicate many high school students are engaged in behaviors associated with chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. During the 30 days before the survey, 15.7% of high school students had smoked cigarettes and 8.8% had used smokeless tobacco. During the 7 days before the survey, 5.0% of high school students had not eaten fruit or drunk 100% fruit juices and 6.6% had not eaten vegetables. More than one-third (41.3%) had played video or computer games or used a computer for something that was not school work for 3 or more hours per day on an average school day.
   Interpretation: Many high school students engage in behaviors that place them at risk for the leading causes of morbidity and mortality The prevalence of most health-risk behaviors varies by sex, race/ethnicity, and grade and across states and large urban school districts. Long term temporal changes also have occurred. Since the earliest year of data collection, the prevalence of most health-risk behaviors has decreased (e.g., physical fighting, current cigarette use, and current sexual activity), but the prevalence of other health-risk behaviors has not changed (e.g., suicide attempts treated by a doctor or nurse, having ever used marijuana, and having drunk alcohol or used drugs before last sexual intercourse) or has increased (e.g., having not gone to school because of safety concern and obesity and overweight).
   Public Health Action: YRBSS data are used widely to compare the prevalence of health-risk behaviors among. subpopulations of students; assess trends in health-risk behaviors over time; monitor progress toward achieving 20 national health objectives for Healthy People 2020 and one of the 26 leading health indicators; provide comparable state and large urban school district data; and help develop and evaluate school and community policies, programs, and practices designed to decrease health-risk behaviors and improve health outcomes among youth.

AB Objective: Meta-analyze all published epidemiologic studies reporting pediatric mania or bipolar disorder to investigate whether pediatric bipolar disorder is becoming more prevalent and whether rates vary significantly by country.
   Data Sources: Searches of PubMed and PsycInfo were conducted through the spring of 2010 using the following search terms: child, pediatric, young, adolescent, epidemiology, prevalence, bipolar, mania, suicide, and psychiatric. We also manually reviewed references in recent reviews of epidemiology of bipolar disorder.
   Study Selection: All studies reporting rates for mania or hypomania in community epidemiologic samples with participants up to 21 years of age.
   Data Extraction: All articles were coded to extract relevant variables. Prevalence rates were calculated from reported number of cases with bipolar disorders, then logit transformed. Twelve studies were included, enrolling 16,222 youths between the ages of 7 and 21 years during a period from 1985 to 2007. Six samples were from the United States; 6 were from other countries (the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Spain, Mexico, Ireland, and New Zealand).
   Results:The overall rate of bipolar disorder was 1.8% (95% CI, 1.1%-3.0%). There was no significant difference in the mean rates between US and non-US studies, but the US studies had a wider range of rates. The highest estimates came from studies that used broad definitions and included bipolar disorder not otherwise specified. Year of enrollment was negatively correlated with prevalence (r=-0.04) and remained nonsignificant when controlling for study methodological differences.
   Conclusions: Mean rates of bipolar disorder were higher than commonly acknowledged and not significantly different in US compared to non-US samples, nor was there evidence of an increase in rates of bipolar disorder in the community over time. Differences in diagnostic criteria were a main driver of different rates across studies. J Clin Psychiatry 2011;72(9):1250-1256 (C) Copyright 2011 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

AB In 1978 Italy implemented Law Number 180, the reform law that blocked all new admissions to public mental hospitals. After 40 years without mental hospitals, we aim at understanding the consequences of the Italian reform in terms of mental health care facility and staff availability. We compared the organization of the Italian mental health system with that of countries belonging to the Group of 7 (G7) major advanced economies. Italy has nearly 8 psychiatrists, 20 nurses, 2 social workers and less than 3 psychologists per 100,000 population, while for example in France there were 22 psychiatrists, in Japan 102 nurses, in the United States 18 social workers, and in Canada and France more than 45 psychologists per 100,000 population. In terms of inpatient facilities, no beds in mental hospitals were available in Italy, while in the other G7 countries mental hospital beds ranged from 8 in the United Kingdom to 204 in Japan per 100 000 population. In Italy there were fewer beds for acute care in general hospitals but more beds in community residential facilities than in the other G7 countries. Service use data showed variability in the provision of mental health care throughout the country. Soon after the implementation of the Italian reform the absolute number of compulsory admissions progressively declined, from more than 20,000 in 1978 to less than 9000 in 2015. Alongside the progressive decline of psychiatric beds imposed by Law 180, the age-adjusted suicide rate remained stable, ranging from 7.1/100,000 population in 1978 to 6.3/100,000 population in 2012. The population of psychiatric patients placed in Italian forensic psychiatric hospitals progressively declined. During the last 40 years without mental hospitals, Italy has seen a progressive consolidation of a community-based system of mental health care. We highlighted, however, reasons for concern, including a decreasing staffing level, a potential use of community residential facilities as long-stay residential services, a still too high variability in service provision across the country, and lack of national data on physical restraints. At a national level, the resources allocated to mental health care are lower in Italy than in other high-income countries.

AB Background and Aims Opioid-related overdose is increasingly linked to pregnancy-associated deaths, but factors associated with postpartum overdose are unknown. We aimed to estimate the strength of the association between maternal and infant characteristics and postpartum opioid-related overdose. Design Retrospective cohort study using a linked, population-level data set. Setting Massachusetts, United States. Conclusion Among women who delivered live infants in Massachusetts, USA between 2012 and 2014, maternal diagnosis of OUD, prior non-fatal overdose, infant diagnosis of NAS and high unscheduled health-care utilization appeared to be positively associated with postpartum opioid overdose. However, more than half of postpartum overdoses in that period were to women without a diagnosis of OUD. Engagement in methadone or buprenorphine treatment in the month prior to delivery was not sufficient to reduce the odds of postpartum overdose. Participants Women who delivered one or more live births from 2012 to 2014 (n = 174 517). Measurements The primary outcome was opioid-related overdose in the postpartum year. We used multivariable logistic regression to explore the independent associations of maternal (demographics, substance use, pregnancy) and infant [gestational age, birthweight, neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS)] characteristics with postpartum opioid overdose. Findings were stratified by maternal opioid use disorder (OUD) diagnosis. Findings There were 189 deliveries to women who experienced >= 1 opioid overdose in the first year postpartum (11 of 10 000 deliveries). Among women with postpartum opioid overdose, 46.6% had an OUD diagnosis within 12 months before delivery. In our adjusted model, maternal diagnosis of OUD [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 3.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.73-7.51] and prior non-fatal overdose (aOR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.11-5.17) were most strongly associated with postpartum overdose. After stratifying by OUD status, infant diagnosis of NAS (OUD+ aOR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.26-3.27; OUD- aOR = 2.79, 95% CI = 1.12-6.93) and high unscheduled health-care utilization (OUD+ aOR = 2.27, 95% CI = 1.38-3.73; OUD- aOR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.24-3.58) were positively associated with postpartum overdose in both groups.

AB Objectives: Mortality rates generally decline during economic recessions in high-income countries, however gaps remain in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms. This study estimates the impacts of increases in unemployment rates on both all-cause and cause-specific mortality across U.S. metropolitan regions during the Great Recession.
   Methods: We estimate the effects of economic conditions during the recent and severe recessionary period on mortality, including differences by age and gender subgroups, using fixed effects regression models. We identify a plausibly causal effect by isolating the impacts of within-metropolitan area changes in unemployment rates and controlling for common temporal trends. We aggregated vital statistics, population, and unemployment data at the area-month-year-age-gender-race level, yielding 527,040 observations across 366 metropolitan areas, 2005-2010.
   Results: We estimate that a one percentage point increase in the metropolitan area unemployment rate was associated with a decrease in all-cause mortality of 3.95 deaths per 100,000 person years (95%Ci 6.80 to 1.10), or 0.5%. Estimated reductions in cardiovascular disease mortality contributed 60% of the overall effect and were more pronounced among women. Motor vehicle accident mortality declined with unemployment increases, especially for men and those under age 65, as did legal intervention and homicide mortality, particularly for men and adults ages 25-64. We find suggestive evidence that increases in metropolitan area unemployment increased accidental drug poisoning deaths for both men and women ages 25-64.
   Conclusions: Our finding that all-cause mortality decreased during the Great Recession is consistent with previous studies. Some categories of cause-specific mortality, notably cardiovascular disease, also follow this pattern, and are more pronounced for certain gender and age groups. Our study also suggests that the recent recession contributed to the growth in deaths from overdoses of prescription drugs in working-age adults in metropolitan areas. Additional research investigating the mechanisms underlying the health consequences of macroeconomic conditions is warranted. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND Studies of fatalities from injury and disease guide prevention and treatment efforts for populations at risk. Findings can inform leadership and direct clinical practice guidelines, research, and personnel, training, and equipment requirements. METHODS A retrospective review and descriptive analysis was conducted of United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) fatalities who died while performing duties from September 11, 2001, to September 10, 2018. Characteristics analyzed included subcommand, military activity, operational posture, and manner of death. RESULTS Of 614 USSOCOM fatalities (median age, 30 years; male, 98.5%) the leading cause of death was injury (97.7%); specifically, multiple/blunt force injury (34.5%), blast injury (30.7%), gunshot wound (GSW; 30.3%), and other (4.5%). Most died outside the United States (87.1%), during combat operations (85.3%), in the prehospital environment (91.5%), and the same day of insult (90.4%). Most fatalities were with the US Army Special Operations Command (67.6%), followed by the Naval Special Warfare Command (16.0%), Air Force Special Operations Command (9.3%), and Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (7.2%). Of 54.6% who died of injuries incurred during mounted operations, most were on ground vehicles (53.7%), followed by rotary-wing (37.3%) and fixed-wing (9.0%) aircrafts. The manner of death was primarily homicide (66.0%) and accident (30.5%), followed by natural (2.1%), suicide (0.8%), and undetermined (0.7%). Specific homicide causes of death were GSW (43.7%), blast injury (42.2%), multiple/blunt force injury (13.8%), and other (0.2%). Specific accident causes of death were multiple/blunt force injury (80.7%), blast injury (6.4%), GSW (0.5%), and other (12.3%). Of accident fatalities with multiple/blunt force injury, the mechanism was mostly aircraft mishaps (62.9%), particularly rotary wing (68.4%). CONCLUSION Most USSOCOM fatalities died abroad from injury in the prehospital setting. To improve survival from military activities worldwide, leaders must continue to optimize prehospital capability and develop strategies that rapidly connect patients to advanced resuscitative and surgical care.

AB We conducted a systematic literature review on substance misuse, abuse, and dependence in women veterans, including National Guard/reserve members. We identified 837 articles published between 1980 and 2013. Of 56 included studies, 32 reported rates of alcohol misuse, binge drinking, or other unhealthy alcohol use not meeting diagnostic criteria for abuse or dependence, and 33 reported rates of drug misuse or diagnosed alcohol or drug use disorders. Rates ranged from 4% to 37% for alcohol misuse and from 7% to 25% for binge drinking; among Veterans Health Administration (VA) health-care system outpatients, rates ranged from 3% to 16% for substance use disorder. Studies comparing women veterans and civilians reported no clear differences in binge or heavy drinking. Substance misuse rates were generally lower among women veterans than men veterans. Substance misuse was associated with higher rates of trauma, psychiatric and medical conditions, and increased mortality and suicide rates. Most studies included only VA patients, and many used only VA medical record data; therefore, the reported substance misuse rates likely do not reflect true prevalence. Rates also varied by assessment method, source of data, and the subgroups studied. Further efforts to develop epidemiologically valid prevalence estimates are needed to capture the true health burden of substance misuse in women veterans, particularly those not using VA care.

ID FORENSIC TOXICOLOGY; POSTMORTEM; PREVALENCE; GENETICS; LITHIUM
AB BACKGROUND: One of the most difficult challenges in aviation medicine is to diagnose, as early as possible, pilots with psychiatric disorders that may impair pilot performance and increase the risk of incidents and accidents. This diagnosis applies particularly to bipolar disorder (BD), where return to flying duty is not an option in the majority of cases. BD is a long-term mental disorder presenting remittent depressive, hypomanic, manic, or mixed episodes between low symptomatic or asymptomatic intermediate periods. Onset in most cases is in late teen or early adult years. Suicidal intentions and suicide risk are significantly elevated in individuals with BD compared to the general population.
   METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed of BD and aviation accidents and the National Transportation Safety Board database of fatal general aviation accidents was searched. One case report and two database reports of interest from 1994 to 2014 were identified.
   RESULTS: The findings set a minimum frequency of BD in general aviation fatalities to be approximately 2 out of 8648 (0.023%) in the United States.
   DISCUSSION: The reported incidence may underestimate the real number of BD cases for several reasons, including the fact that the medical history of pilots is not always available or is sometimes not the primary interest of a safety investigation. This study suggests that the demarcation of psychiatric disorder related to fitness to fly is an important step in safety.

AB Migrant studies in the United States (US) have rarely covered the Middle Eastern population (ME), and have never distinguished the first and second generations born in the US. This study aims to describe the mortality patterns of ME immigrants by origin, acculturation, and generation. Death certificates issued from 1997 through 2004 were used to calculate, for Middle Eastern immigrants, the proportional odds ratios (POR) for major causes of death, with comparison to non-Hispanic Whites born in the US to US-born parents. First generation immigrants had higher odds for colorectal cancers, diabetes, and diseases of the heart, while their odds for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and suicide were lower. Men had higher odds for all cancers combined, cancers of the lymphatics, and pancreas. Women had lower odds for lung cancer, and dementia, and higher odds for breast cancer. The second generation men had higher odds for all cancers combined, and diseases of the heart, whereas women had lower odds for lung cancer and cerebrovascular accidents. Higher odds for colorectal cancers and lower odds for COPD were noted in both sexes. Some of the observed differences may be based on ethnic characteristics, including genetic makeup, early exposures, and culturally determined values. Time since immigration is associated with convergence of most odds to that of the native population.

AB Due to its fast economic growth and lifestyle changes, China is experiencing a rapid epidemiological transition from communicable to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Mental disorder such as depression is an important yet often neglected NCD and is becoming a growing cause of disability, suicides, and disease burden. This paper provides the first nationally representative estimate of the medical cost attributable to depression and depressive symptoms among the adult population in China. On the basis of the 2012 China Family Panel Studies survey, our results indicate that these mental health conditions have significant impacts on the individual medical expenditure, and they jointly contribute to 14.7% of total personal expected medical spending in China, with depression and depressive symptoms accounting for 6.9% and 7.8%, respectively. Given that patients with mental illness face multiple psychological and institutional barriers in seeking appropriate treatment, the high depression-induced medical costs may be primarily driven by the cost-shifting effect from mental health care to general health care, as mental disorders often coexist with other NCDs such as diabetes and hypertension. As an implication, our study calls for an urgent reform of China's mental health and insurance systems to remove the policy-induced obstacles for the access to mental health care resources.

TI Medical assistance in dying: Examining Canadian pharmacy perspectives
   using a mixed-methods approach
SO CANADIAN PHARMACISTS JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; EUTHANASIA; SUICIDE; ATTITUDES; DEATH
AB Background: Canada legalized assisted dying with the passing of Bill C-14, Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD), in June 2016. This legislation has implications for health care professionals participating in MAiD. This research aims to understand the effect that MAiD has on pharmacists and pharmacy technicians in Canada.
   Methods: We conducted a thematic document analysis of pharmacy guidelines, position statements and standards of practice from pharmacy regulatory authorities across Canada. In addition, the Ontario Pharmacists Association surveyed its members (including pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and pharmacy students) about their perceptions of MAiD.
   Results: Our thematic analysis of the reviewed documents resulted in 3 major themes: pharmacists' role in quality assurance, practice considerations when implementing MAiD and resources for pharmacy staff involved in MAiD. Survey responses illustrated that most (68%) pharmacy staff would dispense MAiD medications. Nonetheless, many respondents perceived that they lacked knowledge or comfort with different aspects of the MAiD process. Overall, 80% of participants reported a desire for professional development about MAiD.
   Conclusion: Despite the rapidly changing landscape surrounding medical assistance in dying within the past year, most pharmacy regulatory authorities have provided direction and resources to their pharmacists. Ontario pharmacists and pharmacy technicians are willing to dispense MAiD medications; however, additional support in the form of professional development may be necessary based on participants' desire for education coupled with their perceived lack of knowledge. Future research may focus on the efficacy of provincial guidelines in supporting pharmacists' participation in MAiD.

SO ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS
LA English
DT Review
DE biopower; governmentality; terrorism; topology; torture
ID TERRITORIALITY; SPACE; GOVERNMENTALITY; SOVEREIGNTY
AB Torture can be understood as part of a geopolitical response to a discursively inflated threat. Public discussions of torture in the United States between 11 September 2001 and the May 2004 revelations of abuses at Abu Ghraib prison cautiously justified brutal interrogation methods by couching the threat of terrorism in the language of the ticking-bomb scenario. Terrorist acts constitute a real threat to material security, specifically to the "topological'' presuppositions of the forms of power/knowledge that Foucault and others have argued are central to modern social orders. Techniques of biopower and governmentality can only operate effectively if "normally empowered'' biopolitical subjects allow populations and governing authorities to orient their governing and self-governing activities according to "mappable landscapes of expectation.'' The threat of terrorism, especially in the person of the suicide bomber, renders landscapes of expectation more difficult to map, at least locally. The ticking-bomb scenario is the most important vehicle by which the material threat of terrorism has been discursively extended to encompass the entire national territory and intensified to a uniform level of unacceptability. Once this process is recognized, it is possible both to understand torture as a biopolitical technique of compensation for the threat of terrorism in its discursively inflated form and to place torture more firmly within the wider geopolitical account of "Empire'' inaugurated by Agamben, Butler, and Hardt and Negri.

ID ADOLESCENT CANCER; LATE DEATHS
AB Survivors of childhood and adolescent cancer are at risk for long-term effects of disease and treatment. The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study assessed overall and cause-specific mortality in a retrospective cohort of 20,690 5-year survivors. Eligible Subjects were individuals diagnosed with cancer (from 1970 to 1986) before the age of 21 who had survived 5 years from diagnosis. Underlying cause of death was obtained from death certificates and other sources, then and coded and categorized as recurrent disease, sequel of cancer treatment, or non-cancer-related. Age and sex standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated using United States Population mortality data. The cohort demonstrated an 8.2-fold excess in overall mortality (95% confidence interval, 7.9 to 8.5). Recurrence of the original cancer was the leading cause of death among 5-year survivors, accounting for 57% of deaths. Statistically significant excess mortality rates were seen due to Subsequent malignancies (SMR = 15.0), along with cardiac (SMR = 6.9), and pulmonary (SMR = 8.7). There was no increase seen for automotive accidents (SMR = 1.0), other accidents (SMR = 1.3), or suicide (SMR = 1.0). While recurrent disease remains a major contributor to late mortality in 5-year survivors of childhood cancer, significant excesses in mortality risk associated with treatment-related complications exist up to 25 years after the initial cancer diagnosis.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients' religious commitments and religious communities are known to influence their experiences of illness and their medical decisions. Physicians are also dynamic partners in the doctor patient relationship, yet little is known about the religious characteristics of physicians or how physicians' religious commitments shape the clinical encounter.
   OBJECTIVE: To provide a baseline description of physicians' religious characteristics, and to compare physicians' characteristics with those of the general U. S. population.
   DESIGN/PARTICIPANTS: Mailed survey of a stratified random sample of 2,000 practicing U. S. physicians. Comparable U. S. population data are derived from the 1998 General Social Survey.
   MEASUREMENTS/ RESULTS: The response rate was 63%. Fifty- five percent of physicians say their religious beliefs influence their practice of medicine. Compared with the general population, physicians are more likely to be affiliated with religions that are underrepresented in the United States, less likely to say they try to carry their religious beliefs over into all other dealings in life (58% vs 73%), twice as likely to consider themselves spiritual but not religious (20% vs 9%), and twice as likely to cope with major problems in life without relying on God (61% vs 29%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Physicians' religious characteristics are diverse and they differ in many ways from those of the general population. Researchers, medical educators, and policy makers should further examine the ways in which physicians' religious commitments shape their clinical engagements.

AB The increased life expectancy among HIV-infected persons treated with combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), risk behaviors, and co-morbidities associated with ART place HIV-infected persons at risk for non-HIV-related causes of death. We used the San Francisco HIV/AIDS registry to identify deaths that occurred from January 1996 through December 2011. Temporal trends in AIDS- and non-AIDS-related mortality rates, the proportion of underlying and contributory causes of death, and the ratio of observed deaths in the study population to expected number of deaths among California men aged 20-79 (standardized mortality ratio [SMR]) of underlying causes of death were examined. A total of 5338 deaths were identified. The annual AIDS-related death rate (per 100 deaths) declined from 10.8 in 1996 to 0.9 in 2011 (p<0.0001), while the annual death rate from non-AIDS-related causes declined from 2.1 in 1996 to 0.9 in 2011 (p<0.0001). The proportion of deaths due to all types of heart disease combined, all non-AIDS cancers combined, mental disorders resulting from substance abuse, drug overdose, suicide and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease increased significantly over time. The SMRs for liver diseased decreased significantly over time but remained elevated. Our data highlight the importance of age-related causes of death as well as deaths from causes that are, at least in part, preventable.

AB An Internet survey revealed that day-of-the-week (DOW) stereotypes (i.e., Monday blues, Wednesday hump day, "TGIF", etc.) were pronounced when subjects predicted their moods for each day of the upcoming week, less obvious when they remembered their moods from each day of the preceding week, and least apparent in the momentary moods they actually experienced on each day. In a second study involving 2-hour, in-home interviews, subjects reporting looking forward to weekends because of the lack of structure and discipline and the freedom to choose activities, yet much of their weekend time was spent fulfilling a need to be productive, which often involved activities that, in many ways, simulated paid work. The content of these interviews suggested that people tend to overvalue future discretionary time on the weekend, assuming that two days of uninterrupted idle time will be more enjoyable than it actually is. In a more general sense, these results suggest that the predicted and remembered moods in the initial survey were driven by DOW stereotypes, which facilitated rapid judgements given the simple scaled response format. However, the depth interviews revealed that moods experienced throughout the week are more nuanced in terms of how they are remembered, described, and linked to recently passed, current, and immediately anticipated events, perhaps explaining why DOW stereotypes were less obvious in the reported momentary moods.

AB Introduction/Objective Sudden death in children may occur as a result of many diseases and accidents, while the cause often remains unknown. There are different terms in the literature that represent the causes of sudden death in children. The aim of our study was to determine the most common cause of sudden death in children admitted to the Clinic of Pediatrics.
   Methods The retrospective study was conducted in the period from January 1, 1995 to December 31, 2015 and included 49 patients, aged from 10 days to 17 years, in whom death occurred in the Emergency Department and in the first 48 hours of hospitalization.
   Results In 23 patients (47%) the cause of death was infection, in 10 patients (20%) heart failure, four patients (8%) died due to status epilepticus, the same number of patients (8%) died due to aspiration of a foreign body, while the rest of the patients died due to diabetic ketoacidosis (2%), rickets (2%), carbon monoxide poisoning (2%), hemolytic anemia (2%), suicide by hanging (2%), drowning (2%), sudden infant death syndrome (2%), and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (2%). Most of the patients in our study were infants (43%).
   Conclusion Our study shows that infants are at the highest risk of sudden death, while the most frequent causes of death are infections and cardiovascular diseases.

AB To assess the impact of stress and workload on sexual health and quality of life (QOL) of the medical residents in training.
   A total of 339 male and female medical residents from 11 specialties were surveyed. Level of stress, sexual health and QOL were measured using validated questionnaires.
   Overall, 49% of the female and 11% of male residents had sexual dysfunction, and 47% and 34% respectively indicated being very to mostly dissatisfied with their sexual life. Both the frequency of sexual activity and quality of relationship with partner decreased during residency compared with the time immediately prior to residency. This decline was irrespective of gender, specialty or year of residency. A majority of residents (75% of women and 54% of men) were identified to be at high levels of stress using a validated questionnaire. In women, stress negatively influenced most domains of sexual health including desire, arousal and satisfaction; in men, satisfaction was significantly affected by high levels of stress. Long hours of work (> 70 h per week) impacted sexual health less profoundly than did stress. Among both male and female residents, QOL was significantly lower among residents who experienced sexual dysfunction and dissatisfaction compared with those with normal sexual functioning.
   Our results highlight the importance of stress-management efforts in residency programmes and provide evidence that limiting work hours alone may not lead to significant improvement in sexual health and QOL during residency.

AB Background. The authors review the clinical features, epidemiology, pathophysiology, medical management, dental findings and dental management of patients who have bipolar I disorder, or BD, previously known as manic-depressive disorder.
   Types of Studies Reviewed. The authors conducted a MEDLINE search for the period 1995 through 2001 using the key terms "bipolar disorder," "epidemiology," " pathophysiology," "treatment" and "dentistry." The articles they selected for further review included those published in English in peer-reviewed journals; they gave preference to articles reporting randomized, controlled trials.
   Results. BD is a psychiatric illness characterized by extreme mood swings. Mania is accompanied by euphoria, grandiosity, racing thoughts and lack of insight. Depression is characterized by marked sadness or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities. The unpredictable mood swings can distress the person, can impair social function and quality of life and are associated with a significant increase in the risk for substance abuse and suicide. BD is common in the United States, with a lifetime prevalence rate of 1.6 percent and recurrence rate of more than 50 percent.
   Clinical Implications. The prevalence of dental disease usually is extensive because of poor oral hygiene and medication-induced xerostomia. Preventive dental education, saliva substitutes and anticaries agents are indicated. To avoid adverse drug interactions with the usually prescribed psychiatric medications, special precautions should be taken when administering certain antibiotics, analgesics and sedatives.

AB As the threat of public mass shootings continues to be on the forefront of Americans' minds, it begs the question whether there are differences between young and older mass shooters. In general, earlier research suggests that young people are more likely than their older counterparts to commit crimes because of immaturity, lack of impulse control, rebelliousness, peer pressure, poor role models, and the influence of what they see on television or consume through other media content. When it comes to mass shooters, however, the answer to this question may depend on whether "young" offenders are defined using the legal age of adulthood or the scientific definition of when brain development typically reaches maturity. This study aims to determine whether significant differences exist between public mass shooters who were younger than or older than 18 years when they attacked, or younger than or older than 25 years when they attacked, by examining 88 offenders who struck in the United States from January 1982 to March 2018. Tests of statistical significance suggest that with both definitions, young mass shooters are more likely than older mass shooters to obtain their weapons illegally, attack at schools, have a reported history of animal abuse, and admit copying or being inspired by previous attackers. These results are interpreted in the context of previous scholarship, and recommendations are provided for future research.

AB This study assesses the percentage of traumatic fatalities attributable to work-related causes in the US, by cause of death and population demographics. The 1993-1998 Vital Statistics Mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics were used. There were 848,945 traumatic fatalities (E800-E999) among the general population 16 years or older in the US during this time; of these, 32,044 were work-related accounting for 3.8% of all the fatalities. The work-related percentage varied from 62.7% for machine-related deaths to 0.7% for suicides, from 4.9% for males to 1.0% for females, from 9.8% in Alaska to 1.5% in Arizona, from 4.2% for decedents with 1 to 4 year college educations to 2.9% for decedents with high school or less, from 4.4% for races other than white and black to 2.6% for black. Mean age-at-death was 42 years for work-related vs. 48 years for non-work-related fatalities. This difference is more pronounced for deaths from falls (45 years vs. 78 years). Conversely, victims of work-related homicide were older than non-work-related (41 years vs. 33 years). A more complete understanding of the burden of traumatic fatalities attributable to work-related causes requires consideration of the total work-related percentage, causes of death, and population demographics.

AB OBJECTIVES: To assess how care is delivered for mental disorders using videotapes of office visits involving elderly patients.
   DESIGN: Mixed-method observational analysis of the nature of the topics discussed, content of discussion, and the time spent on mental health.
   SETTINGS: Three types of settings: an academic medical center, a managed care group, and fee-for-service solo practitioners.
   PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-five primary care physicians and 366 of their elderly patients.
   MEASUREMENTS: Videotapes of 385 visits covering 2,472 diverse topics were analyzed. Coding of the videotapes identified topics, determined talk time, and coded the dynamics of talk.
   RESULTS: Mental health topics occurred in 22% of visits, although patient survey indicated that 50% of the patients were depressed. A typical mental health discussion lasted approximately 2 minutes. Qualitative analysis suggested wide variations in physician effort in providing mental health care. Referrals to mental health specialists were rare even for severely depressed and suicidal patients.
   CONCLUSION: Little time is spent on mental health care for elderly patients despite heavy disease burdens. Standards of care based on a count of visits "during which a mental health problem is discussed" may need to be supplemented with guidelines about what should happen during the visit. System-level interventions are needed.

AB Objective: Prescription opioid related abuse, suicide and death are significant public health problems. This study compares rates of poison center calls categorized as intentional abuse, suspected suicidal intent or fatality for the 7-day buprenorphine transdermal system/patch (BTDS) with other extended-release and long-acting (ER/LA) opioids indicated for chronic pain.
   Methods: Retrospective 24-month cohort study using National Poison Data System data from July 2012 through June 2014. BTDS was introduced in the United States in January 2011. Numbers and rates of calls of intentional abuse, suspected suicidal intent and fatalities were evaluated for BTDS, ER morphine, ER oxycodone, fentanyl patch, ER oxymorphone and methadone tablets/capsules, using prescription adjustment to account for community availability. Rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.
   Results: Absolute numbers and prescription-adjusted rates of intentional abuse and suspected suicidal intent with BTDS were significantly lower (p < .0001) than for all other ER/LA opioid analgesics examined. No fatalities associated with BTDS exposure were reported.
   Conclusion: This post-marketing evaluation of BTDS indicates infrequent poison center calls for intentional abuse and suspected suicidal intent events, suggesting lower rates of these risks with BTDS compared to other ER/LA opioids.

AB Background: Obesity is associated with depression, but a common measure of obesity, body mass index (BMI), combines height and weight. Consequently, which body shape dimensions and sizes are most relevant to depression is unclear.
   Method: Data were analyzed from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey years 2007-2016, focusing on adults age 20 and older who were not pregnant. In this nationally-representative sample (N = 23,739), relations of depressive symptoms with body shape variables were tested, controlling for age, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.
   Results: Body weight and BMI, but not standing height, predicted depressive symptoms. Adults with relatively high body weight or BMI (roughly the top 30-40% of women or 10% of men) had substantively elevated depressive symptoms (d >= 0.20) within genders. BMI ranges predicting elevated depressive symptoms among women (BMI >= 30) and men (BMI >= 36) were higher than standard overweight and obesity definitions, respectively.
   Limitations: This observational study was cross-sectional. Future longitudinal and experimental research is needed to clarify potential causal relations between body weight and depression. Other body shape variables may also predict depression.
   Conclusions: Body weight but not height predicted concurrent risk for depressive symptomatology in the United States. Future research should test whether assessment focused on body weight not adjusted for height, as in BMI, improves depression prevention and treatment.

AB Objective: This paper aims to quantify the population-level associations between child injury deaths and adult (aged 15 + years) per capita alcohol consumption (PCC) and between child injury deaths and the impact of major alcohol and safety policy changes in Australia.
   Methods: All child deaths due to external causes during 1910-2013, and child deaths due specifically to road crashes, assaults, suicide and other external causes, were obtained from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. Child (0-14 year) mortality rates were analysed in relation to PCC using an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model.
   Results: A positive association between PCC and overall child external mortality was identified. The estimated coefficient was 0.326 (p =.002), indicating that a 10% decrease in PCC was associated with a 3.3% reduction in child injury mortality. A positive association was identified for road traffic and other child injury mortality, but not assault injuries. The introduction of compulsory seatbelt legislation in combination with random breath testing was associated with a reduction in overall injury and road traffic child mortality. Decreasing the legal drinking age was associated with an increase in the rate of other external-cause child mortality.
   Conclusion: Reducing PCC in Australia is likely to result in a small but significant reduction in the injury mortality rate of children aged 0-14 years.

AB Sweden's compulsory addiction system treats individuals with severe alcohol and narcotics use disorders. Merging data from three national level register databases of those sentenced to compulsory care from 2001 to 2009 (n = 4515), the aims of this study were to: (1) compute mortality rates to compare to the general Swedish population; (2) identify leading cause of mortality by alcohol or narcotics use; and (3) identify individual level characteristics associated with mortality among alcohol and narcotics users. In this population, 24% were deceased by 2011. The most common cause of death for alcohol users was physical ailments linked to alcohol use, while narcotics users commonly died of drug poisoning or suicide. Average age of death differed significantly between alcohol users (55.0) and narcotics users (32.5). Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified the same three factors predicting mortality: older age (alcohol users OR = 1.28, narcotic users OR = 1.16), gender [males were nearly 3 times more likely to die among narcotics users (p < .000) acid 1.6 times more likely to die among alcohol users (p < .01)] and reporting serious health problems (for alcohol users p < .000, for narcotics users p < .05). Enhanced program and government efforts are needed to implement overdose-prevention efforts and different treatment modalities for both narcotic and alcohol users. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Purpose: The current study describes how the excess mortality risk associated with depression translates into specific causes of death occurring during a 40-year follow-up period, with focus on deaths related to injuries, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer.
   Methods: Data come from a cross-sectional survey (Community Mental Health Epidemiology Study) conducted in the early 1970s in Washington County, Maryland. Random sampling for the survey resulted in 2762 interviews. For the current analyses, baseline depressed mood was linked to current participant vital status through the use of death certificates.
   Results: The relative subdistribution hazards for cardiovascular deaths (3.08 [1.74-5.45]) and fatal injuries (4.63 [1.76-12.18]) were significant during the entire 40-year period for young adults (18-39 years old at baseline). The relative subdistribution hazard for cardiovascular deaths during the first 15 years of follow-up was pronounced in elderly (>= 65 years) males (2.99 [1.67-5.37]) subjects. There were no significant associations between depressed mood and cancer deaths.
   Conclusions: Individuals in the general community with depressed mood may be at increased risk of deaths as the result of cardiovascular disease and injury, even several decades after exposure assessment. Young adults with depressed mood appear to be particularly vulnerable to these associations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Adolescent health-risk behaviors can have long lasting negative effects throughout an individual's life, and cause a major economic and social burden to society. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of the health-risk behaviors among Chinese adolescents and to test the trends in health-risk behaviors without and with adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. Data were drawn from the School-based Chinese Adolescents Health Survey, which is an ongoing school-based study about the health-risk behaviors among Chinese adolescents (7th to 12th grade). During the first wave through the third wave, the prevalence of lifetime, past 12-month, and past 30-day use of opioid decreased by 4.19%, 0.63%, and 0.56%, respectively. Moreover, the prevalence of lifetime, past 12-month, and past 30-day sedative use decreased by 3.03%, 0.65%, and 0.35%, respectively. During the three waves, most trends in the prevalence of health-risk behaviors were downward, with a few exceptions: The prevalence of lifetime smoking, drinking, methamphetamine use, and sleep disturbance increased by 7.15%, 13.08%, 0.48%, and 9.06%, respectively. The prevalence of lifetime 3,4-methylene dioxy methamphetamine use (from 0.49% to 0.48%), lifetime mephedrone use (from 0.30% to 0.24%), or suicide attempts (from 2.41% to 2.46%) remained stable.

SO CRIME MEDIA CULTURE
LA English
DT Article
DE fear of crime; gated communities; homicide; segregation; social
   inequality
ID COMMUNITY; SUICIDE
AB The move to gated communities has been linked to both rising affluence and anxiety. These attempts to withdraw from the perceived dangers of urban areas are also predicated on the pursuit of a neighbourhood ideal, and freedom from danger is usually central to this ideal. This paper critically reconsiders these propositions by examining news reports and media narratives surrounding the nature of homicidal violence occurring within such developments. We have analysed fifty news reports from the last decade that address murder committed inside gated communities. In our analysis of these reports we suggest that attempts to neutralise danger in high crime societies are by no means guaranteed-even via the most strenuous efforts at deploying walls, gates and guards. Building on the arguments of Low (2003) and Zedner (2003), we suggest that demands for security are not only unending but that an outward-facing orientation that positions risk outside gated neighbourhoods is a denial of the continued danger of intimate and other forms of violence within communities and households behind gates. In this context the move to enclosure is more than a pragmatic attempt to defend against threat; it appears to reflect the impotence of efforts associated with addressing deep ontological insecurities. Studies continue to record high levels of fear in gated developments, and highly gendered risks of violence continue to be a part of the social reality of the segregated neighbourhood.

AB Nurses, as the largest group of health providers in the United States, and by virtue of their scope of practice, are in an important position to promote the health of adolescents. A national survey of nurse members of the American Public Health Association, the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Associates and Practitioners, and the National Association of School Nurses was conducted in 1997 (n = 520) and was compared with findings from a parallel survey conducted in 1985 that assessed perceived competence in addressing common adolescent health issues, relevance of those issues to nurses' practice, and leadership skills. Findings provided a hopeful yet cautious picture of nurses' competencies. Strong increases in the proportion of nurses who felt equipped to address common health problems of youth suggest improved adolescent health education among nurses. Yet, at least 25% of nurses indicated a low level of knowledge in half of the adolescent health areas, and, like 1985's nurses, most nurses in 1997 did not feel competent to address the needs of gay, lesbian, and bisexual youth. Several priority areas in Healthy People 2010 were considered by 25% or more of the nurses to be irrelevant to their practice, including smoking cessation, suicide, violence, and pregnancy. The task remains to assure that all nurses who work with adolescents are equipped to respond to their diverse and unique health needs.

AB Religion provides an important basis for social integration and the prevention of deviant behavior, such as tax fraud, a crime that costs society billions of dollars in lost revenue. The literature on tax fraud and tax fraud acceptability (TFA) has neglected religiosity as a social bond that may deter this type of behavior Furthermore, existing work is based on the United States; there are no systematic cross-national studies. In particular, there is no research exploring the "moral communities" hypothesis that religiosity's effect on deviance will vary according to the strength of national moral communities. The present study addresses these two gaps in the literature by analyzing data on 45,728 individuals in 36 nations from the World Values Surveys. We control for other predictors of TFA, including social bonds, economic strain, and demographic factors. The results determined that the higher the individual's level of religiosity, the lower the TFA. Results on the moral community's hypothesis were mixed However, in a separate analysis of individual nations, the presence of a "moral community" (majority of the population identifies with a religious group) explained 39 percent of the variation in the presence or absence of the expected religiosity-TFA relationship. Furthermore, the presence of a communist regime in a nation, often known for the oppression of religious groups who then may view the regime as illegitimate, diminished the impact of religion on TFA.

AB Background: Little is known about the prevalence of bipolar disorder in the general population, what proportion is receiving care and what factors motivate people to seek help. Method: Data were derived from The Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS), a psychiatric epidemiological study in the general population in The Netherlands. DSM-III-R diagnoses were based on the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Results: Lifetime prevalence of bipolar disorder was 1.9%. Compared to other mental disorders, people with bipolar disorder were more often incapacitated were more likely to have attempted suicide and reported a poorer quality of life 82.8% had experienced an additional mental disorder in their lifetime; 25.5% had never sought help for their emotional problems, not even primary, informal or alternative care. Limitations: Three limitations of the study are: (1) the CIDI prevalence estimates for bipolar disorder may be inflated; (2) personality disorders were not recorded in the NEMESIS dataset; (3) in NEMESIS certain groups have not been reached, Conclusion: Three-quarters of the bipolar respondents do not benefit sufficiently from the treatment methods now available. In view of the serious consequences of this condition, greater efforts are needed to reach people with bipolar disorder, to get them into treatment. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) populations, including those who do not identify with gender binary constructs (man or woman) are increasingly recognized in health care settings. Research on the health of TGNC people is growing, and disparities are often noted. In this review, we examine 77 studies published between January 1, 1997 and March 22, 2017 which reported mental health outcomes in TGNC populations to (a) characterize what is known about mental health outcomes and (b) describe what gaps persist in this literature. In general, depressive symptoms, suicidality, interpersonal trauma exposure, substance use disorders, anxiety, and general distress have been consistently elevated among TGNC adults. We also used the minority stress model as a framework for summarizing existing literature. While no studies included all elements of the Minority Stress Model, this summary gives an overview of which studies have looked at each element. Findings suggest that TGNC people are exposed to a variety of social stressors, including stigma, discrimination, and bias events that contribute to mental health problems. Social support, community connectedness, and effective coping strategies appear beneficial. We argue that routine collection of gender identity data could advance our understanding mental health risk and resilience factors among TGNC populations.

AB Objectives. We investigated associations between stress and mental health (positive affect, depressive symptoms) among HIV-negative and HIV-positive midlife and older gay-identified men, along with the mediating and moderating effects of mastery and emotional support. We also studied the mental health effects of same-sex marriage.
   Methods. We obtained data from self-administered questionnaires completed in 2009 or 2010 by a subsample (n=202; average age = 56.91 years; age range = 44-75 years) of participants in the University of California, Los Angeles component of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, one of the largest and longest-running natural-history studies of HIV/AIDS in the United States.
   Results. Both sexual minority stress (perceived gay-related stigma, excessive HIV bereavements) and aging-related stress (independence and fiscal concerns) appeared to have been detrimental to mental health. Sense of mastery partially mediated these associations. Being legally married was significantly protective net of all covariates, including having a domestic partner but not being married. Education, HIV status, and race/ethnicity had no significant effects.
   Conclusions. Sexual minority and aging-related stress significantly affected the emotional lives of these men. Personal sense of mastery may help to sustain them as they age. We observed specific mental health benefits of same-sex legal marriage. (Am J Public Health. 2012;102:503-510. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2011.300384)

AB Most people spend the majority of their lives indoors. Research over the last thirty years has focused on investigating the mechanisms through which specific elements of the built environment, such as indoor air quality, influence the physical health of occupants. However, similar effort has not been expended in regard to mental health, a significant public health concern. One in five Americans has been diagnosed with a mental health disorder in the past year, and, in the United States, the number of suicide deaths are similar to the number of deaths due to breast cancer. Increases in mental health disorders in Western societies may be due, in part, to increased systemic inflammation, secondary to decreased exposures to a diverse microbial environment (i.e., the hygiene hypothesis, "Old Friends" hypothesis, "missing microbes" hypothesis, or biodiversity hypothesis), as well as increased environmental exposures that lead to chronic low-grade inflammation. In this review, we provide an assessment that integrates historical research across disciplines. We offer ten questions that highlight the importance of current lessons learned regarding the built environment and mental health, including a potential role for the microbiome of the built environment to influence mental health. Suggested areas for future investigation are also highlighted.

ID HUMANE EUTHANASIA; SUICIDE; STRESS; ILLNESS; BURNOUT; JOB
AB Population management euthanasia, or culling, is a recognized tool for managing animal populations in human care. Previous research in zoos has shown that animal care staff attitudes about culling vary based on gender, job type, awareness of culling, the taxon in question for culling, and situational factors, but the attitudes of zoo veterinarians have not been studied previously, despite the fact that they are often tasked with carrying out euthanasia. We surveyed a sample of currently employed, zoo-based veterinarians in the United States on their knowledge and attitudes about population management euthanasia. Veterinarians demonstrated a high knowledge and awareness of population management euthanasia and were as supportive, if not more supportive, of it than previously surveyed groups. Similar to previous studies, attitudes about culling varied with the type of animal being considered for euthanasia. Female veterinarians and those veterinarians not aware of population management euthanasia events at their facilities were less supportive of the practice, again in agreement with previous studies of other zoo professionals. Veterinarians tended to be either more population-focused or individual-focused in their thinking about culling for population management compared to other zoo personnel, who often rated themselves as considering the needs of populations and individuals more equally. Our results suggest that veterinarians are important stakeholders in discussions about population management euthanasia in zoos and are likely to be supportive when information on rationale is presented.

AB Men who have sex with men (MSM) exhibit elevated rates of mental health and substance use disorder relative to their non-MSM male counterparts. Methamphetamine use in particular has been associated with both neuronal damage and mental health disorders among MSM, and this study reports on the prevalence and comorbidity of DSM-5 mental health and substance use disorders in a sample of methamphetamine-using MSM. From March 2014 through January 2015, 286 methamphetamine-using MSM enrolled in a study to reduce methamphetamine use and sexual risk behaviors. At baseline, participants demonstrated high rates of current major depressive episode (35.8%), antisocial personality disorder (23.9%), suicide risk (23.2%), obsessive-compulsive disorder (23.2%), and social phobia (20.4%), as well as methamphetamine use disorder (89.1%), marijuana use disorder (41.0%), alcohol use disorder (39.6%), cocaine use disorder (30.9%), and inhalants use disorder (15.4%). Analyses revealed significant (p<0.05) associations between methamphetamine use disorder severity and all listed mental health disorders, as well as between alcohol use disorder and all listed mental health disorders. Mental health disorder prevalence and substance use disorder severity were both elevated, and both methamphetamine and alcohol use disorder severity were associated with increased likelihood of comorbid mental health disorder.

TI Therapeutic Hypothermia for Brain Injury from Near Hanging: Review of
   the Literature
SO THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA AND TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Review
ID CARDIAC-ARREST; COMATOSE SURVIVORS; RESUSCITATION; GUIDELINES
AB Hanging, strangulation, and suffocation constitute the second most common cause of death by suicide in the United States after firearms. Near hanging is defined as an unsuccessful attempt at hanging. Victims of near hanging suffer from strangulation with cerebral ischemia and resultant reperfusion injury, irrespective of whether they had cardiac arrest or not. The acute post-injury period is characterized by several pathophysiologic processes that start in the minutes to hours following injury. All of these processes are temperature dependent; they are all aggravated by fever and inhibited by hypothermia. In this article, we review the current clinical evidence on the use of therapeutic hypothermia (TH) for comatose near-hanging patients. We identified seven studies involving TH for near hanging on 51 patients. All the studies are retrospective reviews or case reports. TH (32-33 degrees C) was applied for 24-36 hours. Even though some studies showed that near-hanging victims who present comatose to the hospital can have good neurologic outcomes after supportive therapy alone, some patients are still left with a poor neurologic outcome, especially if they sustained cardiac arrest. Prospective studies are warranted to test the potential benefit of TH on neurologic outcome and survival in this patient population. Although it would be difficult to conduct such studies, we feel that the compelling case studies, anecdotal evidence, and extrapolated data support its use until more evidence can be obtained.

AB Objective: To determine whether the chronically or recurrently depressed patients of family practice and internal medicine physicians differed in the proportion reporting that their primary care physician asked them about depression symptoms.
   Design: A cross-sectional observational study of chronically or recurrently depressed survey respondents who identified a family practice or internal medicine physician as their primary care provider.
   Setting: A large not-for-profit group-model health maintenance organization in the northwestern United States, with a population representative of its service area.
   Patients: Health maintenance organization members (n = 1161) with ongoing or recurring depression or dysthymia who responded to a 1993 survey and who identified either a family practice or internal medicine physician as their primary care provider.
   Main Outcome Measure: Patients' self-report of their primary care physician asking them: (1) whether they had been feeling, sad, blue, or depressed; (2) to fill out a questionnaire about their mood or feelings; and (3) whether they had been thinking about death or suicide.
   Results: Chronically or recurrently depressed patients of family practice physicians were more likely to report that their physician asked them about depressive symptoms than were patients of internal medicine physicians (34.0% vs 27.3%) (P = .02). This finding persisted in a multivariate analysis.
   Conclusion: Family practice physicians may be more attentive to depressive disorders than internal medicine physicians.

AB Introduction. Few data exist to estimate the burden of manic episodes on healthcare systems or the therapeutic strategies used. This study was undertaken to identify treatment strategies chosen, and to assess the "real-world" direct medical cost of treating manic episodes necessitating hospitalisation. Method. Case record data were reviewed during the three months following hospitalisation for a manic episode in France. Healthcare resource utilisation was assessed, direct costs calculated, and treatment strategies analysed. A total of 137 patients files (51.8% female; mean age: 35 years) were reviewed and data on 185 hospitalisations collected. Results. The mean duration of hospitalisation was 47 days over the study period. The most common treatment strategy during hospitalisation was the combination of a mood stabiliser with a neuroleptic drug (64% of patients at day 30). Anticonvulsants including valproate (39%) and carbamazepine (20%) were more common than lithium (42%). Treatment received during hospitalisation was generally continued after discharge, with a trend away from neuroleptics and towards mood stabilisers. The mean direct costs incurred over the three-month study period was Euro 22 297, with 98.6% of those costs due to hospitalisation. Conclusion. These results confirm that the costs of treating a manic episode are high, and overwhelmingly due to the cost of hospitalisation. (C) 2002 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

AB Background: The aim of this study was to examine factors associated with the use of mental health consultation for depressive symptoms.
   Methods: We used data from the 2013 Community Health Survey, which included responses from 13,269 individuals who reported that they had experienced depressive symptoms for more than 2 weeks in Korea. We investigated associations between mental health consultation rates for depressive symptoms and sociodemographic, socioeconomic, and health-related factors. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the significance of associations.
   Results: Among participants who report depressive symptoms, 16.0% (n = 2120) undergo mental health consultation. Respondents with a college education or over are more likely to undergo mental health consultation (odds ratio (OR) = 1.49; 95% CI: 1.21-1.84) than respondents with less education. Individuals aged 70 years or above are less likely to receive mental health consultation than those aged between 19 and 29 years. Females exhibit higher mental health consultation rates than males. Respondents who are divorced show greater odds of receiving mental health consultation than respondents who are married and cohabitate with their spouse.
   Conclusions: This study indicates that rates of use of mental health consultation services are lower among older adults and men and higher among divorced people. Educational level shows a significant positive association with mental health consultation among Koreans. The results could have implications for mental health policy in many ways in Korea.

AB Background. We examined associations between suicidality and genotypes that predict plasma efavirenz exposure among AIDS Clinical Trials Group study participants in the United States.
   Methods. Four clinical trials randomly assigned treatment-naive participants to efavirenz-containing regimens; suicidality was defined as reported suicidal ideation or attempted or completed suicide. Genotypes that predict plasma efavirenz exposure were defined by CYP2B6 and CYP2A6 polymorphisms. Associations were evaluated with weighted Cox proportional hazards models stratified by race/ethnicity. Additional analyses adjusted for genetic ancestry and selected covariates.
   Results. Among 1833 participants, suicidality was documented in 41 in exposed analyses, and 34 in on-treatment analyses. In unadjusted analyses based on 12 genotype levels, suicidality increased per level in exposed (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, .96-1.27) and on-treatment 1.16; 1.01-1.34) analyses. In the on-treatment analysis, the association was strongest among white but nearly null among black participants. Considering 3 metabolizer levels (extensive, intermediate and slow), slow metabolizers were at increased risk. Results were similar after baseline covariate-adjustment for genetic ancestry, sex, age, weight, injection drug use history, and psychiatric history or recent psychoactive medication.
   Conclusions. Genotypes that predict higher plasma efavirenz exposure were associated with increased risk of suicidality. Strength of association varied by race/ethnicity.

AB Compared to the general pediatric population, children with autism have higher rates of co-occurring medical and psychiatric illnesses, yet very little is known about the general health status of adults with autism. The objective of this study was to describe the frequency of psychiatric and medical conditions among a large, diverse, insured population of adults with autism in the United States. Participants were adult members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California enrolled from 2008 to 2012. Autism spectrum disorder cases (N=1507) were adults with autism spectrum disorder diagnoses (International Classification of Diseases-9-Clinical Modification codes 299.0, 299.8, 299.9) recorded in medical records on at least two separate occasions. Controls (N=15,070) were adults without any autism spectrum disorder diagnoses sampled at a 10:1 ratio and frequency matched to cases on sex and age. Adults with autism had significantly increased rates of all major psychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, and suicide attempts. Nearly all medical conditions were significantly more common in adults with autism, including immune conditions, gastrointestinal and sleep disorders, seizure, obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes. Rarer conditions, such as stroke and Parkinson's disease, were also significantly more common among adults with autism. Future research is needed to understand the social, healthcare access, and biological factors underlying these observations.

   prevention research
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID SURVEY NONRESPONSE; TELEPHONE SURVEYS; UNITED-STATES; VIOLENCE
AB Prevention research in public health requires quality data. In injury prevention research, "official" data sources, such as medical or law enforcement data, often do not possess the required depth or completeness. Self-reported data can fill this gap. Such data allow us to understand knowledge, attitudes, exposures, and behaviors associated with injury risk. Self-reported data are also needed to understand outcomes that are often missing from official sources, such as victimization by an intimate partner that is not reported because of concerns about legal consequences and less severe injuries from suicide attempts that go untreated. Data on risk and protective factors and specific types of violence exposures can often only be obtained by directly asking those affected. In addition, "official" data sources are rarely representative. Random-digit-dialing (RDD) surveys are a method of obtaining representative self-reported data. The RDD approach is relatively cost effective, handles non-English-speaking households with relative ease, and possesses a well-developed theory for constructing sample weights. However, there are significant challenges to using RDD surveys. These include declining participation rates; possible self-selection bias, since potential respondents can choose to opt out of the survey; and, with sensitive topics such as intimate partner violence, the need to anticipate potential risks for participants. This theme issue provides suggestions for how we can improve the design and implementation of RDD surveys in a manner that is both practical and ethical.

AB Worldwide, over 1000 people were executed in 2016 and over 3000 sentenced to death. Death row prisoners have high rates of mental illness, often combined with neurological impairment. Prolonged confinement has further negative effects on psychological function. There is a growing literature examining key themes and psychological constructs in death row prisoners immediately prior to execution. To date, this literature centres largely but not exclusively on last statements from death row in Texas, owing to ease of availability. The most common themes in last statements are love, spirituality and apology or regret. The most common psychological constructs are 'identification-egression' (e.g. attachment to a lost person or ideal, such as freedom), unbearable psychological pain and rejection-aggression. This is still a relatively new area of research and new techniques, such as computerised quantitative text analysis, are likely to complement rather than replace more traditional forms of thematic and textual analysis. For the future, it is essential that studies in this field continue to specify precisely, which last statements they use, so that overlap can be identified, and that more countries are studied (if possible). It would also be useful to expand the research frame to relate the content of last statements to additional variables relating to prisoners' offences, physical health, mental health, family structure and broader circumstances. Finally, ethical issues require continued consideration in this complex, fascinating, growing field.

AB Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an important cause of preventable deaths. The goal of this study was to provide data on epidemiology of TBI in Austria.
   Data on all hospital discharges, outpatients, and extra- as well as in-hospital deaths due to TBI were collected from various sources for the years 2009-2011. Population data (number of male/female people per age-group, population of Austrian cities, towns, and villages) for 2009-2011 were collected from the national statistical office. Incidence, case fatality rate(s) (CFR), and mortality rate(s) (MR) were calculated for the whole population and for age groups.
   Incidence (303/100,000/year), CFR (3.6 %), and MR (11/100,000/year) of TBI in Austria are comparable with those from other European countries. We found a high rate of geriatric TBI. The ratio between male and female cases was 1.4:1 for all cases, and was 2.2:1 for fatal cases. The most common mechanism was falls; traffic accidents accounted for only 7 % of the cases. Males died more frequently from traffic accidents and suicides, and females died more frequently from falls. CFRs and MRs increased with increasing age. CFRs were higher in patients from less populated areas, and MRs were lower in cases who lived closer to hospitals that admitted TBI.
   The high rate of geriatric TBI warrants better prevention of falls in this age group.

AB The Short-Term Assessment of Risk and Treatability: Adolescent Version (START: AV) is a new structured professional judgment guide for assessing short-term risks in adolescents. The scheme may be distinguished from other youth risk assessment and treatment planning instruments by its inclusion of 23 dynamic factors that are each rated for both vulnerability and strength. In addition, START: AV is also unique in that it focuses on multiple adverse outcomes-namely, violence, self-harm, suicide, unauthorized leave, substance abuse, self-neglect, victimization, and general offending-over the short-term (i.e., weeks to months) rather than long-term (i.e., years). This article describes a pilot implementation and preliminary evaluation of START: AV in three secure juvenile correctional facilities in the southern United States. Specifically, we examined the descriptive characteristics and psychometric properties of START:AV assessments completed by 21 case managers on 291 adolescent offenders (250 boys and 41 girls) at the time of admission. Results provide preliminary support for the feasibility of completing START: AV assessments as part of routine practice. Findings also highlight differences in the characteristics of START: AV assessments for boys and girls and differential associations between the eight START: AV risk domains. Though results are promising, further research is needed to establish the reliability and validity of START: AV assessments completed in the field.

AB The capability of conventional air gun lead pellets (diabolo pellets) to cause severe injuries or fatalities even at low kinetic energy levels is well documented in medical literature. Modern composite hunting pellets, usually a metal core (made of steel, lead, zinc, or a zinc and aluminum alloy) encased in a plastic sleeve, are of special forensic and traumatological interest. These projectiles are advertised by the manufacturers to discharge at higher velocities than conventional air gun pellets, thus generating very high tissue-penetrating capabilities. Lack of experimental data on these uncommon air gun projectiles induced this work. Ballistic parameters of 12 different caliber .177 (4.5 mm) composite pellets, discharged from two spring-piston air guns (Weihrauch HW 35, Webley CUB) and three pneumatic air guns (Walther LGR, Walther LG400, Walther LP300), were investigated using a ballistic speed measurement system and compared to a conventional diabolo pellet (RWS Meisterkugel) as reference projectile. Although overall results were inconsistent, for some projectile-weapon combinations (particularly spring-piston air guns), a significant change of the kinetic energy (-53 up to +48 %) to the reference projectile was observed. The data provided in this work may serve as a basis for forensic investigation as well as traumatological diagnosis and treatment of injuries caused by these uncommon projectiles.

AB Alcohol dependence and alcohol abuse or harmful use cause substantial morbidity and mortality. Alcohol-use disorders are associated with depressive episodes, severe anxiety, insomnia, suicide, and abuse of other drugs. Continued heavy alcohol use also shortens the onset of heart disease, stroke, cancers, and liver cirrhosis, by affecting the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and immune systems. Heavy drinking can also cause mild anterograde amnesias, temporary cognitive deficits, sleep problems, and peripheral neuropathy; cause gastroinestinal problems; decrease bone density and production of blood cells; and cause fetal alcohol syndrome. Alcohol-use disorders complicate assessment and treatment of other medical and psychiatric problems. Standard criteria for alcohol dependence-the more severe disorder-can be used to reliably identify people for whom drinking causes major physiological consequences and persistent impairment of quality of life and ability to function. Clinicians should routinely screen for alcohol disorders, using clinical interviews, questionnaires, blood tests, or a combination of these methods. Causes include environmental factors and specific genes that affect the risk of alcohol-use disorders, including genes for enzymes that metabolise alcohol, such as alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase; those associated with disinhibition; and those that confer a low sensitivity to alcohol. Treatment can include motivational interviewing to help people to evaluate their situations, brief interventions to facilitate more healthy behaviours, detoxification to address withdrawal symptoms, cognitive-behavioural therapies to avoid relapses, and judicious use of drugs to diminish cravings or discourage relapses.

ID MENTAL-HEALTH SURVEY; UNITED-STATES; EPIDEMIOLOGY; COMORBIDITY; CARE
AB Background. There have been few large-scale epidemiological studies which have examined the prevalence of bipolar disorder. The authors report 12-month prevalence data for DSM-IV bipolar disorder from the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Well-Being.
   Method. The broad methodology of the Australian National Survey has been described previously. Ten thousand, six hundred and forty-one people participated. The 12-month prevalence of euphoric bipolar disorder (I and 11) - similar to the euphoric-grandiose syndrome of Kessler and co-workers - was determined. Those so identified were compared with subjects with major depressive disorder and the rest of the sample, on rates of co-morbidity with anxiety and substance use disorders as well as demographic features and measures of disability and service utilization. Polychotomous logistic regression was used to study the relationship between the three samples and these dependent variables.
   Results. There was a 12-month prevalence of 0.5 % for bipolar disorder. Compared with subjects with major depressive disorder, those with bipolar disorder were distinguished by a more equal gender ratio; a greater likelihood of being widowed, separated or divorced; higher rates of drug abuse or dependence; greater disability as measured by days out of role; increased rates of treatment with medicines; and higher lifetime rates of suicide attempts.
   Conclusions. This large national survey highlights the marked functional impairment caused by bipolar disorder, even when compared with major depressive disorder.

AB BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers experience a disproportionately high frequency of workplace assaults. Incidents involving firearms are of particular concern.
   OBJECTIVE: To provide detailed characterizations of recent hospital shootings to better inform prevention and mitigation strategies.
   METHODS: Quantitative content analysis of reports involving hospital shootings resulting in casualties derived from web searches for each year from 2012-2016. Data were abstracted independently by two investigators, with differences resolved by consensus. Data were compared between subgroups by chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, or Kruskal-Wallis test, as appropriate.
   RESULTS: Eighty-eight shootings occurred in 86 hospitals resulting in 121 firearms-related casualties, including 54 victims and 67 perpetrators. Case fatality rates were 55.6% (n = 30) and 70.1% (n = 47), respectively. The most frequent sites involved were the emergency department, (n = 27, 30.3%), patient room (n = 19, 21.3%), and parking lot (n = 13, 14.6%). Grudge (n = 17, 19.3%), suicide (n = 14, 15.9%), and mental instability (n = 13, 14.8%) were the most common explanations for these shootings. Four inadvertent discharges occurred and were more likely to involve a female perpetrator (p = 0.03). Shootings were most frequent during summer (p = 0.03) and winter (p = 0.04).
   CONCLUSIONS: Out study findings on location and seasonal patterns can guide the development or improvement of prevention and mitigations strategies for hospital shootings.

AB In the aftermath of the September 11 attack on America, thrill-motivated hate crimes tended to decline as the rate of violent crime generally declined, but defensive hate crimes seemed to increase substantially. Just as individual factors were important in accounting for thrill-motivated hate attacks, so group factors became important for the purpose of explaining defensive hate crimes. The purpose of the present study was to apply group threat theorizing to explain increases in hate crimes against various groups since the 9/11 attack on America. In particular, we examined the prevalence of hate-motivated assaults against Muslims, Jews, gays, Blacks, and Latinos. Two separate data sources were employed: newspaper articles from LexisNexis and the Southern Poverty Law Center hate incidents spreadsheet. To control for changes in the level of hate crimes generally over time, we examined the percentage of hate-motivated assaults overall (in addition to their frequency of occurrence) that were directed at particular groups by the year in which they occurred. Our results indicated that hate-motivated assaults in the aftermath of 9/11 seemed to be driven to an increasing extent by a series of group threats in the wider society. Our results suggest that defensive assaults tend to peak when a particular group is regarded as representing a danger to the dominant group's prestige, wealth, or power.

After extensive post-marketing analysis and epidemiological studies regarding its safety, sertindole was relaunched in Europe in 2005.
   Areas covered: Sertindole is an efficacious antipsychotic that possesses superior efficacy compared with haloperidol, similar efficacy compared with risperidone, and slightly inferior efficacy compared with olanzapine. Sertindole has been shown in seven randomized, double-blind clinical trials to be a well-tolerated antipsychotic with placebo-level sedation and extrapyramidal symptoms. The long-term effectiveness and tolerability of sertindole was documented in a 52-week clinical trial. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), however, has yet to accept the manufacturer's claims that sertindole reduces the risk of suicide and that it is safe for patients with schizophrenia. The safety concerns for sertindole, especially focusing on cardiac adverse events, are addressed through contemporary database search along with cross-reference check.
   Expert opinion: While it has been reapproved by the European Commission, concerns still exist regarding its association with prolongation of QT intervals and dysrhythmias. Moreover, a consensus has not yet been established for clinical practice. The most conservative clinical use of sertindole at this time should be only after at least one antipsychotic medication failure and with a clear benefit/risk evaluation.

AB Background: In most European countries and in the US, there has been a negative trend with increasing incident rates of drug related deaths (DRD) during the last decade. In 2017, the mortality rate due to overdoses reached epidemic proportions in the United States; i.e. the age-adjusted rate of drug overdoses reached 21.7 per 100,000, being 9.6% higher than the 2016 rate. Increasing, still lower, rates are seen in European countries. Behind these figures are many bereaved persons left behind in quiet grief. Results: Research has shown that other kinds of unnatural deaths (e.g. resulting from accident, suicide, homicide) in particular, can lead to intense suffering and reduce quality of life for those left behind. Still, drug death bereaved persons seem to be an understudied, stigmatized and invisible social group. In this paper, we review previous research and deal with strain and stigmatization before drug related deaths and The Special Grief after such deaths. Discussion: We will discuss the possibility of different grief reactions as anticipated-, disenfranchized- and Prolonged Grief Disorder among family members and close friends. Furthermore, we focus on how the phenomenology of grief is connected to contextual and personal relations and interpersonal processes. Finally, we discuss the usefulness of a relational dialectics? perspective and a family perspective for understanding and relating to The Special Grief.

AB Advanced practice providers (APPs) have come to play an increasingly significant role in the United States healthcare system in the past five decades, particularly in primary care. The first portion of this paper will explore the utilization of APPs in specific patient populations: pediatrics, obstetrics, geriatrics, and psychiatry. After a brief discussion of the demand for these specialties, the authors will outline the educational preparation and competencies that nurse practitioners and physician assistants must achieve before working with these special populations. Finally, the authors will discuss the current and future roles of APPs in pediatric, obstetric, geriatric, and psychiatric populations.
   Simulated patient interactions and scenarios have become integrated into clinical education for many health care providers. Although traditionally utilized only in emergency medicine education, medical simulation has grown to become a staple of training in nearly every area of medicine. Healthcare providers of all levels can benefit from both individual and team-based training designed to improve everything from patient communication to procedural competence. The flexible nature of simulation training allows for customized teaching that is directly relevant to a specific specialty. The second half of this paper will demonstrate simulation's versatilite applications in the specialty areas of urgent care, pediatrics, mental health, geriatrics, and obstetrics.

AB In contrast with most developed countries, mortality due to ischemic heart disease (IHD) continues to rise in China. We examined the effects of age, period, and cohort on IHD mortality in urban and rural populations from 1987 to 2013 to identify the drivers of this trend. Region-specific data on annual IHD mortality among adults aged 20 to 84 years and corresponding population statistics were collected. We then tested for age, period, and cohort effects using the Intrinsic Estimator approach. Our results indicated that IHD mortality in China increased significantly over the three decades studied. There was a log-linear increase in the age effect on IHD mortality as those aged 80-84 showed 277 and 161 times greater IHD mortality risk than those aged 20-24 in urban and rural populations, respectively. While there was an upward trend in the period effect in both populations, the influence of the cohort effect on mortality decreased over time for those born from 1904 to 1993. The age, period, and cohort effects on mortality in China were generally comparable between urban and rural populations. The results suggest that population aging is a major driver behind the rapid rise in IHD mortality. Increased exposure to air pollution may also have played a role in driving the period effect.

AB Important gaps exist in our understanding of aggressive behavior and the extent to which aggression involves one or more types of victims. This information is critical for determining the utility of integrated approaches for violence prevention versus continuation of independent efforts for reducing community violence, partner violence, and child maltreatment. To better understand the overlap in aggressive behaviors within the general population, the authors examine the co-occurrence of self-reports of physically striking strangers, acquaintances, intimate partners, and children among a nationally representative sample of 3,024 U.S. adults. The findings from this cross-sectional random digit dial telephone survey show that more than a third of the population reports engaging in at least one form of aggression and that, of these, a third had perpetrated violence against more than one type of victim. The percent of respondents who reported perpetrating violence against more than one type of victim range from 13% (percent of those striking a friend or acquaintance who also struck a child) to 34% (percent of those striking a friend or acquaintance who also struck a stranger). Furthermore, engaging in one type of aggression substantially increases the odds of engaging in another from 1.5 to 4 times. The findings suggest potential value in pursuing both integrated and independent approaches in research and prevention.

AB Resilience research has principally identified protective factors that contribute to adaptation in the face of adversity. Clinical research has identified common factors as important in achieving recovery with clinical samples. Interestingly resilient and clinical samples have often experienced comparable adversities, but have very different developmental trajectories and outcomes. Equally interesting are the similarities and differences between protective factors associated with resilience and the common factors from clinical research. Important themes in both research areas are interpersonal competence and relations, structure, attributions and cognitive flexibility. These communalities may be of importance in improving adaptation and coping among clinical samples.
   Coping is linked to the preservation of mental health, which is a growing concern. The World Health Organization estimates that mental disorders affect some 450 million people at any given moment (WHO, 2003). Mood disorders are the most frequent affecting an estimated 121 million world wide, and 850 000 suicides pr year. The extent of mental disorders is growing. Depression is the leading cause of disability as measured by years lived with disability and the 4th leading contributor to the global burden of disease (DALYs) in 2000. By the year 2020, depression is projected to reach 2nd place of the ranking of DALYs calcuated for all ages, both sexes. Today, depression is already the 2nd cause of DALYs in the age category 15-44 years for both sexes combined.

AB Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurologic disorder that mostly affects young adults and can usually evolute to physical disability. Thus, caring patients with MS brings many ethic questions for the physician. Objective: To identify physicians and patients' perceptions about the illness and so improve doctor-patient relationship. Method: it was made two different questionnaires, one for patients and another for physicians, 103 patients and 44 physicians answered them. Results: 96.1% of patients knew their diagnosis, all others would like to know it. From those, 74.7% thought that that way it was disclosured was correct and 90.9% said that the doctor should tell us it. The worst symptoms described were fatigue (29.1%) and motor deficits (28.1%). By other side, 68% of patients told they suffered because of the illness. The most important reason for doctors to tell the diagnosis to the patients was to improve adherence to treatment (56.8%). A familiar present at this moment was demanded for 54.6% of doctors. When asked about orientations in a pregnancy, 50% of physicians did not answer correctly. Finally, 50% of physicians were against complementary and alternative therapies. Conclusion: Patients want to know their diagnosis and doctors should tell them in the most adequate moment and give more information. A debate about palliative care is also necessary.

AB ObjectiveThis study assessed the unique coping strategies of transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) individuals in the United States used to manage gender-related stress, and examined associations between specific coping profiles and mental health.
   MethodsData were from 316 participants in the 2014-2015 Transgender Stress and Health Study, an online study of TGNC mental and sexual health. A factor analysis of the coping measure (Brief COPE) was followed by a k-means cluster analysis to evaluate distinct profiles of coping with gender-related stress. Proportional odds models and logistic regression models indicated how coping profiles related to levels of self-reported depressive symptoms and suicidality.
   ResultsA 4-factor structure was identified with three distinct profiles of coping with gender-related stress, each representative of the frequency (high or low) in which participants used functional and dysfunctional coping strategies: (a) high-functional/low-dysfunctional, (b) high-functional/high-dysfunctional, and (c) low-functional/low-dysfunctional. There were significant differences in depressive symptoms and suicidality based on distinct gender-related coping profiles. The high-functional/high-dysfunctional group reported significantly poorer mental health compared with the high-functional/low-dysfunctional group.
   ConclusionTo improve mental health outcomes in TGNC individuals, health providers and researchers should strive to not only promote functional coping strategies for managing gender-related stress but also decrease dysfunctional coping strategies. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB It is often presumed that infertility is not a problem in resource-poor areas where fertility rates are high. This is challenged by consistent evidence that the consequences of childlessness are very severe in low-income countries, particularly for women. In these settings, childless women are frequently stigmatized, isolated, ostracized, disinherited and neglected by the family and local community. This may result in physical and psychological abuse, polygamy and even suicide. Attitudes among people in high-income countries towards provision of infertility care in low-income countries have mostly been either dismissive or indifferent as it is argued that scarce healthcare resources should be directed towards reducing fertility and restricting population growth. However, recognition of the plight of infertile couples in low-income settings is growing. One of the United Nation's Millennium Development Goals was for universal access to reproductive health care by 2015, and WHO has recommended that infertility be considered a global health problem and stated the need for adaptation of assisted reproductive technology in low-resource countries. This paper challenges the construct that infertility is not a serious problem in resource-constrained settings and argues that there is a need for infertility care, including affordable assisted reproduction treatment, in these settings.

AB Objectives. We determined if the installation of gun cabinets improved household firearm storage practices.
   Methods. We used a wait list, randomized trial design with 2 groups. The "early" group received the intervention at baseline, and the "late" group received it at 12 months. Up to 2 gun cabinets were installed in each enrolled home, along with safety messages. In-person surveys were conducted at 12 and 18 months to determine the proportion of households reporting unlocked guns or ammunition. Direct observations of unlocked guns were also compared.
   Results. At baseline, 93% of homes reported having at least 1 unlocked gun in the home, and 89% reported unlocked ammunition. At 12 months, 35% of homes in the early group reported unlocked guns compared with 89% in the late group (P<.001). Thirty-six percent of the early homes reported unlocked ammunition compared with 84% of late homes (P<.001). The prevalence of these storage practices was maintained at 18 months. Observations of unlocked guns decreased significantly (from 20% to 8%) between groups (P<.03).
   Conclusions. Gun cabinet installation in rural Alaskan households improved the storage of guns and ammunition. If these gains are sustained over time, it may lead to a reduction in gun-related injuries and deaths in this population. (Am J Public Health. 2012;102:S291-S297. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2011.300421)

AB Aim: In 2002, the Dutch Euthanasia Act came into effect, which made euthanasia available to individuals from the age of 12 and above. The objective of our study was to gain insight into how Dutch paediatricians and other physicians treating children feel about the regulation of physician-assisted dying.
   Methods: We interviewed 63 paediatricians, 125 general practitioners and 208 clinical specialists about their views on physician-assisted dying and the Euthanasia Act.
   Results: Of the paediatricians, 44% agreed with the age limit of 12 years, and 52% agreed with the requirement that parents be involved. Somewhat more than half thought the Act could contribute to the disclosure of end-of-life practices (52%), the quality of the review procedure (61%), careful decision making (54%) and the reporting rate (65%). These percentages were comparable for other physicians. A minority of the physicians in all groups indicated that, with this Act in place, they would be more willing to report such practices. The most optimistic in this respect were the paediatricians, of whom 39% expected such an effect.
   Conclusions: About half of Dutch paediatricians support the Euthanasia Act and expect it to achieve its aims, which is the same percentage as was found for other clinical specialists and general practitioners. However, most physicians do not foresee an increase in willingness to report cases of physician-assisted dying.

   PREVALENCE; GESTURES; IDEATION; VERSION; TRENDS; 5-YEAR
AB Background
   Clinical samples have identified a number of psychosocial risk factors for suicidal acts but it is unclear if these findings relate to the general population.
   Aims
   To describe the prevalence of and psychosocial risk factors for suicidal acts in a general adult population.
   Method
   Data were obtained from a Canadian epidemiological survey of 36984 respondents aged 15 years and older (weighted sample n=23652430).
   Results
   Of these respondents, 0.6% (weighted n=130143) endorsed a 12-month suicidal act. Female gender (OR=4.27, 95% CI 4.05-4.50), being separated (OR=37.88, 95% CI 33.92-42.31) or divorced (OR=7.79, 95% CI 7.22-8.41), being unemployed (OR=1.70, 95% CI 1.50-1.80), experiencing a chronic physical health condition (OR=1.70, 95% CI 1.67-1.86) and experiencing a major depressive episode in the same 12-month period as the act (OR=9.10, 95% CI 8.65-9.59) were significantly associated with a suicidal act.
   Conclusions
   The psychosocial correlates of suicidal acts in this sample are consistent with those previously reported in clinical and general population samples. These findings reinforce the importance of the determination of suicide risk and its prevention not only of psychiatric illness but of physical and psychosocial factors as well.

TI Comparison of the Safety Planning Intervention With Follow-up vs Usual

AB IMPORTANCE Suicidal behavior is a major public health problem in the United States. The suicide rate has steadily increased over the past 2 decades; middle-aged men and military veterans are at particularly high risk. There is a dearth of empirically supported brief intervention strategies to address this problem in health care settings generally and particularly in emergency departments (EDs), where many suicidal patients present for care.
   OBJECTIVE To determine whether the Safety Planning Intervention (SPI), administered in EDs with follow-up contact for suicidal patients, was associated with reduced suicidal behavior and improved outpatient treatment engagement in the 6 months following discharge, an established high-risk period.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cohort comparison design with 6-month follow-up at 9 EDs (5 intervention sites and 4 control sites) in Veterans Health Administration hospital EDs. Patients were eligible for the study if they were 18 years or older, had an ED visit for a suicide-related concern, had inpatient hospitalization not clinically indicated, and were able to read English. Data were collected between 2010 and 2015; data were analyzed between 2016 and 2018.
   INTERVENTIONS The intervention combines SPI and telephone follow-up. The SPI was defined as a brief clinical intervention that combined evidence-based strategies to reduce suicidal behavior through a prioritized list of coping skills and strategies. In telephone follow-up, patients were contacted at least 2 times to monitor suicide risk, review and revise the SPI, and support treatment engagement.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Suicidal behavior and behavioral health outpatient services extracted from medical records for 6 months following ED discharge.
   RESULTS Of the 1640 total patients, 1186 were in the intervention group and 454 were in the comparison group. Patients in the intervention group had a mean (SD) age of 47.15 (14.89) years and 88.5% were men (n = 1050); patients in the comparison group had a mean (SD) age of 49.38 (14.47) years and 88.1% were men (n = 400). Patients in the SPI+ condition were less likely to engage in suicidal behavior (n = 36 of 1186; 3.03%) than those receiving usual care (n = 24 of 454; 5.29%) during the 6-month follow-up period. The SPI+ was associated with 45% fewer suicidal behaviors, approximately halving the odds of suicidal behavior over 6 months (odds ratio. 0.56; 95% CI, 0.33-0.95, P = .03). Intervention patients had more than double the odds of attending at least 1 outpatient mental health visit (odds ratio, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.57-2.71; P < .001).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This large-scale cohort comparison study found that SPI+ was associated with a reduction in suicidal behavior and increased treatment engagement among suicidal patients following ED discharge and may be a valuable clinical tool in health care settings.

AB Introduction: Several high-profile cases in the U.S. have drawn public attention to the use of lethal force by law enforcement (LE), yet research on such fatalities is limited. Using data from a public health surveillance system, this study examined the characteristics and circumstances of these violent deaths to inform prevention.
   Methods: All fatalities (N=812) resulting from use of lethal force by on-duty LE from 2009 to 2012 in 17 U.S. states were examined using National Violent Death Reporting System data. Case narratives were coded for additional incident circumstances.
   Results: Victims were majority white (52%) but disproportionately black (32%) with a fatality rate 2.8 times higher among blacks than whites. Most victims were reported to be armed (83%); however, black victims were more likely to be unarmed (14.8%) than white (9.4%) or Hispanic (5.8%) victims. Fatality rates among military veterans/active duty service members were 1.4 times greater than among their civilian counterparts. Four case subtypes were examined based on themes that emerged in incident narratives: about 22% of cases were mental health related; 18% were suspected "suicide by cop" incidents, with white victims more likely than black or Hispanic victims to die in these circumstances; 14% involved intimate partner violence; and about 6% were unintentional deaths due to LE action. Another 53% of cases were unclassified and did not fall into a coded subtype. Regression analyses identified victim and incident characteristics associated with each case subtype and unclassified cases.
   Conclusions: Knowledge about circumstances of deaths due to the use of lethal force can inform the development of prevention strategies, improve risk assessment, and modify LE response to increase the safety of communities and officers and prevent fatalities associated with LE intervention.

AB Stress precipitates depression and significantly influences its course and severity. The neurobiology and clinical manifestation of the stress response and depression are similar, but in depression, the features persist and override the usual counter-regulating forces. Both the stress response and depression are characterized by hyperarousal, anxiety, increased expectation of harm, fixation of mood, and a bias towards well-rehearsed, relatively automatic cognitive programs. Furthermore, each is associated with preferential access to negatively charged emotional memories that emerge unconsciously, usually without identifiable cognitive content. The same stress-responsive CNS mediators that produce emotional, cognitive, and behavioral manifestations also lead to inhibition of endocrine programs for growth and reproduction to preserve energy, a catabolic state to provide glucose to the brain, and increased heart rate and blood pressure. While these phenomena are transient during stress, they may become chronic in depression, overriding their usual counter-regulatory influences. These biological phenomena constitute the basis for the now well-documented fact that depression is associated with a doubling of mortality at any age, independent of smoking, other physical risk factors, and suicide. Thus, depression is not only a state of anguish, but also the tip of the iceberg of a systemic disorder that leads to illness and significantly shortens life. Psychotherapy plays an enormously critical role in the treatment of any depression. The intersection of stressful, disturbing life experiences encoded in emotional memory, as well as genetic vulnerability provide the context for understanding how psychotherapeutic intervention can influence a disorder with biological vulnerability that is responsive to somatic treatments. Indeed, current well-controlled data indicate that pharmacological intervention is significantly more effective when combined with psychotherapy. Otherwise, unfortunate circumstances during childhood or later, persistent maladaptive behavioral patterns that increase the likelihood of stressful events, and a massive, untouched burden of aversively charged memories cam overwhelm skillful psychopharmacologic intervention.

AB BACKGROUND In the past decade, more than 300,000 people in the United States have died from firearm injuries. Our goal was to assess the effectiveness of two particular prevention strategies, restrictive licensing of firearms and concealed carry laws, on firearm-related injuries in the US Restrictive Licensing was defined to include denials of ownership for various offenses, such as performing background checks for domestic violence and felony convictions. Concealed carry laws allow licensed individuals to carry concealed weapons.
   METHODS A comprehensive review of the literature was performed. We used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology to assess the breadth and quality of the data specific to our Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes (PICO) questions.
   RESULTS A total of 4673 studies were initially identified, then seven more added after two subsequent, additional literature reviews. Of these, 3,623 remained after removing duplicates; 225 case reports, case series, and reviews were excluded, and 3,379 studies were removed because they did not focus on prevention or did not address our comparators of interest. This left a total of 14 studies which merited inclusion for PICO 1 and 13 studies which merited inclusion for PICO 2.
   CONCLUSION PICO 1: We recommend the use of restrictive licensing to reduce firearm-related injuries. PICO 2: We recommend against the use of concealed carry laws to reduce firearm-related injuries. This committee found an association between more restrictive licensing and lower firearm injury rates. All 14 studies were population-based, longitudinal, used modeling to control for covariates, and 11 of the 14 were multi-state. Twelve of the studies reported reductions in firearm injuries, from 7% to 40%. We found no consistent effect of concealed carry laws. Of note, the varied quality of the available data demonstrates a significant information gap, and this committee recommends that we as a society foster a nurturing and encouraging environment that can strengthen future evidence based guidelines.

TI Regulating a novel drug: An evaluation of changes in use of <i>Salvia
   divinorum</i> in the first year of Florida's ban
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY
LA English
DT Article
DE Salvia divinorum; Salvinorum A; Hallucinogen; Drug regulation
ID SALVINORIN-A; PATTERNS; TRENDS; IMPACT
AB Background: A plant with dissociative and psychoactive properties began to attract the attention of the media and United States policymakers following a well-publicized suicide in 2006 and reports that the plant served as a 'legal high' and substitute for cannabis. As a result, Salvia divinorum and its active ingredient, salvinorin A. were classified as Schedule I substances by the Florida Legislature on July 1, 2008. As of yet, no research has explored the efficacy of this policy or similar policies in other jurisdictions.
   Methods: Three self-report studies collected from young adults both prior to and following the policy's implementation are employed to investigate the potential relationship between the policy and usage rates. In addition, law enforcement personnel from the state's most populated areas were interviewed to determine the extent to which they were encountering salvia in their work.
   Results: It was indicated that less than two-thirds of those surveyed were aware of the drug's legal status. Lifetime prevalence of salvia use was largely unchanged. However, the rates of self-reported past year and past month use in Florida were significantly lower following the scheduling. Though use of Salvia divinorum appears to have decreased, perceptions of peer use increased markedly. Law enforcement officers and laboratories reported rarely, if ever, dealing with cases of salvia possession.
   Conclusions: Data suggests the classification of Salvia divinorum as a Schedule I drug was followed by a substantial reduction in recreational use. We caution that other factors may have influenced use, that the efficacy of scheduling novel substances is likely to vary by drug type, that such a reduction in reported use may only exist transiently until a sophisticated illicit market develops to replace the legitimate one, and that a state's success in regulating salvia may be related to their regulation of and enforcement of other drug prohibitions.

AB Goldstein BI, Liu S-Min, Schaffer A, Sala R, Blanco C. Obesity and the three-year longitudinal course of bipolar disorder. Bipolar Disord 2013: 00: 000000. (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.Published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd. Objectives: Despite substantial cross-sectional evidence that obesity is associated with an increased medical and psychiatric burden in bipolar disorder (BD), few longitudinal studies have examined this topic. Methods: Subjects with BD (n=1600) who completed both Wave 1 and Wave 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions were included. Analyses examined the association between obesity at Wave 1, and the subsequent course of BD, and of psychiatric and medical comorbidities, between Wave 1 and Wave 2. Results: BD subjects with obesity (n=506; 29.43%), compared to BD subjects without obesity (n=1094; 70.57%) were significantly more likely to have a major depressive episode and to receive counseling for depression during follow-up, more likely to report a lifetime suicide attempt, and less likely to develop new-onset alcohol use disorders. These differences were no longer significant, however, after controlling for baseline demographic variables. No significant differences in new episodes or treatment of mania/hypomania were observed. After controlling for demographic variables, obese subjects remained significantly more likely to report any new-onset medical condition [odds ratio (OR) = 2.32, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.633.30], new-onset hypertension (OR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.162.82) and arthritis (OR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.072.52). Obese subjects were significantly more likely to report physician-diagnosed diabetes (OR = 6.98, 95% CI: 4.2711.40) and hyperlipidemia (OR = 2.32, 95% CI: 1.633.30) (assessed in Wave 2 only). The incidence of heart attacks was doubled among obese subjects, although this difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions: The association between obesity and increased prospective depressive burden appears to be explained by baseline demographic variables. By contrast, obesity independently predicts the accumulation of medical conditions among adults with BD. Treatment of obesity could potentially mitigate the psychiatric and medical burden of BD.

AB Background. Depressive disorders represent a major public health concern, regarding their high frequency and their important cost. Depression impair the quality of life more than any other disease, sometimes leading to suicidal ideas or behavior. Indeed, 50% of patients with severe major depression commit suicide. Numerous studies showed that depressive disorders are frequently not recognised, and regularly untreated. In France, where at least 3 millions of inhabitants are concerned, 38% of depressed patients are not using any health system. When they are asking for care, the majority of depressed patients visit their general practitioner (51%), whereas less than 10% visit a psychiatrist. Even when the diagnostic is correct, the treatment prescribed is not systematically relevant. The treatment is, for example, frequently proposed for a too short period, and sometimes the prescribed product does not have proven antidepressive efficacy. Furthermore, as incorrect informations are frequently given to patients, and as there is a general biased judgement about psychotropic drugs in the general population, the compliance is usually poor for antidepressive treatment Therefore, only a small minority of depressed patients benefits from an adequate care. Public health information methodological asperts. To improve this situation, delivering simple and clear-cut recommendations cannot be considered as sufficiently effective, and public health interventions are required. Different programs improving the recognition of depressive disorders have already been tested in some countries with encouraging results. These programs are based on information campaigns given to the public, and the training of general practitioners about the management of depressive disorders. The << Defeat Depression >> campaign in Great-Britain and the << National Depression Screening Day >> in the United-States of America may represent informative examples. Restricting these programs to general practitioners only is frequently criticized, as this may reduce efficacy. A multilevel approach is crucial for the success of action programmes against depression, because synergistic effects can be expected. In Germany, the << Nurnberger Bundnis gegen Depression >> project was based on four levels, and effectively reduced the suicide rate. These levels of action included << cooperation with GPs >>, such as training sessions based on video, and presence of a phone hotline, << public relations activities >> << training sessions for multipliers >>, such as priests, social workers and media, and << special offers for high risk groups and self-help activities >>. In France, such a program is clearly required.

AB Backgroun: Family members do not have an official position in the practice of euthanasia and physician assisted suicide (EAS) in the Netherlands according to statutory regulations and related guidelines. However, recent empirical findings on the influence of family members on EAS decision-making raise practical and ethical questions. Therefore, the aim of this review is to explore how family members are involved in the Dutch practice of EAS according to empirical research, and to map out themes that could serve as a starting point for further empirical and ethical inquiry.
   Methods: A systematic mixed studies review was performed. The databases Pubmed, Embase, PsycInfo, and Emcare were searched to identify empirical studies describing any aspect of the involvement of family members before, during and after EAS in the Netherlands from 1980 till 2018. Thematic analysis was chosen as method to synthesize the quantitative and qualitative studies.
   Results: Sixty-six studies were identified. Only 14 studies had family members themselves as study participants. Four themes emerged from the thematic analysis. 1) Family-related reasons (not) to request EAS. 2) Roles and responsibilities of family members during EAS decision-making and performance. 3) Families' experiences and grief after EAS. 4) Family and 'the good euthanasia death' according to Dutch physicians.
   Conclusion: Family members seem to be active participants in EAS decision-making, which goes hand in hand with ambivalent feelings and experiences. Considerations about family members and the social context appear to be very important for patients and physicians when they request or grant a request for EAS. Although further empirical research is needed to assess the depth and generalizability of the results, this review provides a new perspective on EAS decision-making and challenges the Dutch ethical-legal framework of EAS. Euthanasia decision-making is typically framed in the patient-physician dyad, while a patient-physician-family triad seems more appropriate to describe what happens in clinical practice. This perspective raises questions about the interpretation of autonomy, the origins of suffering underlying requests for EAS, and the responsibilities of physicians during EAS decision-making.

AB Objective
   To characterize treatment-seeking young adults (16-25 years) with severe obesity, particularly mental health problems.
   Study Design and Participants
   Cross-sectional study of 165 participants (132 women, 33 men) with BMI >= 35 kg/m(2) or >= 30 kg/m(2) with comorbidities, enrolling in a multidisciplinary obesity treatment program.
   Method
   Data collection at admission of present and life-time health issues including symptomatology of anxiety, depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (Adult ADHD Self-Report scale); self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale), suicide attempts, health-related quality of life (Short Form-36 Health Survey), psychosocial functioning related to obesity (Obesity-related Problems Scale), cardiorespiratory fitness (Astrand's bicycle ergometer test), somatic and psychiatric comorbidities, cardiometabolic risk factors, and micronutritional status. We used multiple regression analysis to identify variables independently associated with present anxiety and depressive symptomatology.
   Results
   Mean body mass index was 39.2 kg/m(2) (SD = 5.2). We found evidence of poor mental health, including present psychiatric diagnoses (29%), symptomatology of anxiety (47%), depression (27%) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (37%); low self-esteem (42%), attempted suicide (12%), and low quality of life (physical component score = 46, SD = 11.2; mental component score = 36, SD = 13.9, P<0.001 for difference). Variables independently associated with present anxiety symptomatology (R-2 = 0.33, P<0.001) included low selfesteem (P<0.001) and pain (P = 0.003), whereas present depressive symptomatology (R-2 = 0.38, P<0.001) was independently associated with low self-esteem (P<0.001), low cardiorespiratory fitness (P = 0.009) and obesity-related problems (P = 0.018). The prevalence of type 2 diabetes was 3%, and hypertension 2%. Insulin resistance was present in 82%, lipid abnormality in 62%, and poor cardiorespiratory fitness in 92%. Forty-eight percent had at least one micronutritional deficiency, vitamin D being the most common (35%).
   Conclusion
   A wide range of health issues, including quite severe mental health problems, was prevalent in treatment-seeking young adults with severe obesity. These are likely to constitute a major treatment challenge, including options relating to bariatric surgery.

AB This is a time of turmoil in the United States health care system. Political discussions center mostly around financial issues, but these issues have serious implications for the elderly population, the fastest growing segment of the general population. What will be done with Medicare is still unknown at this time, but whatever is done will have great impact on health care for the elderly. Information gathered over the last 1-2 decades indicates clearly that cardiothoracic surgery in the elderly is associated with outcomes, including mortality and resource use, that is little different from that of the younger people - higher mortality rates are associated with comorbidities, more frequent in older individuals, not with age. There is a temptation to discount the remaining few years of life of people who have already lived out most of their days, but how is one to determine the value of one life over another?
   General ethical problems that affect everyone have particular relevance to the elderly. For example, it is more important for elderly individuals to execute advance directives, as the potential for needing them is closer at hand than it is for younger people. The elderly are more likely to refuse curative care, and when little more can be done for their diseases, they will have need for palliative care. Perioperative management must be much more meticulous in the elderly for both technical and ethical reasons; for example, preoperative planning for changing the goals of treatment if serious complications occur is especially important if we are to avoid marching along the road to futility. The high incidence of dementia in the elderly also raises questions of decision-making capacity when the need for surgery arises, or when they are asked to participate as patient-subjects in clinical investigations. Although there are special ethical concerns for individuals over the age of 70 or 80 years, when they present with a cardiothoracic surgical problem, they become our patients and deserve the best that we can offer them.

AB Background: Health care providers have been encouraged to discuss firearms with patients; whether patients view these discussions as appropriate is unclear.
   Objective: To estimate, in a national sample, the perceived appropriateness of provider discussions about firearms.
   Design: Probability-based online survey conducted in April 2015. Analyses used survey weights to generate nationally representative estimates.
   Setting: U.S. adults.
   Participants: 3914 English-speaking adults (55% participation rate).
   Measurements: Participants were asked, "In general, would you think it is never, sometimes, usually, or always appropriate for physicians and other health professionals to talk to their patients about firearms?"
   Results: A majority (66% [95% CI, 63% to 69%]) of participants said that it is at least sometimes appropriate for providers to talk to patients about firearms. Specifically, 23% (CI, 20% to 25%) said that provider discussions about firearms were always appropriate, 14% (CI, 11% to 16%) said that they were usually appropriate, and 30% (CI, 27% to 33%) thought they were sometimes appropriate; 34% (CI, 31% to 37%) felt that such discussions were never appropriate. Views varied by firearm ownership: 54% (CI, 52% to 57%) of gun owners said that provider discussions are at least sometimes appropriate, compared with 67% (CI, 62% to 71%) of nonowners living with an owner and 70% (CI, 66% to 74%) of nonowners not living with an owner. Firearm owners who were more likely to think that firearm discussions are at least sometimes appropriate included those with children at home (62% [CI, 57% to 67%]), those who thought that having a gun at home increases suicide risk (75% [CI, 67% to 83%), and those who thought that provider discussions of seat belts are at least sometimes appropriate (73% [CI, 70% to 75%]).
   Limitations: The provider discussion question did not specify clinical context.
   Conclusion: Two thirds of non-firearm owners and over one half of firearm owners in the United States believe that health care provider discussions about firearms are at least sometimes appropriate. The observed heterogeneity underscores the need to better understand assumptions that may underlie these views, particularly among firearm owners.

AB Context: Little is known about selecting among secondstep medications for major depressive disorder after intolerance or lack of remissionwith an initial selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
   Objective: To determine whether sociodemographic, clinical, or first- step treatment features predict remission with or intolerance overall or differentially to any 1 of 3 second- step medications after an unsatisfactory outcome with citalopram hydrobromide.
   Design: An equipoise stratified randomized study. Participants were recruited from July 17, 2001, through April 20, 2004.
   Setting: Public or private sector primary care ( n= 18) and psychiatric care ( n= 23) settings across the United States.
   Participants: Representative outpatients aged 18 to 75 years with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder ( N= 727).
   Interventions: Sustained- release bupropion hydrochloride was started at 150 mg/ d and incrementally increased to 400 mg/ d. Sertraline hydrochloride was started at 50 mg/ d and incrementally increased to 200 mg/ d. Extendedrelease venlafaxine hydrochloride was started at 37.5 mg/ d and incrementally increased to 375 mg/ d.
   Main Outcome Measures: The 16- item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Self- Rated and the Frequency, Intensity, and Burden of Side Effects Rating.
   Results: Remission was more likely among participants who were white, employed, cohabiting or married, or privately insured or who had prior intolerance to citalopram or at least a response to citalopram, and no prior suicide attempts. Remission was less likely among participants with concurrent generalized anxiety, obsessivecompulsive, panic, or posttraumatic stress disorders; social phobia; anxious or melancholic features; or more severe depression. Intolerance was less likely for Hispanic participants, but more likely for participants with previous suicide attempts or intolerance to citalopram. Participants with concurrent substance use were less likely to remit ( odds ratio, 0.37) and more likely not to tolerate extended- release venlafaxine. Intolerance to citalopram was associated with intolerance to sertraline ( P=. 04).
   Conclusions: Clinical, demographic, and treatment history were of little value in recommending 1 medication vs another as a second- step treatment for major depressive disorder. Participants most likely to remit in the second step had less Axis I psychiatric disorder comorbidity, less social disadvantage, and at least a response to citalopram in the first step.

ID RELIABILITY
AB Problem: Priority health-risk behaviors contribute to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among youth and adults. Population-based data on these behaviors at the national, state, and local levels can help monitor the effectiveness of public health interventions designed to protect and promote the health of youth nationwide.
   Reporting Period Covered: September 2014-December 2015.
   Description of the System: The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors six categories of priority health behaviors among youth and young adults: 1) behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence; 2) tobacco use; 3) alcohol and other drug use; 4) sexual behaviors related to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; 5) unhealthy dietary behaviors; and 6) physical inactivity. In addition, YRBSS monitors the prevalence of obesity and asthma and other priority health behaviors. YRBSS includes a national school-based Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) conducted by CDC and state and large urban school district school-based YRBSs conducted by state and local education and health agencies. This report summarizes results for 118 health behaviors plus obesity, overweight, and asthma from the 2015 national survey, 37 state surveys, and 19 large urban school district surveys conducted among students in grades 9-12.
   Results: Results from the 2015 national YRBS indicated that many high school students are engaged in priority health-risk behaviors associated with the leading causes of death among persons aged 10-24 years in the United States. During the 30 days before the survey, 41.5% of high school students nationwide among the 61.3% who drove a car or other vehicle during the 30 days before the survey had texted or e-mailed while driving, 32.8% had drunk alcohol, and 21.7% had used marijuana. During the 12 months before the survey, 15.5% had been electronically bullied, 20.2% had been bullied on school property, and 8.6% had attempted suicide. Many high school students are engaged in sexual risk behaviors related to unintended pregnancies and STIs, including HIV infection. Nationwide, 41.2% of students had ever had sexual intercourse, 30.1% had had sexual intercourse during the 3 months before the survey (i.e., currently sexually active), and 11.5% had had sexual intercourse with four or more persons during their life. Among currently sexually active students, 56.9% had used a condom during their last sexual intercourse. Results from the 2015 national YRBS also indicated many high school students are engaged in behaviors associated with chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. During the 30 days before the survey, 10.8% of high school students had smoked cigarettes and 7.3% had used smokeless tobacco. During the 7 days before the survey, 5.2% of high school students had not eaten fruit or drunk 100% fruit juices and 6.7% had not eaten vegetables. More than one third (41.7%) had played video or computer games or used a computer for something that was not school work for 3 or more hours per day on an average school day and 14.3% had not participated in at least 60 minutes of any kind of physical activity that increased their heart rate and made them breathe hard on at least 1 day during the 7 days before the survey. Further, 13.9% had obesity and 16.0% were overweight.
   Interpretation: Many high school students engage in behaviors that place them at risk for the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of most health behaviors varies by sex, race/ethnicity, and grade and across states and large urban school districts. Long-term temporal changes also have occurred. Since the earliest year of data collection, the prevalence of most healthrisk behaviors has decreased (e.g., riding with a driver who had been drinking alcohol, physical fighting, current cigarette use, current alcohol use, and current sexual activity), but the prevalence of other behaviors and health outcomes has not changed (e.g., suicide attempts treated by a doctor or nurse, smokeless tobacco use, having ever used marijuana, and attending physical education classes) or has increased (e.g., having not gone to school because of safety concerns, obesity, overweight, not eating vegetables, and not drinking milk). Monitoring emerging risk behaviors (e.g., texting and driving, bullying, and electronic vapor product use) is important to understand how they might vary over time.
   Public Health Action: YRBSS data are used widely to compare the prevalence of health behaviors among subpopulations of students; assess trends in health behaviors over time; monitor progress toward achieving 21 national health objectives for Healthy People 2020 and one of the 26 leading health indicators; provide comparable state and large urban school district data; and help develop and evaluate school and community policies, programs, and practices designed to decrease health-risk behaviors and improve health outcomes among youth.

TI The fating game and erotic asphyxiation: From voluntary and temporary
   asphyxiation to addiction?
SO ANNALES MEDICO-PSYCHOLOGIQUES
LA French
DT Article
DE Addiction; Choking game; Fating game; Paraphilia; Prevention
ID AUTOEROTIC ASPHYXIATION; UNITED-STATES; CHOKING GAME; SUICIDE; DEATHS
AB Introduction. - There are two forms of voluntary and temporary asphyxiation: the "fainting game" better known as "the choking game", "blackout", "space monkey" and the erotic asphyxiation. These conducts involve inducing cerebral hypoxia with the aim of developing an altered, euphoric-like state. Unlike the choking game, erotic asphyxiation implies a sexual activity. The objective of our work is to describe these two types of asphyxiation, which are little known by the medical world and nevertheless responsible of numerous complications, including death.
   Method. - We performed a systematic review (Medline, Science Direct) between January 1988 and August 2011 to identify the frequency, as well as the clinical and psychopathological data, and to present available ways of screening and management.
   Results. - These practices correspond to two different categories. The fating game of concerns teenager risk behaviors. Erotic asphyxiation is a characteristic of young adult masochistic activity. Both of these practices pose the risk of evolving towards a behavioral addiction. According to the model of the affective-behavioral addiction, the fainting game has an addictive potential mainly for teenagers displaying mental and other addictive disorders. The erotic asphyxiation dependence is considered to be a paraphiliac addiction, which also features the tolerance mechanism. Consequently, dependent subjects experience the need to escalate exposure in order to reach the same level of pleasure. They increase the number, the time and the intensity of hypoxia, thus heightening the risk of death and complications. A behavioral addiction is therefore regarded as a risk factor.
   Conclusion. - We encourage clinicians to acquaint themselves with the main alert signs (preexisting risk factors, behavior modifications, neck erythema, unexplained somatic disorders) to screen patients for this type of conduct and to take into account such an addictive component in clinical settings.

   ACUTE MANIA; LITHIUM; COMBINATION
AB Background: Many patients with bipolar disorder receive multi-drug treatment regimens, but the distinguishing profiles of patients who receive complex pharmacologies have not been established.
   Method: Prescribing patterns of lithium, anti-convulsants, antidepressants, and antipsychotics were examined for 4035 subjects with bipolar disorder (DSM-IV) immediately prior to entering the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD), Subjects were recruited for participation across 22 centers in the United States between November 1999 and July 2005. The quality receiver operating characteristic (ROC) method was used to develop composite profiles of patients receiving complex regimens (p < .01 for all iterations).
   Results: Use of 3 or more medications occurred in 40% of subjects, while 18% received 4 or more agents. Quality ROC analyses revealed that subjects had a 64% risk for receiving a complex regimen (>= 4 medications) if they had (I) ever taken an atypical antipsychotic, (2) >= 6 lifetime depressive episodes, (3) attempted suicide, and (4) an annual income >= $75,000. Complex polypharmacy was least often associated with lithium, divalproex, or carbamaze-pine and most often associated with atypical antipsychotics or antidepressants. Contrary to expectations, a history of psychosis, age at onset, bipolar I versus 11 subtype, history of rapid cycling, prior hospitalizations, Current illness state, and history of alcohol or substance use disorders did not significantly alter the risk profiles for receiving complex regimens.
   Conclusion: Complex polypharmacy involving at least 4 medications occurs in approximately I in 5 individuals with bipolar disorder. Use of traditional mood stabilizers is associated with fewer cotherapies. Complex regimens are especially common in patients with substantial depressive illness burden and suicidality, for whom simpler drug regimens may fail to produce acceptable levels of response.

TI New Zealanders' Attitudes toward Physician-Assisted Dying
SO JOURNAL OF PALLIATIVE MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID PSYCHIATRIC-CONSULTATION; EUTHANASIA; SUICIDE; DEATH; EXPERIENCES;
   DEPRESSION; REASONS; SUPPORT; PEOPLE
AB Objectives: Physician-assisted dying (PAD) is legal in several countries in Europe and some states of the United States. Despite regular societal debate in New Zealand about assisted dying, little is known about what the New Zealand public think about this issue. The present study was the first to examine New Zealanders' attitudes toward assisted dying in the context of various parameters of patient suffering, and as a public policy issue.
   Methods: Stratified random sampling techniques were used to elicit 677 participants from the electoral roll. They completed an anonymous questionnaire asking about the most appropriate medical response to patients who explicitly request assistance in dying, as well as their opinions around legalization of PAD.
   Results: Overall, 78% felt PAD was the most appropriate response in certain situations while 82% felt it should be legalized. When the patient was suffering from loss of dignity, PAD was considered the most appropriate response to patients' requests for assistance in dying by 75% of respondents; when the patient was suffering from intractable pain, 65% of respondents considered PAD the most appropriate response. Almost 65% of those who wanted PAD to be legalized felt it should only be accessible to those suffering unbearably with little hope of recovery, and 46% felt that the presence of mental illness should be an exclusionary factor.
   Conclusions: The results have highlighted the high value respondents place on patient autonomy with regards to end-of-life choices; however the choice to hasten death is not a 'right' that should be available to all. Results have clearly shown that New Zealanders believe regulation will play a key role in maintaining compliance with any assisted dying legislation, and in restricting access, so that only patients who are suffering intolerably and hopelessly are able to legally gain medical assistance to end their life.

   METAANALYSIS
AB Intake of nutrients fundamental for optimal neuronal function is of increasing interest. The potential importance of omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs) for optimizing emotional states, cognitive function, and mental health has been demonstrated in observational studies and randomized controlled trials. Omega-3 (HUFAs), specifically EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are concentrated in neural tissues and are essential for neural function, normative neurodevelopment, neurotransmitter, and neural immune functions. Omega-3 HUFAs must be obtained from the diet, predominantly from marine sources such as fish and other seafood. HUFAs also can be found in a variety of dietary supplements (omega-3 fatty acid esters, fish oil and krill oil). As dietary supplements, omega-3 HUFAs (fatty acid esters, fish and krill oils) differ substantially in their physicochemical properties and nutrient content. Here we present the design and methods for the Ranger Resilience and Improved Performance on Phospholipid bound Omega-3's (RRIPP-3) study. RRIPP-3 was a double blind, randomized, controlled trial among individuals in the United States (US) Army Infantry Basic Officer Leaders Course (IBOLC) and following US Ranger School training (RC) at Fort Benning, GA of omega-3 HUFA on krill oil versus placebo supplementation. The RRIPP-3 study sought to determine if krill oil supplementation with omega-3 HUFAs supports aspects of cognitive functioning critical to battlefield success when measured immediately after an intense combat simulation. Sub-analyses addressed basic improvements in IBOLC performance. We also describe additional outcome measures critical for interpretation of the study results, such as diet and other dietary supplement use.

AB Objectives: The purpose of this study is to explore behavioral health symptoms and characteristics of noninstitutionalized older adults newly started on an antidepressant, anxiolytic, or antipsychotic agent by nonpsychiatrist physicians. Design: Naturalistic cohort study of older adults participating in the Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly (PACE) of the state of Pennsylvania. Setting/Participants: Noninstitutionalized adults in Pennsylvania. Measurements: Standardized scales including the Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration (BOMC) test, Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (including Psychosis, Mania, Generalized Anxiety Disorder [GAD], Panic Disorder, and Alcohol Abuse/Dependence modules), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Paykel Scale for suicide ideation, and Medical Outcomes Survey (SF-12). Results: Participants were mostly women (83.7%) with a mean age of 79.2 years (SD 7.1). The average PHQ-9 score for those on antidepressants was 5.8 (5.2), with no statistically significant difference between medication groups (F-[2,F-409] = 1.48, p = 0.23); just seven (4.9%) of those receiving anxiolytics met criteria for an anxiety disorder, which was not significantly different than other medication classes (chi(2) (2) = 0.83, p = 0.66). Overall, 197 (47.8%) of the sample did not meet criteria for a mental health disorder. Just 69 (28.8%) of those on antidepressants reported depression as the self-reported reason for taking the medication, while 91 (22.8%) of the total reported poor sleep or stressful life events as the reason. Conclusions: In this sample, many older persons received psychotropic medications despite low symptomatology, increasing the costs of care and possible exposure to unnecessary side effects. It is important to understand perceived benefit to both patient and provider of such prescribing patterns and work towards minimizing unnecessary use. (Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 2011; 19: 851-858)

AB Objectives: To describe the incidences and causes of occupational police deaths in New York City in the United States and Greater London in the United Kingdom during the twentieth century. To assess the relation between overall societal violence and violence directed toward police officers in these metropolitan areas.
   Design and setting: Ecological study of New York and London from 1900 through 1999.
   Main outcome measures: Intentional and unintentional occupational police mortality rates for New York and London were estimated for each decade. The general population homicide rates of both New York and London were assessed for their correlation with their respective intentional occupational police mortality rates.
   Results: During the 20th century, 585 police officers in New York and 160 police officers in London died while participating in law enforcement activities. New York had markedly greater intentional police mortality rates compared to London throughout most of the 20th century, but these differences decreased significantly by the end of the century. Intentional gunshot wounds comprised 290 police deaths in New York, but only 14 police deaths in London. In New York, gun shot wounds ( both intentional and unintentional) accounted for more occupational police deaths (51.6%) than did all other injury mechanisms combined. In London, motor vehicle collision was the most common cause (47.5%) of occupational police death. There were no apparent correlations between the general population homicide rates and intentional police mortality rates in either New York (r(2) = 0.05, 95% CI -0.77 to 0.81) or London (r(2) = 0.34, 95% CI 20.61 to 0.89).
   Conclusions: During the 20th century, both intentional and unintentional occupational police mortality rates were significantly greater in New York compared to London. These differences are likely from several socioeconomic, cultural, and occupational factors. The declines in police deaths in New York during the latter part of the 20th century indicate that at least some measures taken by the New York Police Department have been successful at significantly reducing the incidence of both intentional and unintentional police deaths.

TI Should parents see their teen's medical record? Asking about the effect

   NOTIFICATION; INFORMATION
AB Objective: Parents routinely access young children's medical records, but medical societies strongly recommend confidential care during adolescence, and most medical centers restrict parental records access during the teen years. We sought to assess public opinion about adolescent medical privacy.
   Materials and Methods: The Cornell National Social Survey (CNSS) is an annual nationwide public opinion survey. We added questions about a) whether parents should be able to see their 16-year-old child's medical record, and b) whether teens would avoid discussing sensitive issues (sex, alcohol) with doctors if parents could see the record. Hypothesizing that highlighting the rationale for adolescent privacy would change opinions, we conducted an experiment by randomizing question order.
   Results: Most respondents (83.0%) believed that an adolescent would be less likely to discuss sensitive issues with doctors with parental medical record access; responses did not differ by question order (P = .29). Most also believed that parents should have access to teens' records, but support for parental access fell from 77% to 69% among those asked the teen withholding question first (P= .01).
   Conclusions: Although medical societies recommend confidential care for adolescents, public opinion is largely in favor of parental access. A brief "nudge," asking whether parental access might harm adolescent-doctor communication, increased acceptance of adolescent confidentiality, and could be part of a strategy to prepare parents for electronic patient portal policies that medical centers impose at the beginning of adolescence.

AB The aim of this study is to examine the changing patterns of child homicide in the USA and the other 9 major Western countries between 1974 and 1999. On the basis of standardized WHO mortality data, 5-year mean rates of Baby (< 1 year), Infant (1 - 4), Child (5 - 14), and General Population Rates for Homicide (GPRH) were analyzed for 1974 - 78 and 1995 - 99 for the USA and major Western countries. The analysis provided ratios of change for children's homicide between 1974 and 1999 and ratio of ratios between "adult'" and children's homicide. Over the period USA male Baby homicide rose by 78% and Females 44% with a combined rise in All Children [ 0 - 14] homicides of 45%, within the context of a declining adult GPRH. In the 1970s, 3 major Western countries had either higher or similar children's homicide rates to the USA, but by the late 1990s none did. Moreover, between 1974 and 1999, the USA had the biggest rise in Baby (< 1) and All Children's deaths, and only France had substantial increases, whereas Baby homicide rates fell significantly in 6 other countries. The findings indicate a worrying deterioration in U. S. child homicides. Possible links with child abuse and explanations for the results are briefly discussed. Urgent case-specific research is required to determine the cause/s for and how to reverse the worsening child homicide situation in the USA.

AB Background and Objectives: Psychological outcomes following termination of wanted pregnancies have not previously been studied. Does excluding such abortions affect estimates of psychological distress following abortion? To address this question this study examines long-term psychological outcomes by pregnancy intention (wanted or unwanted) following induced abortion relative to childbirth in the United States. Materials and Methods: Panel data on a nationally-representative cohort of 3935 ever-pregnant women assessed at mean age of 15, 22, and 28 years were examined from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). Relative risk (RR) and incident rate ratios (IRR) for time-dynamic mental health outcomes, conditioned by pregnancy intention and abortion exposure, were estimated from population-averaged longitudinal logistic and Poisson regression models, with extensive adjustment for sociodemographic differences, pregnancy and mental health history, and other confounding factors. Outcomes were assessed using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Version 4, American Psychiatric Association (DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria or another validated index for suicidal ideation, depression, and anxiety (affective problems); drug abuse, opioid abuse, alcohol abuse, and cannabis abuse (substance abuse problems); and summary total disorders. Results: Women who terminated one or more wanted pregnancies experienced a 43% higher risk of affective problems (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.3-2.2) relative to childbirth, compared to women terminating only unwanted pregnancies (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.0-1.4). Risks of depression (RR 2.22, 95% CI 1.3-3.8) and suicidality (RR 3.44 95% CI 1.5-7.7) were especially elevated with wanted pregnancy abortion. Relative risk of substance abuse disorders with any abortion was high, at about 2.0, but unaffected by pregnancy intention. Excluding wanted pregnancies artifactually reduced estimates of affective disorders by 72% from unity, substance abuse disorders by 11% from unity, and total disorders by 21% from unity. Conclusions: Excluding wanted pregnancies moderately understates overall risk and strongly understates affective risk of mental health difficulties for women following abortion. Compared to corresponding births, abortions of wanted pregnancies are associated with a greater risk of negative psychological affect, particularly depression and suicide ideation, but not greater risk of substance abuse, than are abortions of unwanted pregnancies. Clinical, research, and policy implications are discussed briefly.

AB Civilian firearm injury is an important public health concern in the United States. Gunshot wounds to the head (GSWH) remain in need of update and systematic characterization. We identify predictors of prolonged hospital length of stay (HLOS), intensive care unit length of stay (ICU LOS), medical complications, mortality, and discharge disposition from a population-based sample using the National Sample Program (NSP) of the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB), years 2003-2012. Statistical significance was assessed at < 0.001 to correct for multiple comparisons. In total, 8148 adult GSWH patients were included extrapolating to 32,439 national incidents. Age was 36.6 +/- 16.4 years and 64.4% were severe traumatic brain injury (TBI; Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score 3-8). Assault (49.2%), handgun (50.3%), and residential injury (43.2%) were of highest incidence. HLOS and ICU LOS were 7.7 +/- 14.2 and 5.7 +/- 13.4 days, respectively. Overall mortality was 54.6%; suicide/self-injury was associated with the highest mortality rate (71.6%). GCS, Injury Severity Score, and hypotension were significant predictors for outcomes overall. Medicare/Medicaid patients had longer HLOS compared to private/commercial insured (mean increase, 4.4 days; 95% confidence interval [2.6-6.3]). Compared to the Midwest, the South had longer HLOS (mean increase, 3.7 days; [2.0-5.4]) and higher odds of complications (odds ratio [OR], 1.7 [1.4-2.0]); the West had lower odds of complications (OR, 0.6; [0.5-0.7]). Versus handgun, shotgun (OR, 0.3; [0.2-0.4]) and hunting rifle (OR, 0.5; [0.4-0.8]) resulted in lower mortality. Patients with government/other insurance had higher odds of discharging home compared to private/commercially insured (OR, 1.7; [1.3-2.3]). In comparison to level I trauma centers, level II trauma centers had lower odds of discharge to home (OR, 0.7; [0.5-0.8]). Our results support hypotension, injury severity, injury intent, firearm type, and U.S. geographical location as important prognostic variables in firearm-related TBI. Improved understanding of civilian GSWH is critical to promoting increased awareness of firearm injuries as a public health concern and reducing its debilitating injury burden to patients, families, and healthcare systems.

AB Objective: Little is known about patient outcomes following discontinuation of opioid therapy, which may include suicidal ideation (SI) and suicidal self-directed violence (SSV). The purpose of this study was to examine correlates of SI and non-fatal SSV in a sample of patients discontinued from long-term opioid therapy (LTOT).
   Method: Five hundred-nine Veterans Health Administration (VHA) patients whose clinicians discontinued them from LTOT were selected from a national cohort of VHA patients who discontinued opioids in 2012. The sample comprised patients with a substance use disorder and matched controls. Patient electronic health records were manually reviewed to identify discontinuation reasons and the presence of SI or SSV in the 12 months following discontinuation.
   Results: Forty-seven patients (9.2%) had SI only, while 12 patients (2.4%) had SSV. In covariate-adjusted logistic regression models, mental health diagnoses associated with having SI/SSV included post-traumatic stress disorder (aOR = 2.56, 95% CI = 1.23-5.32) and psychotic disorders (aOR = 3.19, 95% CI = 1.14-8.89). Other medical comorbidities, substance use disorder and pain diagnoses, opioid dose, and benzodiazepine prescriptions were unrelated to SI/SSV.
   Conclusions: Among patients with a substance use disorder and matched controls, there are high rates of SI/SSV following opioid discontinuation, suggesting that these "high risk" patients may require close monitoring and risk prevention.

AB Objective: To examine national trends in mortality rates for injuries among Canadian children younger than 15 years in 1979-2002.
   Methods: Data on injury deaths were obtained from the Canadian Vital Statistics system at Statistics Canada. Injuries were classified using the codes for external cause of injury and poisoning (E-codes) by intent and by mechanism. Mortality rates were age adjusted to the 1990 world standard population. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate the secular trends.
   Results: Annual mortality rates for total and unintentional injuries declined substantially (from 23.8 and 21.7 in 1979 to 7.2 and 5.8 in 2002, respectively), whereas suicide deaths among children aged 10-14 showed an increasing trend. All Canadian provinces and territories showed a decreasing trend in mortality rates of total injuries. Motor vehicle related injuries were the most common cause of injury deaths (accounted for an average of 36.4% of total injury deaths), followed by suffocation (14.3%), drowning (13.5%), and burning (11.1%); however, suffocation was the leading cause for infants. The number of potential years of life lost due to injury before age 75 decreased from 89 343 in 1979 to 27 948 in 2002 for children aged 0-14 years.
   Conclusions: During the period 1979-2002, there were dramatic decreases in childhood mortality for total injuries and unintentional injuries as well as various degrees of reduction for all causes of injury except suffocation in children aged 10-14 years and drowning in infants. The reason for the reduction in injury mortality might be multifactoral.

AB Objectives. We described American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) infant and pediatric death rates and leading causes of death.
   Methods. We adjusted National Vital Statistics System mortality data for AI/AN racial misclassification by linkage with Indian Health Service (IHS) registration records. We determined average annual death rates and leading causes of death for 1999 to 2009 for AI/AN versus White infants and children. We limited the analysis to IHS Contract Health Service Delivery Area counties.
   Results. The AI/AN infant death rate was 914 (rate ratio [RR] = 1.61; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.55, 1.67). Sudden infant death syndrome, unintentional injuries, and influenza or pneumonia were more common in AI/AN versus White infants. The overall AI/AN pediatric death rates were 69.6 for ages 1 to 4 years (RR = 2.56; 95% CI = 2.38, 2.75), 28.9 for ages 5 to 9 years (RR = 2.12; 95% CI = 1.92, 2.34), 37.3 for ages 10 to 14 years (RR = 2.22; 95% CI = 2.04, 2.40), and 158.4 for ages 15 to 19 years (RR = 2.71; 95% CI = 2.60, 2.82). Unintentional injuries and suicide occurred at higher rates among AI/AN youths versus White youths.
   Conclusions. Death rates for AI/AN infants and children were higher than for Whites, with regional disparities. Several leading causes of death in the AI/AN pediatric population are potentially preventable.

AB BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to examine the impact of professional preparation and class structure on health content delivery and time spent delivering content among required health education classes in the United States.
   METHODS: Data from the classroom-level file of the 2006 School Health Policies and Programs Study were utilized. A series of multivariable logistic regression models were employed to determine if instruction of content was dependent on professional preparation and/or class structure. Years of teaching health topics and size of the school district were included as covariates in the multivariable logistic models. We also conducted a multivariable logistic regression model to examine if time spent teaching each topic area was dependent upon professional preparation and/or class structure.
   RESULTS: Findings indicated that professionally prepared teachers were significantly more likely to deliver content in 6 of 12 health topic areas when compared to untrained teachers. Class structure was also an important predictor of content delivery among many topic areas. Teachers who taught classes that were devoted to health instruction were significantly more likely to deliver content in the following topic areas: alcohol/drug prevention, tobacco prevention, sexuality, pregnancy, human immuno virus and sexually transmitted disease prevention, emotional/mental health and suicide, and violence prevention.
   CONCLUSIONS: Research concerning the relationship between professional preparation and teaching outcomes is scant. The present study indicates that health content coverage and time spent on instruction are associated with both professional preparation and class structure for many health content areas.

AB Research has demonstrated that military service members are at elevated risk for a range of psychiatric problems, and mental health services use is a conduit to symptom reduction and remission. Nonetheless, there is a notable underutilization of mental health services in this population. This systematic review aimed to identify and critically examine: (1) rates of service use; (2) barriers and facilitators to care; and (3) programs and interventions designed to enhance willingness to seek care and increase help-seeking behaviors among current military personnel (e.g., active duty, National Guard, Reserve). Overall, 111 peer-reviewed articles were identified for inclusion. Across studies, the rate of past-year service use among service members with mental health problems during the same time frame was 29.3% based on weighted averages. Studies identified common barriers to care (e.g., concerns regarding stigma, career impact) and facilitators to care (e.g., positive attitudes toward treatment, family/friend support, military leadership support) among this population. Although programs (e.g., screening, gatekeeper training) have been developed to reduce these barriers, leverage facilitators, and encourage service use, further research is needed to empirically test the effectiveness of these interventions in increasing rates of service utilization. Critical areas for future research on treatment engagement among this high-risk population are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To understand the determinants of the outcome of an episode of major depression, including factors that affect receipt of guideline-consistent care and their subsequent effect on treatment outcomes, particularly relapse or recurrence. Results of previous studies are generalized to a population typical of depressed individuals in the United States, ie, a cohort of antidepressant users with employer-provided health benefits.
   Study Design: A quasi-experimental design was used to assess the determinants of the outcome of an episode of major depression. Healthcare utilization-based measures of treatment characteristics and outcomes were used.
   Patients and Methods: The final analytical file for this study contained data on 2917 patients who had Bn antidepressant prescription associated with an indicator of a depressive disorder. We identified relapse or recurrence of depression by (1) a new episode of antidepressant therapy, (2) suicide attempt, (3) psychiatric hospitalization, (4) mental health-related emergency department visits, or (5) electroconvulsive therapy. Antidepressant use patterns were used to construct a measure for adherence to treatment guidelines. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard and logit regression models were used to predict relapse/recurrence and adherence with treatment guidelines, respectively, For each patient,
   Results: Factors that affect relapse/recurrence include comorbidities, demographics, and adherence to treatment guidelines. Factors that affect adherence to treatment guidelines include choice of initial antidepressant drug, comorbidities, psychotherapy, and frequency of physician visits.
   Conclusions: Adherence to treatment guidelines was associated with a significant reduction in the likelihood of relapse or recurrence of depression. Choice of initial antidepressant drug affects adherence to treatment guidelines.

TI Risk of death associated with kratom use compared to opioids

ID MITRAGYNA-SPECIOSA; NEGATIVE OUTCOMES; POLICY; POLITICIANS; CLINICIAN;
   HEALTH; IMPACT
AB Kratom use appears to be increasing across the United States, increasing attention to deaths in which kratom use was detected. Most such deaths have been ascribed to fentanyl, heroin, benzodiazepines, prescription opioids, cocaine and other causes (e.g., homicide, suicide and various preexisting diseases). Because kratom has certain opioid-like effects (e.g., pain relief), and is used by some people as a substitute for opioids for pain or addiction, kratom has been compared to "narcotic-like opioids" (e.g., morphine) with respect to risk of death despite evidence that its primary alkaloid, mitragynine, carries little of the signature respiratory depressing effects of morphine-like opioids. This commentary summarizes animal toxicology data, surveys and mortality data associated with opioids and kratom to provide a basis for estimating relative mortality risk. Population-level mortality estimates attributed to opioids as compared to kratom, and the per user mortality risks of opioids as compared to kratom are provided. By any of our assessments, it appears that the risk of overdose death is > 1000 times greater for opioids than for kratom. The limitations of the mortality risk estimate warrants caution in individuals with unknown factors such as use of other substances and medications, or other preexisting conditions. More research on kratom safety and risks is needed, as is regulation of commercial kratom products to ensure that consumers are informed by FDA labeling and that kratom products are not contaminated or adulterated with other substances.

   DEPRESSION; ADOLESCENTS; BARRIERS; YOUTH
AB Background: One in five adults are diagnosed with mental illness in the United States. Young adults, ages 18 to 25, have the highest prevalence of depression (10.9%). Depression is also a risk factor for suicide. The current study applied the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify the predictors that influence help-seeking intentions on utilization of mental health services among a diverse population of young adults. Methods: The study designed was a cross-sectional online survey of 18 to 24-year-old young adults (n= 430) who lived, worked, and/or attended school in San Francisco, California. The survey was available in English, Spanish, and Chinese; and accessible from August 2016 through March 2017. The online survey was a modified version of surveys developed by Mo and Mak, and Reavley and colleagues. Results: The demographic composition of the sample included: white (35.3%), Latino(a) (25.3%), and Chinese (21.6%); and primarily female (58.6%). Almost one-third of the participants (31.6%) screened positive for depression. Nearly half of the participants had ever met with a mental health professional (49.5%, n=213). There was a strong, positive correlation for attitude [r=.61, PDiscussion: The TPB variables, especially attitudes, were highly predictive in help-seeking intention for mental health services. Translation to Health Education Practice: Health Educators who work in college-based student health centers can use the findings to develop interventions at the individual and community levels.

AB Introduction. There is a paucity of information about risk behaviors in adolescents with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We designed this study to assess the prevalence of risk behaviors among teens with CKD in the United States and to investigate any associations between risk behavior and patient or disease characteristics. Methods. After informed consent, adolescents with CKD completed an anonymous, confidential, electronic web-based questionnaire to measure risk behaviors within five domains: sex, teen driving, alcohol and tobacco consumption, illicit drug use, and depression-related risk behavior. The reference group was composed of age-, gender-, and race-matched US high school students. Results. When compared with controls, teens with CKD showed significantly lower prevalence of risk behaviors, except for similar use of alcohol or illicit substances during sex (22.5% vs. 20.8%, p=0.71), feeling depressed for >= 2 weeks (24.3% vs. 29.1%, p=0.07), and suicide attempt resulting in injury needing medical attention (36.4% vs. 32.5%, p=0.78). Furthermore, the CKD group had low risk perception of cigarettes (28%), alcohol (34%), marijuana (50%), and illicit prescription drug (28%). Use of two or more substances was significantly associated with depression and suicidal attempts (p<0.05) among teens with CKD. Conclusions. Teens with CKD showed significantly lower prevalence of risk behaviors than controls. Certain patient characteristics were associated with increased risk behaviors among the CKD group. These data are somewhat reassuring, but children with CKD still need routine assessment of and counselling about risk behaviors.

AB Background: We have previously identified long-term individual predictors of hazardous drinking in doctors, but longitudinal studies on contextual factors (work and life stress) and mental distress being independently linked to hazardous drinking over the first 15 years of a medical career are lacking. Methods: Two nationwide cohorts of Norwegian doctors (n = 1,052) from all 4 Norwegian universities were surveyed in their final year of medical school (1993/1994 and 1999) (T1), and 4 (T2), 10 (T3), and 15 (T4) years later. Hazardous drinking was measured using a validated 9-item version of the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test. Work-related and other predictors were analysed using generalized estimating equations. Results: Ninety percent (947/1,052) responded at least once, and 42% (450/1,052) responded at all 4 time points. Hazardous drinking was reported by 16% at T1, 14% at T2 and T3, and 15% at T4. Life events (p = 0.009) and mental distress (p = 0.002) were adjusted predictors of hazardous drinking, in addition to male gender, no religious activity, drinking to cope with tension, and low conscientiousness. Conclusions: Doctors' work-related stress was not linked to hazardous drinking, but life events, mental distress, and drinking to cope were. Prevention should target mental distress and drinking to cope with tension. (C) 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel

ID ABUSE
AB The consequences of tobacco, alcohol, and drug use are some of the most common health problems that affect women. Since the majority of women in the United States visit the office of an obstetrician-gynecologist for routine care, obstetrics and gynecology physicians have the opportunity to prevent and treat substance use disorders in this population.
   Studies have shown that women will discuss their tobacco, alcohol, and drug use with their physicians, and many will respond to brief counseling and pharmacotherapy [ 1,2]. This is particularly true for women who use mood-altering drugs above recommended limits but who are not addicted or drug-dependent. Studies suggest that 24% of women smoke cigarettes, 21% drink above recommended limits, and 3% to 5% abuse illegal drugs and prescription medication [3]. Tobacco, alcohol, and drug use are implicated in many health problems, including sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), adverse pregnancy outcomes, trauma, breast and colon cancer, lung disease, cardiovascular disease, and fetal alcohol syndrome. Depression, domestic violence, and suicide are often linked to substance use. In addition, these drugs can affect the outcome of surgical procedures. Withdrawal from these drugs can compromise postoperative and postpartum care.
   Residents in obstetrics and gynecology need to recognize substance use disorders, as well as their health effects and treatment options. All obstetrics and gynecology residents are expected to meet the following objectives:
   1. Assess for evidence of substance abuse throughout the life span.
   2. Describe the teratogenic effects of nonprescription drugs (alcohol, heroin, cocaine, tobacco).
   3. Assess and evaluate for substance abuse in pregnancy.

AB Objective:To simultaneously examine characteristics associated with prescription opioid use, misuse, and use disorders among US adults and assess correlates of their motivations for prescription opioid misuse.
   Methods: Data were examined from 51,200 adults 18 years or older who participated in the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Prescription opioid use disorders were based on DSM-IV criteria. Bivariable and multivariable multinomial logistic regressions were applied.
   Results: Prescription opioid use disorders were associated with ages 18-29 and 30-49 years, male sex, good/fair/poor health, suicidal ideation, and tobacco use, alcohol or cocaine use disorders, heroin use or use disorders, and other psychotropic medication misuse or use disorders. Among US adult prescription opioid misusers, 63.4% reported that the main motivation for their most recent misuse was to relieve physical pain, followed by seeking to get high (11.6%) or to relax (10.9%). Sociodemographic characteristics, mental illness, and specific substance use and use disorders were associated with specific motivations for misusing prescription opioids. Among adults with prescription opioid use, reporting pain relief as a motivation for prescription opioid misuse was associated with suicidal ideation, cannabis and heroin use or use disorders, cocaine use disorders, and other psychotropic misuse or use disorders.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that clinicians should assess prescription opioid misuse and its motivations and screen for multiple co-occurring behavioral health conditions in patients who misuse prescription opioids.

ID INTIMATE PARTNER HOMICIDE; UNITED-STATES; SUICIDE; COVERAGE; VIOLENCE
AB The purpose of this investigation was to provide an analysis of the 166 homicidal deaths that occurred in Southern Denmark during 25 years. The inspiration came from increased press coverage of certain homicides that I as a forensic pathologist felt did not mirror the real situation. Extensive press coverage of a few serious cases has left the public with the impression that the number of homicides was escalating, and this has been cause for public concern, and has prompted various harsh legislative steps. A lot of public interest has been focused on knife homicides, on honor killings among Muslims, on gang homicides and on homicides committed by psychotic individuals. The political response to public opinion has to some degree been focused on increased punishment for violence. With this in mind, the aim of the investigation was to answer the following research questions: :
   Research Question 1: What was the homicide rate in the study area, and has it changed during the 25-year study period?
   Research Question 2: How were the homicides distributed according to motive?
   Research Question 3: How often was the homicide motivated by a psychosis?
   Research Question 4: Has the ratio between intra- and extra-family homicides changed?
   Research Question 5: How often were weapons used?
   Research Question 6: Is it possible to identify some important social factors characterizing homicide victims?
   Research Question 7: Has the homicide pattern described changed over time?
   Research Question 8: What are the implications of this study for homicide prevention strategies?.

AB Objectives: To examine trends in inequality in life expectancy and age-specific death rates across 40 US spatial units from 1990 to 2016.
   Methods: We use multiple cause-of-death data from vital statistics to estimate measures of inequality in mortality across metropolitan status and geographic region. We consider trends for 5-year age intervals and examine inequality in cause-specific mortality.
   Results: For both sexes, spatial inequality in life expectancy and all-cause mortality above age 25 rose between 2002-04 and 2014-16. During this period, the standard deviation in life expectancy at birth increased by 19% for males and by 44% for females. Areas that had higher life expectancy at the beginning of the period enjoyed larger gains in life expectancy. Especially noteworthy are divergent trends between large central metropolitan areas on the coasts and non-metropolitan areas in Appalachia and the South. Spatial inequality in mortality from lung cancer/respiratory diseases rose substantially, particularly for older women. Spatial inequality in mortality from the combination of drug overdose, alcohol use, and suicide increased at ages 30-34, but declined at ages 50-54 and 70-74. Inequality in mortality from circulatory diseases, the largest cause of death, grew for some groups, particularly 30-34 year-old women. Mortality from screenable cancers, an indicator of the performance of medical systems, showed relatively little spatial disparity during the period.
   Conclusions: Spatial inequality in life expectancy at birth and adult mortality has increased in recent decades.

AB Background Public and stakeholder engagement can improve the quality of both research and policy decision making. However, such engagement poses significant methodological challenges in terms of collecting and analysing input from large, diverse groups.
   Objective To explain how online approaches can facilitate iterative stakeholder engagement, to describe how input from large and diverse stakeholder groups can be analysed and to propose a collaborative learning framework (CLF) to interpret stakeholder engagement results.
   Methods We use 'A National Conversation on Reducing the Burden of Suicide in the United States' as a case study of online stakeholder engagement and employ a Bayesian data modelling approach to develop a CLF.
   Results Our data modelling results identified six distinct stakeholder clusters that varied in the degree of individual articulation and group agreement and exhibited one of the three learning styles: learning towards consensus, learning by contrast and groupthink. Learning by contrast was the most common, or dominant, learning style in this study.
   Conclusion Study results were used to develop a CLF, which helps explore multitude of stakeholder perspectives; identifies clusters of participants with similar shifts in beliefs; offers an empirically derived indicator of engagement quality; and helps determine the dominant learning style. The ability to detect learning by contrast helps illustrate differences in stakeholder perspectives, which may help policymakers, including Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, make better decisions by soliciting and incorporating input from patients, caregivers, health-care providers and researchers. Study results have important implications for soliciting and incorporating input from stakeholders with different interests and perspectives.

ID RECEPTOR SUBTYPES; PLASMA
AB Diphenidol hydrochloride (DPN), a nonphenothiazinic antiemetic agent used primarily in patients with Meniere disease and labyrinthopathies to treat vomiting and vertigo, is considered to be a relatively safe drug. Since it was first approved in the United States in 1967, this drug has been widely used in Latin America and Asia and has contributed to sporadic suicidal and accidental poisonings in mainland China and Taiwan. However, its toxic or lethal concentration ranges have not yet been determined. We report a case of a 23-year-old female who suffered from DPN poisoning that resulted in death. At autopsy, there were no typical pathological findings, except for cerebral edema with high acetylcholinesterase expression. Postmortem analysis of DPN revealed 45 A mu g/ml in heart blood, 39 A mu g/ml in femoral vein blood, 141 A mu g/g in the liver, and 53 mg in the gastric contents. These concentrations indicated that the cause of death was DPN poisoning. The circumstances indicated that the manner of death was suicide. We also present a retrospective study, in which we review and summarize the literature from 1998 to 2014 and describe 16 cases of poisoning, including information from autopsy reports and postmortem drug concentrations. In forensic practice, drug residues at the scene, patients with convulsions and disturbance of consciousness, and rapidly occurring deaths, should draw attention to the possibility of this drug. Toxicological analysis and the exclusion of other diseases may ultimately be used to confirm DPN poisoning.

ID COMMERCIAL SPEECH
AB According to the Surgeon General, tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States. Smoking-related diseases kill 443,000 Americans each year, more than are killed by HIV, illegal drug use, alcohol use, motor vehicle injuries, suicides, and murders combined. To address this public health threat, Congress enacted the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (TCA) in 2009, which gave the federal government unprecedented power to regulate the tobacco industry. Among its provisions, the TCA requires the US. Food and Drug Administration to select images that depict smoking's deleterious effects and compels tobacco companies to display the images, accompanied by a textual warning, on half of the front and rear panels of every cigarette package. This new graphic format the first alteration of cigarette package warnings in over twenty-five years represents a significant and aggressive change in the way that the government communicates the dangers of smoking to the public.
   To prevent the introduction of these new labels into the marketplace, the tobacco industry has filed suit alleging that the graphic warnings infringe on its First Amendment right to refrain from speaking. The two circuit courts that have considered this issue are divided sharply over the labels' constitutionality and the appropriate framework for assessing them. This Note examines this legal fissure and argues that the warnings should be examined under the strict scrutiny standard of judicial review. Ultimately, this Note contends that the labels do not pass muster under this intense level of scrutiny and are thus unconstitutional compulsions of speech.

   Methods. We analyzed data from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System. To generate a sufficient sample of Asian American and Pacific Islander students, we combined data from four nationally representative surveys of U.S. high school students conducted in 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007 (total n=56,773).
   Results. Asian American students were significantly less likely than Pacific Islander, white, black, or Hispanic students to have drunk alcohol or used marijuana. Asian American students also were the least likely to have carried a weapon, to have been in a physical fight, to have ever had sexual intercourse, or to be currently sexually active. Once sexually active, Asian American students were as likely as most other racial/ethnic groups to have used alcohol or drugs at last sexual intercourse or to have used a condom at last sexual intercourse. Pacific Islander students were significantly more likely than Asian American, white, black, or Hispanic students to have seriously considered or attempted suicide.
   Conclusions. The prevalence estimates of health-risk behaviors exhibited by Asian American students and Pacific Islander students are very different and should be reported separately whenever feasible. To address the different health-risk behaviors exhibited by Asian American and Pacific Islander students, prevention programs should use culturally sensitive strategies and materials.

AB Although many plans for peace in the Middle East have been proposed over the years, none have seriously considered the psychological needs that promote conflict and violence, and thus, far none have been successful. This chapter uses Terror Management Theory, which is a general theory of the role of culture and self-esteem in providing psychological security, to shed light on forces that motivate and perpetuate the ongoing cycle of violence in this region. From this perspective, threats to one's cultural worldviews and self-esteem promote violence because they undermine the ability of these psychological entities to provide the protection from anxiety that is needed for psychological well-being and effective functioning. Consequently, people disparage and lash out at those who threaten their worldviews and self-esteem. Research exploring the role of worldviews and self-esteem in providing security and the impact of threats to this security in promoting violence is reviewed, with special emphasis on the operation of these processes in promoting support for violence against perceived enemies in Israel, Iran, and the United States. This analysis also suggests factors that reduce support for violence; research demonstrating the impact of activating compassionate religious values, a sense of shared humanity, close interpersonal attachments, and removing the association between lofty values and violence is discussed.

AB Purpose: To determine the association between cancer diagnosis, mental disorders and suicidal behavior among community dwelling adults.
   Methods: Data were drawn from the nationally representative Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 1.2 (N = 36 984, response rate 77%, age 15+). Respondents were grouped into three age groups (15-54, 55-74, and 75+ years), and multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between cancer and mental disorders: unadjusted and adjusted for sociodemographics, social supports and other mental disorders.
   Results: Among respondents aged 15-54, cancer was associated with increased odds of major depression (odds ratio [OR] = 3.18; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.69-5.96), panic attacks (OR = 2.15; 95% CI: 1.22-3.77) and any mental disorder. Among respondents aged 55-75, cancer was associated with increased odds of agoraphobia (OR= 5.94; 95% CI: 1.68-21.03) and decreased odds of social phobia (OR = 0.22; 95% CI: 0.06-0.80). Cancer was not associated with any mental disorder in the 75+ age group. Results persisted after adjustments for the covariates. Suicidal ideation was associated with cancer in the 55-74 age group (OR = 5.07; 95% CI: 1.25-20.47) in unadjusted models; however, this relationship became nonsignificant when adjusting for the other covariates.
   Conclusion: Clinicians should consider screening for depression and panic disorder in young, community dwelling patients with cancer. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Background: This pilot study examined rates of major depression and suicidality and their associations with daily functioning in HIV infected (HIV+) and uninfected (HIV-) persons in China.
   Method: HIV+ participants (N=28) and demographically matched HIV- controls (N=23) completed the Chinese Composite International Diagnostic Interview to determine lifetime rates of major depressive disorder (MDD) and suicidality. Current mood and suicidal ideation were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-I. The impact of depression and HIV infection on daily functioning was measured by an Activity of Daily Living questionnaire.
   Results: Mean duration of known HIV+ status was 2 years. Almost 79% (n = 22) of HIV+ but just 4% (n = 1) of HIV- groups reported lifetime major depression. Of the 22 HIV+ individuals with lifetime MDD, only one had onset before learning of HIV status. The remainder developed MDD within 6 months after testing HIV positive. In those HIV+ subjects who met MDD criteria after HIV diagnosis, only two (9%) had received depression treatment, yet four (18%) had persisting active suicidal thoughts. Depression and HIV+ status independently predicted worse daily functioning.
   Limitations: Representativeness is limited in this small sample of convenience.
   Conclusion: This preliminary study presents evidence of high rates of major depression and suicidality in HIV-infected persons in China. Despite this, few had sought mental health assistance, suggesting a need to increase awareness of psychiatric comorbidity and access to mental health services. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB To examine both mental and physical health profiles of children diagnosed as maltreated in the community, we studied diagnoses in the electronic health records (EHRs) of youth assigned maltreatment-related diagnoses (N = 406) and well-matched youth without a maltreatment-related diagnosis (N = 406) during a four-year period in a large healthcare system that covers eight hospitals and over 40 clinics. Data extracted automatically from the EHRs was supplemented by manual chart review. The odds of the maltreated group being assigned a code for mental illness was 2.69 times higher than the odds for the comparison group, with large differences in mood and anxiety disorders and suicidality. The odds of having an injury or poisoning diagnosis were 3.45 times higher in maltreated than in comparison youth. Maltreated youth were also less likely to have been immunized. Nevertheless, contrary to our hypothesis, maltreated youth had significantly lower rates of diagnoses across almost all major physical disease categories assessed and did not differ from comparison youth in terms of body mass index (BMI). Furthermore, maltreated youth were assigned fewer diagnoses than comparison youth whether they came in for at least one preventive visit or not. Findings suggest a need for health care professionals to be prepared to address the high rates of mental disorders in maltreated youth, to be more vigilant about possible physical disorders in this population, and to take greater advantage of opportunities to immunize these youth.

AB Bisexual individuals are at higher risk for poor mental health outcomes compared to heterosexual as well as lesbian and gay individuals and experience minority stressors, such as discrimination, from both heterosexual and sexual minority communities. However, there is little research examining the negative effects of bisexual-specific minority stressors on bisexual individuals' mental health as well as psychological factors that might help explain minority stressors' deleterious effects. This research examined the effects of distal minority stressors (i.e., anti-bisexual experiences from both heterosexual as well as lesbian and gay people) and proximal stressors (i.e., internalized heterosexism and sexual orientation concealment) on psychological distress and suicidality among bisexual adults (N = 503). Building on the relational framing of the minority stress model, we also tested one relational factor (i.e., loneliness) as a mediator of the associations between distal and proximal minority stressors and poor mental health (i.e., psychological distress and suicidality). Structural equation modeling analyses were used to test the mediating effects of loneliness on the associations between minority stressors and psychological distress and suicidality. Although distal and proximal minority stressors were not associated with each other, loneliness mediated the effects of distal and proximal minority stressors on psychological distress and suicidality. The results of this study underscore the importance of targeting bisexual-specific minority stressors as well as loneliness in preventive interventions to improve the mental health of bisexual individuals.

AB The aim of this study was to examine epidemiologic data regarding acute herbicide or insecticide poisoning in adults from 2011 to 2014 at the national level in South Korea. Further, the association between governmental regulations involving pesticides and changes in pesticide poisoning occurrences over time was determined. Data were obtained from the emergency department (ED)-based Injury In-depth Surveillance system conducted by the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). Governmental regulations on pesticides were downloaded from the homepage of the Korea Rural Development Administration. Pesticides were classified according to guidelines provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) and by the respective Resistance Action Committee (RAC). Trends in the number of ED presentations and case fatality rate (CFR) due to pesticide poisoning were investigated. The overall CFR due to poisoning from herbicides or insecticides in adults in South Korea was 16.8% during 2011-2014. However, CFR significantly decreased over the 4-year period. The ED presentations of paraquat (PQ) poisoning fell significantly, whereas poisoning due to glyphosate, glufosinate, or combined herbicides increased markedly over the 4 years. Between 2011 and 2013, PQ was the most common pesticide poisoning, whereas glyphosate became the most frequent in 2014. PQ produced the highest rate of fatality followed by endosulfan. Although the frequency of PQ poisoning decreased, which may be attributed to governmental regulations, the CFR and incidence of pesticide poisoning in adults remain a public health concern that needs to be addressed.

AB Late-life depression is highly prevalent worldwide. In addition to being a debilitating illness, it is a risk factor for excess morbidity and mortality. Older adults with depression are at risk for dementia, coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer and suicide. Individuals with late-life depression often have significant medical comorbidity and, poor treatment adherence. Furthermore, psychosocial considerations such as gender, ethnicity, stigma and bereavement are necessary to understand the full context of late-life depression.
   The fact that most older adults seek treatment for depression in primary care settings led to the development of collaborative care interventions for depression. These interventions have consistently demonstrated clinically meaningful effectiveness in the treatment of late-life depression. We describe three pivotal studies detailing the management of depression in primary care settings in both high and low-income countries. Beyond effectively treating depression, collaborative care models address additional challenges associated with late-life depression. Although depression treatment interventions are effective compared to usual care, they exhibit relatively low remission rates and small to medium effect sizes.
   Several studies have demonstrated that depression prevention is possible and most effective in at-risk older adults. Given the relatively modest effects of treatment in averting years lived with disability, preventing late-life depression at the primary care level should be highly prioritized as a matter of health policy.

AB Background: The aim of this study was to compare inequalities in mortality (all causes and by cause) by occupational group and educational level between men and women living in France in the 1990s.
   Methods: Data were analysed from a permanent demographic sample currently including about one million people. The French Institute of Statistics (INSEE) follows the subjects and collects demographic, social and occupational information from the census schedules and vital status forms. Causes of death were obtained from the national file of the French Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM). A relative index of inequality (RII) was calculated to quantify inequalities as a function of educational level and occupational group. Overall all-cause mortality, mortality due to cancer, mortality due to cardiovascular disease and mortality due to external causes (accident, suicide, violence) were considered.
   Results: Overall, social inequalities were found to be wider among men than among women, for all-cause mortality, cancer mortality and external-cause mortality. However, this trend was not observed for cardiovascular mortality, for which the social inequalities were greater for women than for men, particularly for mortality due to ischaemic cardiac diseases.
   Conclusions: This study provides evidence for persistent social inequalities in mortality in France, in both men and women. These findings highlight the need for greater attention to social determinants of health. The reduction of cardiovascular disease mortality in low educational level groups should be treated as a major public health priority.

AB Background: Acetaminophen overdose (AO) is the most common cause of acute liver failure. We examined temporal trends and sociodemographic risk factors for AO in a large Canadian health region.
   Methods: 1,543 patients hospitalized for AO in the Calgary Health Region ( population similar to 1.1 million) between 1995 and 2004 were identified using administrative data.
   Results: The age/sex-adjusted hospitalization rate decreased by 41% from 19.6 per 100,000 population in 1995 to 12.1 per 100,000 in 2004 ( P < 0.0005). This decline was greater in females than males (46% vs. 29%). Whereas rates fell 46% in individuals under 50 years, a 50% increase was seen in those >= 50 years. Hospitalization rates for intentional overdoses fell from 16.6 per 100,000 in 1995 to 8.6 per 100,000 in 2004 (2004 vs. 1995: rate ratio [RR] 0.49; P < 0.0005). Accidental overdoses decreased between 1995 and 2002, but increased to above baseline levels by 2004 (2004 vs. 1995: RR 1.24; P < 0.0005). Risk factors for AO included female sex (RR 2.19; P < 0.0005), Aboriginal status ( RR 4.04; P < 0.0005), and receipt of social assistance (RR 5.15; P < 0.0005).
   Conclusion: Hospitalization rates for AO, particularly intentional ingestions, have fallen in our Canadian health region between 1995 and 2004. Young patients, especially females, Aboriginals, and recipients of social assistance, are at highest risk.

AB Background: Chinese patients with depression have limited access to mental health specialty care because of myriad barriers at different levels. Recently, there has been increased interest in targeting primary care settings for managing depression, because most depressed individuals visit their primary care physicians (PCPs) during the course of their depressive episodes. The present study examined PCPs' perceived barriers on the management of depression.
   Methods: A total of 295 PCPs completed a 36-item survey by mail. The survey questions included demographics, years in primary care, mental health training experience, and perceived barriers regarding the management of depression in their clinical and current practices. Chi-square and t-test analyses were used to compare the difference of demographic variables between the two districts. For the correlates of PCPs' clinical practices and their perceived barriers, logistic regression models were used.
   Results: At the practice level, lack of access to mental health specialists (37.8%) was the most commonly reported barrier and at patients' level, reluctance toward diagnosis of depression (34.6%) was the high barrier. Results have indicated that most PCPs (69.2%) felt comfortable discussing psychological issues with patients. Mental health training is significantly related to PCPs' clinical practice. When PCPs perceived moderate to high-level practice level barriers, prescription and referral were mostly preferred.
   Conclusion: PCPs in China perceived some barriers in the management of depression, but they were open to modifications and enhancement of their skills related to managing depression.

AB The objective was to examine gender differences in causes of death using the San Francisco HIV/AIDS and death registries. Data from San Francisco residents diagnosed with HIV/AIDS who died from 1996 to 2013 were analyzed. Age, race/ethnicity, year, and gender-adjusted standardized mortality ratios and Poisson 95% confidence intervals were calculated for underlying causes of death. Among the 6268 deaths, deaths attributed to drug use, mental disorders due to substance use, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal disease, and septicemia were more likely among women than among men. Compared to the California population, women had elevated standardized mortality ratios for drug overdose (25.37), mental disorders due to substance abuse (27.21), cerebrovascular disease (2.83), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (7.37), heart disease (2.37), and liver disease (5.54), and these were higher than the standardized mortality ratios for the men in our study. Men, but not women, had elevated standardized mortality ratios for suicide (2.70), undetermined intent (3.88), renal disease (2.29), and non-AIDS cancer (1.68) compared to population rates. Continued efforts to reduce HIV-related illnesses and an increased emphasis on diagnosing and treating preventable causes of death, including substance use, heart disease, and mental health disorders, are needed as part of comprehensive HIV care.

AB Introduction: This study was conducted to examine the characteristics of intentional fall injuries and the factors associated with their prognosis.
   Methods: The study included 8992 patients with unintentional falls from a height (nonintentional group) and 144 patients with intentional falls from a height (intentional group). General and clinical characteristics were compared between the 2 groups. Intentional fall cases were divided into severe and nonsevere groups, and the factors associated with severe injury were evaluated by comparing these groups.
   Results: The most common age group was younger than 14 years in the nonintentional group and between 30 and 44 years old in the intentional group. For the nonintentional group, 65% of the patients were male, and 48% were male in the intentional group. Fall heights of more than 4 m were most common in the intentional group. Discharge was the most common result in the nonintentional group; however, death before arrival at the emergency department (ED) or during ED treatment occurred in 54.9% of patients in the intentional group. In the severe injury group within the intentional group, patients were older, and the height of the fall was higher. Factors associated with severe injury in the intentional group included being a high school graduate rather than a college graduate and greater fall height.
   Conclusion: The risk of severe injury increased with fall height in the intentional group, and a high school level of education rather than a college level of education was associated with more severe injury. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective To describe poisoning hospitalisations among reproductive-aged women from 1998 to 2006.
   Methods 1998-2006 data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample of the Healthcare Cost and Utilisation Project were used to identify hospitalisations for poisonings among US women aged 15-44 years. Differences in hospitalisation characteristics were compared by intent using chi(2) statistics. Trends in poisoning hospitalisation rates were calculated overall and by subgroup.
   Results There were approximately 636 000 poisoning hospitalisations in women aged 15-44 years during 1998-2006. Hospitalisations for intentionally self-inflicted poisonings had a higher proportion of women aged 15-24 years and privately insured women than did unintentional poisonings (p<0.001). Poisoning hospitalisations in rural areas and those that resulted in death were more likely to be of undetermined intent than those for which intent was specified (p<0.001). Co-diagnoses of substance abuse (34.5%) or mental disorders (66.5%) were high. The rate of poisoning hospitalisations overall and unintentional poisoning hospitalisations increased 6% and 22%, respectively, during this period (p<0.001). The most frequently diagnosed poisoning agent was acetaminophen. Poisonings attributable to acetaminophen, opioids, central nervous system stimulants and benzodiazepines increased, while poisonings attributable to antidepressants decreased (p<0.05).
   Conclusions The increase in unintentional poisoning hospitalisations among women aged 15-44 years and the changing profile of poisoning agents should inform the healthcare community's poisoning prevention strategies. Poisoning prevention strategies should include a component to address substance abuse and mental health disorders among reproductive-age women.

AB Mental health screening and assessment is crucial within juvenile correctional facilities (JC). However, limited information is available about the current screening and assessment procedures specifically within JC.
   The purpose of the current study was to obtain information about the mental health screening and assessment procedures used in JC throughout the United States.
   Ninety-four clinical staff members (one from each JC) completed a survey about the mental health screening and assessment procedures conducted at their facilities. We used descriptive statistics to obtain prevalence data about (a) who is screened and assessed, (b) frequency of screening and assessment, (c) methods used and areas screened and assessed, (d) qualifications of those conducting screenings and assessments, and (e) perceived adequacy of screening procedures.
   Ninety-eight percent (n = 92) of participants reported that their facilities conducted suicide risk screenings, and 97% (n = 90) reported that mental health screenings were conducted at admission for all youth. Additionally, 59 (63%) respondents reported that all youth receive an extensive assessment of mental health concerns. However, only forty-six percent (n = 42) of the 92 participants responding indicated repeated screening of youth throughout their stay, and only 46% (n = 34) of the 74 participants responding indicated screening at discharge. Additionally, a variety of assessments were reportedly used and there was little consistency across JC.
   The findings revealed a continued need for consistent policies and procedures across facilities regarding screening and assessment to address various screening and assessment issues and promote quality care.

   near misses; preventable deaths; safety
AB Introduction The reported 90-day rate of death from living donor nephrectomy is 3 in 10,000 donations. Although this risk is low, the important question is how many deaths are preventable? Methods To study this question, all living donor nephrectomy cases, 139,186 procedures, recorded in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database since its inception in 1987 were analyzed to determine the death rate and the number of deaths that were potentially preventable. Preventable deaths were defined as any death in the first 7 days except due to clearly unrelated events or death from hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism, infection, cardiovascular cause, or suicide in the first 90 days. Results The numbers of deaths at 7, 30, 90, and 365 days after donation were 16, 26, 38, and 86, which translated into 1.15, 1.87, 2.73, and 6.18 deaths per 10,000 donations, respectively. From 2000 onward, when coding was available for cause of death, 19 of the 30 deaths were deemed potentially preventable. The nonrisk-adjusted rate of death with laparoscopic donation was higher than open nephrectomy, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Conversion from laparoscopic to open nephrectomy occurs in approximately 1 in 100 surgeries, and this rate has remained fairly steady since 2005. Conclusions This analysis suggests that up to two thirds of deaths are potentially preventable. The transplant community should consider additional safety strategies such as simulation training of rare complications to lower donor risk.

AB Szmul Zygielbojm was a politician and a member of the Bund and its Central Committee as well as a councilman of Warsaw and Lodz. In 1940, he left occupied Poland and spent the rest of the war in exile - first in France and then in the United States of America. In 1942, he arrived in Great Britain, where he served as a representative of his party in the National Council of the Polish government in exile. For over a year he had devoted his energies to attempts to inform the world about the mass extermination of Jews. In May 1943, he committed suicide in protest against inaction of the free world in the face of the Shoah.
   In January 1940, as he departed Warsaw, Szmul Zygielbojm left behind his family: wife Mania, son Artur and a daughter from his first marriage, Rywka. Between 1940 and 1941, a separated family maintained correspondence. The presented letters (the letters presented above) were sent from Poland by Zygielbojm's wife and two children. Unfortunately, there exists only one letter from Zygielbojm to his wife, the rest are missing. This emotional correspondence shows the drama of the family, but also allows one to have a look at Zygielbojm's private life, thus complementing the politician's biography. The Zygielbojms' wartime correspondence is also an example of how letters can be an important source in the Holocaust research.

LA English
DT Article; Book Chapter
AB On October 31, 1999, EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, killing all 217 people on board. When loved ones were notified about the crash their first thoughts were almost exclusively about whether or not their loved ones might have survived. Later there was, and continues to be, controversy about the cause of the crash. Possible theories include pilot suicide, revenge, or mechanical error, and some Egyptians believe the plane was shot down by the United States. None of these theories were relevant when family members arrived at a hotel reception center close to JFK Airport in New York. Most were in shock. Responders, including mental health professionals, arrived on the scene to provide whatever support they could. Many Egyptian family members did not speak English, and one woman who had arrived early sat alone, crying. A Red Cross disaster mental health worker saw the woman, approached her, sat with her, held her hand, and brought her some water. She remained present with the survivor for over an hour until other family members arrived. When the volunteer went home she was upset about the tragedy, and she was also upset with herself for how little help she had been able to offer the survivor, as she could not speak Arabic. A few days later the volunteer got feedback from supervisors on the scene. They reported that the survivor told family members that, without the support of the volunteer, without her kindness, she did not think she could have endured. She said she would be eternally grateful for the help she received.

AB Objective: We examined the relationship between mental illness, health care utilization and rates of cholesterol testing.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using Veterans Affairs (VA) administrative data on 64,490 United States veterans who used VA New England Health Care System outpatient services between January 1998 and June 2001. A total of 10,100 veterans (15.7%) had a mental illness treated with medication. We examined the interaction between mental illness and outpatient service utilization with respect to the likelihood of receiving a cholesterol test, adjusting for major demographic and clinical covariates.
   Results: Among veterans using VA outpatient services infrequently, those with mental illness were less likely than non-mentally in control subjects to receive a cholesterol test during the study period (first quartile adjusted OR=0.45, 95% CI=0.37-0.54; second quartile adjusted OR=0.50, 95% CI=0.45-0.57). Mentally ill subjects with more frequent utilization of VA services were as likely as (third quartile adjusted OR=1.01, 95% CI=0.91-1.13) or more likely than (fourth quartile adjusted OR=2.73, 95% CI=2.46-3.03) non-mentally ill subjects to receive cholesterol testing.
   Conclusions: Mental illness was associated with a lower likelihood of cholesterol testing in subjects who used fewer VA outpatient services. The observed disparity attenuated at higher levels of service utilization. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Performing euthanasia services in animal shelters is a necessary function, yet one that can take a heavy toll on shelter staff. The aims of this exploratory study were to understand animal shelter management's perspective on staff reactions to euthanasia, to identify support programs and policies, and to understand the challenges and barriers to offering such services. A convenience sample of 54 shelter managers in the United States was surveyed using structured questionnaires. As expected, euthanasia was a common practice in shelters, averaging 869 dogs and cats annually per shelter. In response to performing euthanasia, sadness (83.3%), crying (68.5%), anger (57.4%), and depression (57.4%) were the most commonly reported staff reactions. Most shelter managers (74.0%) agreed that euthanasia contributed to burnout in staff, yet far fewer (26.0%) felt that euthanasia led to turnover. Shelter managers indicated that support programs were important for staff who perform euthanasia services. The most commonly offered support programs were training and education (offered in 48.1% of shelters), staff rotation (38.9%), informal peer support (38.9%), and breaks after euthanasia (35.1%). The vast majority of managers (74.0%) identified funding as the primary barrier to offering support programs. These findings confirm that performing euthanasia can have serious and problematic ramifications for shelter staff and shelter operations. While support programs are offered, they do not appear to be widespread or universal, primarily due to funding issues.

DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; CHILDREN; DEATHS; TRENDS; RATES
AB Background Childhood injuries are a major public health problem worldwide, injuries being the leading cause of death and disability from early childhood through adolescence.
   Objective To examine the 40-year nationwide trends in the number and incidence of fatal injuries among children aged 0-14 years in Finland, a country with a white European population of 5.3 million.
   Methods Data were obtained from the Official Cause-of-Death Statistics of Finland during 1971-2010. The main categories for unintentional injury deaths were road traffic injury, water traffic injury, falls, drowning and poisoning. For intentional injury deaths, the main categories were suicide and homicide.
   Results In 1971, there were 109 fatal injuries involving girls and 207 involving boys, and in 2010, these numbers were 10 and 16. The corresponding incidence rates (per 100 000 children per year) were 20.1 and 2.3 (girls), and 36.7 and 3.5 (boys). The reduction in fatal injuries was mostly due to fewer unintentional injuries. The greatest decline occurred in the number of fatal motor vehicle injuries: from 57 (girls) and 92 (boys) in 1971 to 5 (girls) and 2 (boys) in 2010. Drownings followed a similar pattern. Violence-related deaths also showed a decreasing trend. In 1971, there were 14 intentional deaths in girls and 15 in boys, while in 2010 these numbers were 0 and 3, respectively.
   Conclusions This nationwide study confirms a decline in childhood injury deaths over the last four decades, with the greatest declines occurring in the number of fatal motor vehicle injuries, drownings and intentional injuries.

AB Objectives: To assess quality of depression care during the high-risk period following a psychiatric hospitalization.
   Study Design: Retrospective administrative data analysis.
   Methods: Using Veterans Health Administration (VHA) administrative data, we assessed mental health follow-up within 7 and 30 days of psychiatric hospitalizations for major depression from 2004 to 2008. Adequate antidepressant medication coverage and number of psychotherapy visits were assessed within 90 days of discharge. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify patient demographic and clinical characteristics associated with each quality indicator.
   Results: Of the 45,587 patients discharged from a psychiatric inpatient stay with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, 39.4% and 75.8% received an outpatient visit within 7 and 30 days of discharge, respectively; 58.7% of patients received adequate antidepressant coverage (72 of 90 days) and 12.9% received adequate psychotherapy encounters (8 visits). Receipt of outpatient mental health visits and of adequate psychotherapy were less likely among patients who were male, aged <35 or >65 years, had >3 major general medical comorbidities, lived >30 miles from a VHA clinic, or whose hospital length of stay was <7 days. Patients with comorbid substance use disorders were less likely to receive adequate antidepressant treatment.
   Conclusions: To optimize evidence-based depression care after a psychiatric hospitalization, health systems might increase receipt of psychotherapy by considering potential barriers related to age, medical condition, and distance. Patients with comorbid substance use disorders or their providers may need additional services to support antidepressant treatment. (Am J Manag Care. 2011; 17(9): e358-e364)

AB A high disease burden of mental disorders has been noted worldwide, including Japan. It is important to monitor mental disorder prevalence trends and the use of mental health services over time using epidemiological data and to plan appropriate policies and measures that consider mental health in each country. This review outlines the prevalence trends of common mental disorders (CMD) and the use of mental health services in Japan from the 2000s to the 2010s and compares them with those in other countries. This review clarifies that the prevalence of CMD in Japan has been relatively stable in the past decade. The 12-month prevalence of mental health service use has increased about 1.2 times to 1.6 times in the past 10-15 years. Thus, it is very likely that the rise in mental health service use contributes to increased patient numbers. Regarding cross-national comparison, the prevalence rate of CMD in Japan is much lower compared to rates in the USA and Europe. The 12-month prevalence of mental health service use was also lower in Japan compared to prevalence rates in other high-income countries. Mental health epidemiology has clarified that the prevalence of CMD worldwide has remained unchanged, even though mental health service use has increased in high-income countries. Thus, the gap in treatment quality and prevention should be addressed in the future.

AB To date, the association between the alcohol sale status of decedents' residence and alcohol-related homicide victimization have not been studied as far as we know. The current study aims to: i) determine whether homicide victims who were residents of wet counties had higher odds of testing positive for alcohol than their counterparts in moist or dry counties after adjusting for confounders; ii) determine whether homicides and alcohol-related homicides tend to cluster spatially; iii) determine whether the aforementioned associations exist only in highly-populated counties. A multilevel logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the data on homicide victims in the Kentucky Violent Death Reporting System from 2005 to 2012. Spatial statistics were used to determine the spatial autocorrelation in rates of homicides and alcohol-related homicides. Overall. 944 homicide victims were included. The male to female ratio was 3:1. About 32.8% of homicide victims tested positive for alcohol. About 33.0% of homicide decedents who were residents in wet counties tested positive for alcohol compared to 32.5% of their counterparts in moist/dry counties. Residence in wet counties was associated with a statistically insignificant increase in the unadjusted odds ratio (OR) of alcohol-related homicide victimization (OR=1.20, 95% CI=0.81-1.77) as well as the adjusted odds (aOR=1.33, 95% CI=0.83-2.12). There was no association between population size and alcohol-related homicide rate.

AB Bipolar disorder has been considered to have a better prognosis than schizophrenia at the very beginning of its definition. However, psychosocial functioning may vary not only because of the characteristics of the disorder, but also of co-morbid conditions, especially regarding substance use disorder (SUD). The purpose of this study was to compare the social adjustment level of patients with bipolar disorder with that observed in patients with schizophrenia, taking into account substance use disorder (SUD). Forty subjects with schizophrenia and 40 subjects with bipolar disorder, in the stable phase of the disorder, were matched for age, gender and presence of SUD (DSM-IV criteria). The social adjustment scale was completed with socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of illness. The global adaptation score of bipolar patients with SUD was poorer than bipolar patients without SUD, but was not observed as being significantly different from that of patients with schizophrenia, with or without associated SUD. Suicide attempts, poor compliance. longer hospitalisation, shorter remissions and criminal activity were also more frequently observed in the group of patients with bipolar disorder and SUD. Presence of substance use disorder seems to have a greater weight than the main diagnostic (schizophrenia versus bipolar disorder) to predict worse social adjustment and poorer outcome.

AB The growing support for voluntary active euthanasia (VAE) is evident in the recently approved Dutch Law on Termination of Life on Request. Indeed, the debate over legalized VAE has increased in European countries, the United States, and many other nations over the last several years. The proponents of VAE argue that when a patient judges that the burdens of living outweigh the benefits, euthanasia can be justified. If some adults suffer to such an extent that VAE is justified, then one may conclude that some children suffer to this extent as well. In an attempt to alleviate the suffering of extremely ill neonates, the University Medical Center Groningen developed a protocol for neonatal euthanasia. In this article, I first present the ethical justifications for VAE and discuss how these arguments relate to euthanizing ill neonates. I then argue that, even if one accepts the justification for VAE in adults, neonatal euthanasia cannot be supported, primarily because physicians and parents can never accurately assess the suffering of children. I then argue that without the testament of the patient herself as to the nature and magnitude of her suffering, physicians can never accurately weigh the benefits and burdens of a child's life, and therefore any such system would condemn to death some children whose suffering is not unbearable. I conclude that because the primary duty of physicians is to never harm their patients, neonatal euthanasia cannot be supported.

AB Background: Clinical trial data provide an approach to the investigation of the effects of psychopharmacological agents, and psychiatric disorders themselves, on seizure threshold.
   Methods: We accessed public domain data from Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Phase II and III clinical trials as Summary Basis of Approval (SBA) reports that noted seizure incidence in trials of psychotropic drugs approved in the United States between 1985 and 2004, involving a total of 75,873 patients. We compared seizure incidence among active drug and placebo groups in psychopharmacological clinical trials and the published rates of unprovoked seizures in the general population.
   Results: Increased seizure incidence was observed with antipsychotics that was accounted for by clozapine and olanzapine, and with drugs indicated for the treatment of OCD that was accounted for by clomipramine. Alprazolam, bupropion immediate release (IR) form, and quetiapine were also associated with higher seizure incidence. The incidence of seizures was significantly lower among patients assigned to antidepressants compared to placebo (standardized incidence ratio = .48; 95% Cl, .36-.61). In patients assigned to placebo, seizure incidence was greater than the published incidence of unprovoked seizures in community nonpatient samples.
   Conclusions: Proconvulsant effects are associated with a subgroup of psychotropic drugs. Second-generation antidepressants other than bupropion have an apparent anticonvulsant effect. Depression, psychotic disorders, and OCD are associated with reduced seizure threshold.

TI Content analyses of oaths administered at US medical schools in 2000
SO ACADEMIC MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Purpose. Oath taking is an important aspect of professionalization that all physicians share. The authors conducted a content analysis of the medical oaths administered at all allopathic and osteopathic medical schools in the United States to evaluate variations in ethical content.
   Method. The authors collected medical oaths administered at all accredited allopathic and osteopathic medical schools (122 and 19, respectively) in the year 2000. Using a modified conceptual framework developed by Baker, the oaths were analyzed for differences in their substantive content. Content differences based on schools' characteristics were also analyzed.
   Results. Just over half (62 of 122) of the allopathic schools administered an oath other than the Hippocratic Oath or a modified version of it. Thirty allopathic schools administered an oath written by students and/or faculty, and 18 schools offered students more than one oath option. All 19 osteopathic schools used the Osteopathic Oath. Nearly all allopathic and osteopathic schools' oaths included content protecting patients' confidentiality (129 schools), but few cited the importance of avoiding sexual misconduct with patients (four schools). Although the Osteopathic Oath prohibits physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia, only six allopathic schools administered an oath with such a prohibition. One allopathic school's oath explicitly prohibited abortion. There were no major content differences in the oaths administered based on a school's ownership status, religious affiliation, or use of white coat ceremony.
   Conclusion. Many medical schools' oaths differ in substantive content. The impact of using a nonstandardized medical oath on physicians' professionalism and the inculcation of common ethical values and principles remains unknown.

ID PREGNANCY-RELATED MORTALITY; UNITED-STATES; FINLAND; WOMEN
AB Background: The magnitude of maternal mortality is underestimated as deaths occurring beyond the traditional 42-day time period after the pregnancy ending ('late death') have not been reported routinely in Australia.
   Aims: The aims of this study were to undertake a data linkage study to improve the ascertainment of maternal deaths and to determine the number of deaths occurring 43-365 days after the pregnancy ended ('late maternal death').
   Methods: Data from the New South Wales Midwives Data Collection were linked with the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare National Death Index. Australian identified pregnancy-related deaths were then coded as direct, indirect and incidental to the pregnancy.
   Results: During the period 1994-2001, 173 maternal deaths were identified. Of these, 97 were classified as occurring up to 42 days of the pregnancy ending, 15 (15.5%) of which were previously unknown to the maternal mortality committee. In addition, 76 deaths were classified as occurring between 43 and 365 days after the pregnancy ended. The majority (70 of 76) of these late deaths were only identified through the linkage study. Most (73 of 76) of these deaths were classified as indirect maternal deaths with the most common causes of deaths suicide (n = 23), cardiac disorders (n = 16) or accident/violence (n = 16).
   Conclusions: The ascertainment of maternal and late maternal mortality was enhanced through data linkage of birth and mortality data. Data linkage is a viable method for monitoring late maternal deaths.

ID RISK BEHAVIOR SURVEILLANCE; DRUG-USE; YOUTH; SCHOOL; STUDENTS; POLICY
AB Purpose: To: (a) establish criteria for defining positive health behaviors and lifestyle; and (b) identify characteristics of adolescents who practice a healthy lifestyle.
   Methods: Responses from a 1998 survey via questionnaire, of 1487 students, from a public high school, Cambridge, Massachusetts, were used to assess correlates of healthy lifestyle choices. Strict and broad assessments of healthy behaviors were defined for students: use of alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs; sexual behavior, attempted suicide. Whereas the "strict" criteria included only those adolescents who did not practice any of the behaviors in question, the broad criteria reflected experimentation and moderate risk-taking. The prevalence of positive behaviors was assessed by demographic and student characteristics. In addition, logistic regression models were created to predict determinants of teenagers' healthy lifestyles using both strict and broad definitions.
   Results: Using strict criteria of healthy lifestyle, significant predictors were being female, born outside the United States, higher academic performance, and fewer stressful life events. Using a broad definition of a healthy lifestyle, significant predictors were being non-Caucasian, in the lower grade levels at the school, higher acaademic performance, and fewer stressful life events. In both models, peers' approval of risky behaviours negatively influenced teens' lifestyles, whereas parents' disapproval of risky behaviors was a positive influence.
   Conclusions: These results reinforce the importance of school, peer, and parent support of positive behaviors. It is important for public health workers and families to understand and define healthy lifestyles choices for adolescents. (C) Society for Adolescent Medicine, 2004.

AB Background: A growing body of research has examined transgender identity development, but no studies have investigated developmental pathways as a transactional process between youth and caregivers, incorporating perspectives from multiple family members. The aim of this study was to conceptualize pathways of transgender identity development using narratives from both transgender and gender-nonconforming (TGN) youth and their cisgender (nontransgender) caregivers.
   Methods: The sample included 16 families, with 16 TGN youth, ages 7 to 18 years, and 29 cisgender caregivers (n = 45 family members). TGN youth represented multiple gender identities, including trans boy (n = 9), trans girl (n = 5), gender-fluid boy (n = 1), and girlish boy (n = 1). Caregivers included mothers (n = 17), fathers (n = 11), and one grandmother. Participants were recruited from LGBTQ community organizations and support networks for families with transgender youth in the Midwest, Northeast, and South regions of the United States. Each family member completed a one-time, in-person semistructured qualitative interview that included questions about transgender identity development.
   Results: Analyses revealed seven overarching themes of transgender identity development, which were organized into a conceptual model: Trans identity development, sociocultural influences/societal discourse, biological influences, family adjustment/impact, stigma/cisnormativity, support/resources, and gender affirmation/actualization.
   Conclusions: Findings underscore the importance of assessing developmental processes among TGN youth as transactional, impacting both youth and their caregivers.

AB Objective Korean American Elderly (KAE) have high rates of depression but underuse mental health services. The purpose of this study was to assess the meaning of depression and help seeking among KAE residing in the United States who have clinically significant depressive symptoms.
   Methods As a follow up to the Memory and Aging Study of Koreans (MASK; n=1,118), a descriptive epidemiological study which showed that only one in four of KAE with clinically significant depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 >= 10) used mental health services, we conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with participants with clinically significant depressive symptoms regarding the meaning of depression and beliefs about help seeking. Ten participants with clinically significant depressive symptoms were approached and 8 were recruited for semi-structured interviews.
   Results KAE did not identify themselves as depressed though experiencing clinically significant depressive symptoms. They associated depression with social discrimination, social isolation, and suicide in the extreme circumstance. They attributed depression to not achieving social and material success in America and strained relationships with their children. Participants attempted to self-manage distress without telling others in their social network. However, KAE were willing to consult with mental health professionals if the services were bilingual, affordable, and confidential.
   Conclusion KAE with clinically significant depressive symptoms are a vulnerable group with need and desire for linguistically and culturally relevant mental health services who are isolated due to a complex array of psychological and social factors.

AB Data from two fixed-dose studies of sertraline in panic disorder were pooled in order to provide sufficient power for the analysis of treatment response in clinically relevant subgroups. Male and non-fertile female patients meeting DSR I-LII-R criteria for moderate-to-severe panic disorder with or without agoraphobia completed a 1-2 week placebo run-in period, and then mere randomized to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with either placebo, or one of three fixed daily doses of sertraline (50 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg). Eighty-two patients were treated with placebo and 240 patients were treated with one of three doses of sertraline. All three sertraline doses produced significant efficacy compared to placebo, with no consistent evidence of a dose-response effect. For the subset of patients with subsyndromic depression at baseline [baseline Hamilton Depression Rating scale (HAM-D > 12 and less than or equal to 21], sertraline yielded a significantly higher panic-free rate than did placebo (P = 0.021), again, by a conservative endpoint (Last observation Carried Forward method, LOCF) analysis. Sertraline was well-tolerated at all dose levels, with no significant between-dose differences in patients discontinuing due to adverse events. The presence of mild-to-moderate subsyndromic levels of depression did not reduce the anti-panic efficacy of sertraline. (C) 2000 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

TI Forgiveness, spirituality and love: thematic analysis of last statements
   from Death Row, Texas (2002-17)
SO QJM-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICINE
LA English

ID UNITED-STATES; SUICIDE; INMATES; EXECUTION; WORDS
AB Background: Psychological features associated with execution are not fully understood.
   Aims: To analyse demographics of individuals executed in Texas and investigate whether there has been any change in common themes and psychological factors evident in last statements before execution between 2002 and 2017.
   Design: Analysis of last statements from Death Row, Texas.
   Methods: We (a) studied themes and psychological factors in last statements in Texas between August 2011 and May 2017; and (b) combined our 2011-17 data with our previous data (2002-06 and 2006-11) to present an overall analysis of last statements from 2002 to 2017.
   Results: Between April 2002 and May 2017 (279 executions; 240 last statements), the execution rate in Texas fell from 25 per year to 12; median time on death row increased from 108.5 months to 149.5; median age at execution increased from 38 years to 40.5; and the proportion of offences involving multiple victims rose from 28.4% to 47.1%. The most common themes in last statements were love (78%), spirituality (58%), regret (35%) and apology (35%). The most common psychological factors were identification-egression (51%), unbearable psychological pain (47%) and rejection-aggression (40%). Two themes (forgiveness, use of poetry/literature) and three psychological factors (inability to adjust, interpersonal relations, identification-egression) became less common.
   Conclusions: Between 2002 and 2017, executed prisoners in Texas became fewer and older, spent longer on death row and had committed more serious offences. Themes of love and spirituality were constants, but requests for forgiveness declined.

AB On March 31, 2005, Terri Schiavo (born December 3, 1963) died - the final complication of a cardiac arrest on February 25, 1990. Her death was preceded by the withdrawal of artificially administered hydration and nutrition through a feeding tube. Prior to her death, Terri's saga was the focus of intense medical, ethical, and legal debates in the United States (US) and elsewhere. These debates were characterized by confusion about the facts, ethical principles, and laws relevant to the case. Much of the confusion revolved around a number of ethical and legal questions including: Is it ethically and legally permissible to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatments from patients who do not want the treatments? Is withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatments the same as physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia? Is artificially administered hydration and nutrition a medical treatment or mandatory care akin to bathing? What were Terri's values, preferences, and goals regarding life-sustaining treatments? In this article, the medical, ethical, and legal data related to the case and the aforementioned ethical and legal questions raised by it are reviewed. Finally, the clinical implications of the saga, such as the need for clinicians to be more proactive in educating patients about their rights related to making health care decisions, end-of-life care options, and advance care planning (e.g., completing an advance directive) are discussed. Notably, given that the Schiavo saga occurred in the US, this article is written from a US perspective.

AB When a U.S. Navy Aircraft Carrier battle group deploys overseas, the aircraft carrier's medical department is responsible for the medical needs of over 12,000 personnel with their indigenous developmental, stress, family, alcohol, drug, and interpersonal and intrapersonal relationship difficulties. This article reviews the effectiveness of having a U.S. Navy clinical psychologist and a psychiatric technician onboard the USS Carl Vinson, the flag ship of Vinson's battle group, during this battle group's 1998/1999 Persian Gulf deployment (i.e., Western Pacific Deployment). Importantly, these two individuals reported to the USS Vinson as permanent members of the ship's company. The clinical psychologist logged 448 individual outpatient-care consults and 79 individual consults with sailors who had a history of overusing or abusing alcohol. Additionally, nine sailors with acute disabling psychiatric diagnoses were hospitalized on the ship's medical ward, and four sailors were medically evacuated (medevaced), by fixed wing aircraft, from USS Vinson to a Navy Hospital in the United States for definitive evaluation, treatment, and disposition. These four medevacs were less than the number of medevacs from two previous Aircraft Carrier Battle Group Persian Gulf deployments. Importantly, these two previous WESTPAC deployments were made without having a clinical psychologist as a full-time member of the respective aircraft carrier's medical department. Providing clinical psychology/mental health services at the "tip of the spear" is an effective, beneficial, and cost-saving landmark improvement in providing quality medical care to the fleet.

AB Background/Purpose: The seroincidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Taiwan has drastically increased since 2004, particularly among injection drug users and prisoners. The major purpose of this study was to explore the prevalence and correlates of psychiatric morbidity among HIV-infected male prisoners.
   Methods: In 2006, data were collected from all of HIV-infected male prisoners (n=535) in seven prisons in Taiwan. This collection was performed using a self-administered, anonymous questionnaire in group settings directed by our interviewers. Psychiatric morbidity was measured using the five-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale in 535 participants, which represented an 85% response rate. After excluding incomplete data, 479 participants were included in the analysis.
   Results: Psychiatric morbidity was present in 46% of participants. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that correlates of the five-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale defined cases included the following: being a recidivist, having poor self-rated health status, and having experienced psychiatric symptoms in one's lifetime (e.g. significant physical pain or discomfort, depression for 2 weeks or longer, serious anxiety or tension, trouble understanding, concentrating, or remembering, and serious thoughts of suicide), with a Nagelkerke R-2 equal to 0.365.
   Conclusion: Psychiatric morbidity is prevalent among HIV-infected male prisoners. Tailored HIV/AIDS education related to mental health is therefore suggested for inclusion as part of a comprehensive HIV/AIDS training program among incarcerated populations.

AB Background: Social anxiety disorder, which occurs in 2% to 5% of children and adolescents, is associated with significant distress and functional impairment.
   Methods: The objective of the randomized, masked controlled trial conducted in 48 academic and community centers in the United States was to evaluate the efficacy of venlafaxine ER in children and adolescents with generalized social anxiety disorder. A volunteer sample of 293 outpatients, age 8 to 17, who met diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder and were enrolled between February 2000 and March 2003 participated. Venlafaxine ER or placebo was titrated from a starting dose of 37.5 mg to a maximum dose of 225 mg over 16 weeks. The primary dependent measures were the Social Anxiety Scale, child or adolescent version (SAS-CA) and for responder analysis, a (dichotomized) Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) score.
   Results: Compared with placebo, intent-to-treat random regression analyses indicated a statistically significant advantage for venlafaxine ER (p = .001) on the SAS-CA. On the CGI-I responder analysis, 56% (95% confidence interval [CI], 47%-64%) of venlafaxine ER treated subjects responded, which was statistically superior to placebo (37% [95% CI, 29%-45%]). Three venlafaxine ER and no placebo patients developed treatment-emergent suicidality; there were no completed suicides.
   Conclusions: Venlafaxine ER is an effective and reasonably well-tolerated treatment for generalized social anxiety disorder in children and adolescents. As with other antidepressants, careful clinical monitoring for adverse events, including treatment-emergent suicidality, is essential.

AB Aims To examine whether, and why, farmers and non-farmers differ regarding levels of anxiety and depression.
   Methods The study encompassed 17 295 workers age 40-49 years, including 917 farmers, from the population-based Hordaland Health Study 1997-99 (HUSK). Levels of anxiety and depression were assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A and HADS-D, respectively). Self-reported information on various work-related factors, demographics, lifestyle and somatic health problems was included. The main analytical methods were univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) /Kruskal-Wallis test, chi(2) /Fisher's exact test and logistic regression.
   Results Compared with non-farmers, farmers had higher levels and prevalences of depression, particularly the male farmers, who also had higher anxiety levels. Among men, farmers reported longer work hours, lower income, higher psychological job demands and less decision latitude compared with non-farmers. Farmers had physically heavier work and a lower level of education than non-farmers. Generally, the differences were largest between full-time farmers and non-farmers. Differences in anxiety and depression levels between male full-time farmers and non-farmers could be explained by the farmers' longer work hours, physically harder work and lower income.
   Conclusions Farming is associated with increased levels of anxiety and increased levels and prevalences of depression. As regards depression, preventative measures and screening for cases in need of treatment should be strongly considered.

AB Objectives: The objective of this study is to estimate the proportion of different types of end-of-life decisions (ELDs) of physicians in the city of Hasselt (Flanders, Belgium), The question is addressed to what degree these ELD meet legal constraints and the ethical requirements for prudent practice.
   Methodology: All physicians of the city of Hasselt who signed at least one death certificate in 1996 (N = 166) received an anonymous self-administered mail questionnaire per death case (max. 5/doctor).
   Results: the response rate was 55% (N = 269). rn 37.3% of all cases at least one ELD was made (16.5% non-treatment decisions; 16% potential life-shortening by intensifying the treatment of pain and symptoms; 4.8% administration, supply or prescription of lethal drugs). In 59.5% of the cases were an ELD was made that decision was legally questionable. Patient characteristics were clearly related to the type of ELD There was no influence of physician characteristics, except for commitment to life-stance, In 71.3 % of the cases the ELD was in no way discussed with the patient, 8.1 % of the ELD-cases were in response to a direct request from the patient.
   Conclusions: The incidences of ELDs in Hasselt are consistent with earlier findings. The study shows that religious commitment influences the behaviour of physicians at the end of their patients' life. The patient's and her family's entitlements to participation in the decision making process were rather poorly respected.

TI Pilot Study of Reproductive Health Counseling in a Pediatric
   Rheumatology Clinic
SO ARTHRITIS CARE & RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES
AB ObjectiveTo assess perception and behavior after reproductive health counseling among adolescent patients in a tertiary care-based pediatric rheumatology clinic.
   MethodsAdolescent females seen at a Stanford pediatric rheumatology clinic were prospectively enrolled during routine visits. At the study start, standard clinic procedures were reviewed with providers for the following: 1) the home, education, activities, drugs, sexual activity, and suicide/depression (HEADSS) assessment; 2) reproductive health counseling; and 3) medical record documentation. Patients were enrolled if providers indicated that they performed the HEADSS assessment and reproductive health counseling. At enrollment, patients completed a survey to assess their perceptions of reproductive health counseling. Chart reviews confirmed documented discussions. A followup survey performed 3-5 months after enrollment tracked reproductive health information-seeking behavior.
   ResultsIn total, 90 females (mean SD age 17 +/- 2 years) participated. Almost all patients (99%) agreed that reproductive health was discussed; 71% reported that pregnancy risks were discussed, 42% had recent concerns about reproductive health, and 33% reported their provider recommended that they seek further reproductive health care. Eighty-four patients completed followup phone surveys, with 25% reporting seeking further information on reproductive health concerns, but with only 9.5% actually seeking further care. Only 18% of patients reported having ever asked their rheumatology provider for guidance regarding reproductive health care concerns.
   ConclusionRoutine reproductive health discussion and counseling are necessary in a rheumatology clinic because, in our experience, a substantial number of adolescents have concerns and actively seek reproductive health information. Despite these discussions, adolescents rarely pursue further reproductive health care. Further work to bridge this gap is needed.

TI Factor validity of a scale to assess violence towards women in a Mexican
   national sample.
SO SALUD MENTAL

DT Article
DE marital violence; factor validity; Mexico
ID DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; PREVALENCE; RISK
AB Studies carried out all over the world have pointed marital violence as a main public health issue. Nlost of such studies also show that women have several disadvantages when compared to males, for instance. in the United States the risk of partner homicide is 8 times higher for females than for males, and the risk for being injured by an armed partner is 7 times higher.
   In Mexico, epidemiological research of family violence is still incipient. One of the first epidemiological studies was developed in the Southern area Of Mexico City, the findings showed that around 38% of the women interviewed had been subjected to both physical and emotional violence at least once in their lifetime.
   On the other hand, 37% of the women attending public health care institutions had suffered some form of violence at least once during their lives while 21.6% had been abused by their partner during the previous year. The group more likely to suffer violence was between 31 and 45 Years and had low schooling. According to the Health Ministry the State with the highest prevalence of violence was Quintana Roo, and Aguascalientes had the lowest.
   The study of violence and its different manifestations often implies a significant rate of under registration, a fact due to its hidden nature. Thus, it is necessary to develop valid instruments to periodically assess this phenomenon in a reliable wand Therefore, the objective of the present paper is to present the factor validity of a scale aimed at assessing violence towards women in general population.
   Data were gathered in the Third National Survey on Addictions, which included an adapted version of the violence assessment scale. It was administered to urban women aged between 18 and 65 years, currently living with a partner, or who have once lived in couple. Different violent acts were explored as whether them, occurred once. in a lifetime or during the last year. The sample design was probabilistic, stratified, clustered and multi-stage, it was based upon the Basic Geostatistical Areas and the National Population Counting 1995. Interviewers were instructed regarding the specific requirements to hold an interview and to warrant the confidentiality of information. An exploratory factor analysis was performed with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows V10 using principal components method and varimax rotation. The resulting factors were analyzed according to sociodemographic variables; differences were verified through X-2 tests. The prevalence of both resulting factors was also obtained.
   The twelve items of the scale were grouped into two factors that altogether explain 52% of the total variance. The first factor was called physical and verbal volence because it includes acts that involve hearing, shouting at, and threatening women. The second factor was named threats of suicide and death. Finally a confirmatory factor analyses was performed (EQS for Windows V.6). The internal consistency coefficient was 0.86 for the physical and verbal violence factor and 0.68 for threats of death and suicide.
   The presence of physical and verbal violence was significantly higher among women with less schooling and lower income, separated or divorced, non-religious and who also reported domestic violence in their family of origin. Separated and divorced women, as well as women with family history of violence also had more threats of suicide and death.
   The main contribution of the present paper is the scale used to assess situations where emotional and physical violence towards women is involved. It is important that these data contribute to policy making to protect children and facilitate special support to women and their aggressors.

AB Objectives Comorbidity is a common feature of mental disorders. However, needs assessment surveys focus largely on individual disorders rather than on comorbidity even though the latter is more important for predicting suicidal thoughts and behaviors. In the current report, we take a step beyond this conventional approach by presenting data on the prevalence and correlates (sociodemographic factors, college-related factors, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors) of the main multivariate profiles of common comorbid Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV disorders among students participating in the first phase of the World Health Organization World Mental Health International College Student initiative. Method A web-based mental health survey was administered to first year students in 19 colleges across eight countries (Australia, Belgium, Germany, Mexico, Northern Ireland, South Africa, Spain, United States; 45.5% pooled response rate) to screen for seven common DSM-IV mental disorders: major depression, mania/hypomania, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, alcohol use disorder, and drug use disorder. We focus on the 14,348 respondents who provided complete data; 38.4% screened positive for at least one 12-month disorder. Results Multivariate disorder profiles were detected using latent class analysis (LCA). The least common class (C1; 1.9% of students) was made up of students with high comorbidity (four or more disorders, the majority including mania/hypomania). The remaining 12-month cases had profiles of internalizing-externalizing comorbidity (C2; 5.8%), internalizing comorbidity (C3; 14.6%), and pure disorders (C4; 16.1%). The 1.9% of students in C1 had much higher prevalence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors than other students. Specifically, 15.4% of students in C1 made a suicide attempt in the 12 months before the survey compared with 1.3-2.6% of students with disorders in C2-4, 0.2% of students with lifetime disorders but no 12-month disorders (C5), and 0.1% of students with no lifetime disorders (C6). Conclusions In line with prior research, comorbid mental disorders were common; however, sociodemographic correlates of LCA profiles were modest. The high level of comorbidity underscores the need to develop and test transdiagnostic approaches for treatment in college students.

AB In the U.S., fewer than half of children and adolescents who report mental disorders receive care and the needs of those who receive care have yet to be explored. There is a scarcity of studies examining the needs of adolescents with mental conditions and at risk for suicide. Learning directly from the adolescents can fill in this gap by providing insight that clinicians and researchers lack about adolescents' experience. This study uses Photovoice, a Community-Based Participatory Research method that involves focus groups and the use of cameras by participants to visually capture their reality and express their ideas through photographs. By using Photovoice, this study aims to provide an opportunity for adolescents to voice their own perspectives and for researchers and clinicians to gain an understanding of adolescents' life experience away from the treatment setting, as well as their experience as consumers of mental health services. Four participants, including two 15 year olds and two 17 year olds, were recruited from a mental health clinic in New York City. Parental consent and adolescent assent were collected per Institutional Review Board requirements. Thematic analysis was used to identify and report response patterns. Four themes emerged: (i) sense of self, (ii) family, (iii) suicidal ideation and (iv) treatment. Findings suggest that Photovoice is valued by adolescents and leads to critical thinking, self-reflection, discovering strengths and social support. Adolescents reported feeling empowered, which is the ultimate goal of Photovoice. Photovoice presents a powerful opportunity to be used as therapeutic strategy with adolescents that demands further research.

AB BackgroundsSuicidal ideation is an important public health issue due to devastating mortality. In the meantime, interpersonal trust was found to be negatively associated with mental disorder and physical health. Although there is increasing evidence that interpersonal trust is a significant predictor of suicidal ideation, evidence of this association is still lacking in the developing world. The aim of this study was to test the association between interpersonal trust and suicidal ideation among older adults in China.MethodsUsing a multi-stage stratified sampling strategy, 7070 older adults aged 60 and above from Shandong Province, China were recruited in this study. Socio-demographic characteristics, health status, family relationship, psychological distress, interpersonal trust and suicidal ideation in the last 12months were obtained through face to face interviews. The association between interpersonal trust and suicidal ideation was assessed using multiple logistic regression models adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics, health status, family relationship and psychological distress.Results7.1% of participants reported suicidal ideation in the past 12months, which was related to gender, resident area, marital status, educational level, self-rated economic, chronic disease, self-rated health status and family relationship within 1 month, psychological distress and interpersonal trust. After adjusting for sociodemographic factors, health status, family relationship and psychological distress, interpersonal mistrust was associated with two times odds of suicidal ideation when compared to interpersonal trustConclusionsThe interpersonal trust was associated with suicidal ideation among elderly in Shandong, China. Intervention approaches regarding inducing and promoting interpersonal trust should be developed to prevent suicide.

AB Background: In contrast with most developed countries, mortality from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) continues to rise in China. We examined secular trends and age, period, and cohort effects in mortality from AMI in China from 1987 to 2014.
   Methods: Data on deaths from AMI between 1987 and 2014 were obtained from the Chinese Health Statistics Annual Report (1987-2001) and the Chinese Health Statistics Yearbook (2003-2015). We then conducted an age-period-cohort analysis using the intrinsic estimator approach.
   Results: There was an upward trend in AMI mortality in both urban and rural populations that accelerated from 2004 onwards. AMImortality increased 5.6-fold from1987 to 2014. The net age effect on AMImortality increased exponentially. AMI mortality risk in the 80-84 years of age bracket was 220.15 and 190.70 times higher than in the 15-19 years of age bracket in urban and rural populations, respectively. Therewas a V-shaped trend in the net period effect between 1999 and 2009. Meanwhile, although there was a global reduction in the cohort effect in urban and rural AMI mortality, we found a modest increase among urban populations born between 1975 and 1989 and rural populations born between 1990 and 1999.
   Conclusion: The changes in exposure to lifestyle-related risk factors and triggers such as air pollution have contributed to the increase in AMI mortality in China over recent decades. The sharp increase in AMI mortality since 2004 is primarily attributable to population aging and the rise in AMI deaths among younger generations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and predictors of service utilization for mental health problems of the first-generation migrant population in Shenzhen, China, a city that attracts millions of unskilled rural laborers each year. Methods: Using the structured World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview, the investigators conducted face-to-face surveys between September 1, 2005, and January 30, 2006. A total of 7,134 respondents age 18 years and above finished the surveys. The main outcomes were prevalence of mental disorders according to DSM-IV criteria, as well as prevalence of mental health services used in different sectors. Results: Nine percent of the sample had ever used some type of service for mental health issues, and 6.3% used services outside of the health service sector, such as human services and complementary and alternative medicine. In addition, DSM criteria for a mental disorder over the lifetime were met by 18.1% of respondents; of the respondents with a mental disorder, 18.3% had used mental health services at least once. Migrants who were unmarried, had high family income, were raised in metropolitan areas, had histories of homelessness or attempted suicide, had a psychotic disorder, or had an anxiety disorder were more likely to use services for mental health care. Conclusions: In Shenzhen, few migrants used mental health services and most used complementary and alternative medicine services. Future studies of service utilization patterns in migrant populations should give special attention to personal characteristics, such as family support.

AB Objective: To examine prevalence, correlates, comorbidity and treatment-seeking among individuals with a lifetime major depressive episode (MDE) with and without atypical features.
   Method: Data were derived from the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, a large cross-sectional survey of a representative sample (N = 43,093) of the US population that assessed psychiatric disorders using the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule-DSM-IVVersion (AUDADIS-IV). Comparison groups were defined based on the presence or absence of hypersomnia or hyperphagia in individuals who met criteria for lifetime DSM-IV MDE.
   Results: The presence of atypical features during an MDE was associated with greater rates of lifetime psychiatric comorbidity, including alcohol abuse, drug dependence, dysthymia, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, and any personality disorder (all P values < .05), except antisocial personality disorder, than MDE without atypical features. Compared with the latter group, MDE with atypical features was associated with female gender, younger age at onset, more MDEs, greater episode severity and disability, higher rates of family history of depression, bipolar I disorder, suicide attempts, and larger mental health treatment-seeking rates (all P values < .05).
   Conclusions: Our data provide further evidence for the clinical significance and validity of this depressive specifier. Based on the presence of any of the 2 reversed vegetative symptoms during an MDE, most of the commonly cited validators of atypical depression were confirmed in our study. Major depressive episode with atypical features may be more common, severe, and impairing than previously documented.

AB Objective: This study examined patterns of mental health san-ice use among depressed children and adolescents and factors associated with help seeking and treatment modalities. Methods: The sample consisted of 206 children and adolescents aged 9 to 17 years who were assessed as part of a larger survey of mental health service use in five service systems and in the community and who met DSM-III-R criteria for depressive disorders (major depression or dysthymia). Results: Among the 206 children, 75 (36 percent) never received professional help for depressive symptoms. Among the 131 children who received professional help for depression, antidepressants were prescribed for 40 (31 percent) in the year before the interview. The findings indicate possible undertreatment of depression among children and adolescents, especially among African Americans. Socioeconomic factors, such as the mother's education and the child's health insurance, were not associated with receiving professional help for depressive symptoms but were associated with receiving antidepressants. Parental perception of a child's mental health service need was associated with receiving professional help but not with receiving antidepressants, Also, depressed children were more likely to receive antidepressants when the) had life-threatening or severe symptoms, such as a suicide attempt or drug abuse. Conclusions: Whether a depressed child receives mental health sen-ices and the types of treatment received are influenced by different individual and family factors and by the type of symptoms exhibited. Better understanding of these Factors will help in meeting the service needs of depressed children and adolescents.

TI Association of Pediatric Resident Physician Depression and Burnout With

AB Purpose To determine whether higher rates of medical errors were associated with positive screenings for depression or burnout among resident physicians. Method The authors conducted a prospective cohort study from 2011 to 2013 in seven pediatric academic medical centers in the United States and Canada. Resident physicians were screened for burnout and depression using the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS) and Harvard Department of Psychiatry/National Depression Screening Day Scale (HANDS). A two-step surveillance methodology, involving a research nurse and two physician reviewers, was used to measure and categorize errors. Bivariate and mixed-effects regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between burnout, depression, and rates of harmful, nonharmful, and total errors. Results A total of 388/537 (72%) resident physicians completed the MBI-HSS and HANDS surveys. Seventy-six (20%) and 178 (46%) resident physicians screened positive for depression and burnout, respectively. Screening positive for depression was associated with a 3.0-fold higher rate of harmful errors (incidence rate ratio = 2.99 [95% CI 1.40-6.36], P = .005). However, there was no statistically significant association between depression and total or nonharmful errors or between burnout and harmful, nonharmful, or total errors. Conclusions Resident physicians with a positive depression screen were three times more likely than those who screened negative to make harmful errors. This association suggests resident physician mental health could be an important component of patient safety. If further research confirms resident physician depression increases the risk of harmful errors, it will become imperative to determine what interventions might mitigate this risk.

AB In the summer of 2014, students from universities in the contiguous United States (Lower 48) and Inupiat youth from Alaska carried out a pilot project as participants/co-researchers in a process called Intergenerational Dialog, Exchange, and Action (IDEA). This action-oriented, community-based, and participatory research method was first developed in 2008, as a platform for structuring dialog between adults, Elders and youth within a community, and for extending resonant ideas emerging from these discussions through Photovoice and digital storytelling amongst youth participants. This pilot study was designed to investigate the feasibility and potential of university students from the Lower 48 and Indigenous youth from Alaska to carry out the IDEA process together as co-researchers. The results of the pilot suggest that it is both possible and meaningful for IDEA to be conducted by a team of youth co-researchers. We found that participation in IDEA expanded the perspectives of youth co-researchers from both Alaska and the Lower 48 in parallel, yet different ways. Exploring the strengths of older community members, being exposed to different ways of living and being, and having opportunities to reflect on and build narratives around these ideas, allowed all the co-researchers to develop a new understanding of their own communities and their roles and responsibilities within them. This paper shares youth co-researcher reflections of the process and the ways in which the process prompted these new perspectives about themselves, their respective communities and their roles within them.

   Design and methods 1513 heroin dependent participants underwent an interview covering substance use and dependence psychiatric history child maltreatment family background adult violence and criminal history Family background demographic and clinical characteristics were analysed by sex Ordinal regression was used to test for a relationship between number of substance dependence diagnoses and other clinical variables
   Results Women were more likely to experience most forms of child maltreatment to first use heroin with a boyfriend or partner to experience ongoing adult violence at the hands of a partner and to have a poorer psychiatric history than men Males had more prevalent lifetime substance dependence diagnoses and criminal histories and were more likely to meet the criteria for ASPD Predictors of multiple substance dependence diagnoses for both sexes were mental health variables antisocial behaviour childhood sexual abuse victim of adult violence younger age at first cannabis use and overdose As the number of dependence diagnoses increased clinical and behavioural problems increased Childhood emotional neglect was related to increasing dependence diagnoses for females but not males whereas PTSD was a significant predictor for males but not females
   Discussion and conclusions Mental health problems other substance dependence childhood and adult trauma were common in this sample with sex differences indicating different treatment needs and possible different pathways to heroin dependence for men and women (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB Objectives: To measure the timing and frequency of follow-up care during the initiation phase of antidepressant therapy, and to compare the typical pattern of care with current product guidelines. S
   tudy Design: Retrospective cohort study.
   Methods: The study included 84 514 adult and pediatric patients who started a new course of antidepressant therapy for any indication between July 2001 and September 2003. Patients were members of a large managed care organization in the northeastern United States. Ambulatory visits during the first 12 weeks of treatment were identified using medical claims data. Outcome measures were time to first follow-up visit, frequency of follow-up visits, and percentage of patients receiving recommended levels of care.
   Results: During the first 4 weeks of treatment with antidepressants, only 55.0% of patients saw a healthcare provider for any purpose, and only 17.7% saw a provider for mental healthcare. Ambulatory visit rates during the first 4, 8, and 12 weeks were significantly lower than the minimum levels recommended in product labeling (P <.0001). Only 14.9% of patients received the Food and Drug Administration-recommended level of follow-up care during the first 4 weeks, 18.1% at 8 weeks, and 22.6% at 12 weeks.
   Conclusions: Adults and children who begin a new course of antidepressant therapy tend to receive far less monitoring than is recommended in current product labeling. Given safety concerns during the initiation phase, earlier and more frequent follow-up care appears desirable. Further research is needed to identify the most cost-effective schedule of care.

AB Beginning in the mid-1990s, the construct of historical trauma was introduced into the clinical and health science literatures to contextualize, describe, and explain disproportionately high rates of psychological distress and health disparities among Indigenous populations. As a conceptual precursor to racial trauma, Indigenous historical trauma (IHT) is distinguished by its emphasis on ancestral adversity that is intergenerationally transmitted in ways that compromise descendent well-being. In this systematic review of the health impacts of IHT, 32 empirical articles were identified that statistically analyzed the relationship between a measure of IHT and a health outcome for Indigenous samples from the United States and Canada. These articles were categorized based on their specific method for operationalizing IHT, yielding 19 articles that were grouped as historical loss studies, 11 articles that were grouped as residential school ancestry studies, and three articles that were grouped as "other" studies. Articles in all three categories included diverse respondents, disparate designs, varied statistical techniques, and a range of health outcomes. Most reported statistically significant associations between higher indicators of IHT and adverse health outcomes. Analyses were so complex, and findings were so specific, that this groundbreaking literature has yet to cohere into a body of knowledge with clear implications for health policy or professional practice. At the conceptual level, it remains unclear whether IHT is best appreciated for its metaphorical or literal functions. Nevertheless, the enthusiasm surrounding IHT as an explanation for contemporary Indigenous health problems renders it imperative to refine the construct to enable more valid research.

   Method: The National Poison Data System, which receives exposure reports from regional poison centers serving the United States, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia, was queried for single drug exposures in individuals 12 years and older during the period 2000-2014. Medications included were antidepressants, atypical antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, lithium, and other medications used in the treatment of depression. The main outcomes were the morbidity index (the number of serious outcomes per 1,000 exposures) and the mortality index (the number of fatal outcomes per 10,000 exposures).
   Results: During this 15-year period, therewere 962,222 single substance exposures to the 48 medications studied. Serious outcomes rose 2.26-fold and in linear fashion over the 15 years. While tricyclic and monoamine oxidase inhibitor medications were associated with high morbidity and mortality, several newer agents also appeared hazardous. Lithium, quetiapine, olanzapine, bupropion, and carbamazepine were associated with high morbidity indices. Lithium, venlafaxine, bupropion, quetiapine, olanzapine, ziprasidone, valproic acid, carbamazepine, and citalopram were associated with higher mortality indices.
   Conclusions: Serious outcomes after overdose or non-intentional exposures to medications used to treat depression have risen dramatically over the past 15 years. The present data suggest that the morbidity and mortality risks vary substantially among these medications. These differences become important when selecting treatments for patients with depression, especially those at increased risk for suicide.

AB Objective: The present study examines whether the prevalence of vulnerable peers in school protects the emotional health of youth who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or questioning (LGBQ), overweight, or have a disability, and if the adverse emotional effects of bullying victimization are mitigated by the presence of these peers.
   Methods: Survey data come from a large school-based sample of adolescents attending 505 schools. The primary independent variable was the percent of students in school each vulnerability characteristic. Multilevel logistic regression models estimated the odds of internalizing problems, self-harm, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among students who were LGBQ overweight or had a disability. Cross-level interaction terms were added to determine if the association between being victimized and emotional distress was moderated by the presence of vulnerable peers.
   Results: Greater presence of similar students was, on average, protective against emotional distress for LGBQ girls and overweight boys. In contrast, greater presence of students with a disability was, on average, a risk factor among girls with a disability. Several tests of effect modification indicated that odds of emotional distress for those who had been victimized were lower in schools with a higher proportion of vulnerable youth.
   Conclusions: The presence of a similar peer group may increase the likelihood that a bystander or witness to bullying will react in a helpful way. School personnel, health care providers and other youth service professionals should inquire about soda! relationships at school, including experiences of harassment and perceptions of peer support, to buffer negative experiences.

AB Background: Childhood maltreatment (CM) is highly prevalent among individuals with bipolar disorders (BP); however few studies have examined its potential role in the course and outcome of individuals with BP. We aim to examine the dose response relationship between the number of types of CM and the course of individuals with BR
   Methods: As part of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, 1600 adults who met lifetime DSM-IV criteria for BP-I (n=1172) and BP-II (n=428) were included. Individuals were evaluated using the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule-DMS-IV Version and data was analyzed lifetime and from Waves 1 and 2, approximately 3 years apart.
   Results: Around half of individuals with BP had a history of at least one type of CM. Overall, there was a clear dose-response relationship between number of CM and severity of BP across several domains, including clinical characteristics, probability of treatment, lifetime prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity, incidence of anxiety disorders, substance use disorder, and nicotine dependence, and level of psychosocial functioning.
   Limitations: The interviews were conducted by lay professional interviewers rather than clinicians, use of retrospective report to determine CM in individuals with BP, and not all respondents from Wave 1 were able to be interviewed in Wave 2.
   Conclusions: The number of types of CM confers developmental differences in the course of BP with a worse course and outcome of BP. Early identification and treatment of CM are warranted to improve the course and outcome of individuals with BP. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose Incidence studies reported more end-of-life decisions with possible/certain life-shortening effect (ELDs) among cancer patients than among noncancer patients. These studies did not correct for the different proportions of sudden/unexpected deaths of cancer versus noncancer patients, which could have biased the results. We investigated incidences and characteristics of ELDs among nonsudden cancer and noncancer deaths.
   Methods We sampled 5,005 certificates of all deaths in 2001 (Flanders, Belgium) stratified for ELD likelihood. Questionnaires were mailed to the certifying physicians. Data were corrected for stratification and nonresponse.
   Results The response rate was 59%. Among 2,128 nonsudden deaths included, ELDs occurred in 74% of cancer versus 50% of noncancer patients (P < .001). Symptom alleviation with possible life-shortening effect occurred more frequently among cancer patients (P < .001); nontreatment decisions occurred less frequently (P < .001). The higher incidence of lethal drug use among cancer patients did not hold after correcting for patient age. Half of the cancer patients who died after an ELD were incompetent to make decisions compared with 76% of noncancer patients (P < .001). Discussion with patients and relatives was similar in both groups. In one fifth of all patients the ELD was not discussed.
   Conclusion ELDs are common in nonsudden deaths. The different incidences for symptom alleviation with possible life-shortening effect and nontreatment decisions among cancer versus noncancer patients may be related to differences in dying trajectories and in timely recognition of patient needs. The end-of-life decision-making process is similar for both groups: consultation of patients and relatives can be improved in a significant minority of patients.

AB Introduction In 2003, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) implemented a directive that cessation pharmacotherapy be made available to all who use tobacco and are interested in quitting. Despite the efficacy of cessation pharmacotherapy shown in clinical trials, the generalisability of the results in real-world settings has been challenged. Hence, the specific aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of cessation pharmacotherapies in the VHA. Methods This retrospective cohort study used VHA's electronic medical record data to compare quit rates among those who use tobacco and who did vs. did not receive any type of cessation pharmacotherapy. Included were 589 862 Veterans identified as current tobacco users during fiscal year 2011 who had not received cessation pharmacotherapy in the prior 12 months. Following a 6-month period to assess treatment, quit rates among those who were treated versus untreated were compared during the 7-18 months (12 months) post-treatment follow-up period. The estimated treatment effect was calculated from a logistic regression model adjusting for inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTWs) and covariates. Marginal probabilities of quitting were also obtained among those treated versus untreated. Results Adjusting for IPTWs and covariates, the odds of quitting were 24% higher among those treated versus untreated (OR=1.24, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.25, p<0.001). The marginal probabilities of quitting were 16.7% for the untreated versus 19.8% for the treated based on the weighted model. Conclusion The increased quit rates among Veterans treated support the effectiveness and continuation of the VHA tobacco cessation pharmacotherapy policy.

AB Objectives: Acetaminophen overdoses result in nearly 500 deaths annually and a much larger number of hospitalizations. Suicidal overdoses are exceeded in number in the United States by unintentional overdoses. We evaluated clinical, demographic and psychosocial factors among unintentional and intentional overdose patients whose acetaminophen (APAP) toxicity had resulted in acute liver failure. We hypothesized that APAP overdose patients would be more likely to suffer from behavioral health issues and display higher impulsivity scores than the general population.
   Methods: Within 4 days of admission and initial recovery of alertness, we administered a detailed questionnaire that included questions on APAP intake (e.g., dose taken, intent, other substances ingested), the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview modules on depression, alcohol use, substance use, and pain disorders and The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11.
   Results: The group included 44 intentional (single time point ingestions with the intent to self-harm) and 51 unintentional (multiple time point ingestions to manage pain or other condition) APAP patients enrolled in the Acute Liver Failure Study Group registry between 2007 and 2013. Both groups were characterized by similar frequencies of chronic pain, depressive symptoms at time of ingestion and alcohol and substance use disorders, all at higher rates than the general population. Overall, APAP patients scored higher than the general population for Non-planning aspects of impulsivity, with no apparent differences between other impulsivity scores or between intentional and unintentional APAP patients.
   Conclusions: Depression, mismanagement of problematic chronic pain, frequent substance abuse, and increased impulsivity appear to provide the substrate for many APAP overdoses.

AB Introduction: This study estimated the per-victim U.S. lifetime cost of rape.
   Methods: Data fromprevious studies was combined with current administrative data and 2011 U.S. National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey data in a mathematical model. Rape was defined as any lifetime completed or attempted forced penetration or alcohol-or drug-facilitated penetration, measured among adults not currently institutionalized. Costs included attributable impaired health, lost productivity, and criminal justice costs from the societal perspective. Average age at first rape was assumed to be 18 years. Future costs were discounted by 3%. The main outcome measures were the average per-victim (female and male) and total population discounted lifetime cost of rape. Secondary outcome measures were marginal outcome probabilities among victims (e.g., suicide attempt) and perpetrators (e.g., incarceration) and associated costs. Analysis was conducted in 2016.
   Results: The estimated lifetime cost of rape was $122,461 per victim, or a population economic burden of nearly $3.1 trillion (2014 U.S.dollars) over victims' lifetimes, based on data indicating >25 million U.S. adults have been raped. This estimate included $1.2 trillion (39% of total) in medical costs; $1.6 trillion (52%) in lost work productivity among victims and perpetrators; $ 234 billion (8%) in criminal justice activities; and $ 36 billion (1%) in other costs, including victim property loss or damage. Government sources pay an estimated $ 1 trillion (32%) of the lifetime economic burden.
   Conclusions: Preventing sexual violence could avoid substantial costs for victims, perpetrators, healthcare payers, employers, and government payers. These findings can inform evaluations of interventions to reduce sexual violence.

   BURDEN; UNITED-STATES; MODERATE; THERAPY; IMPACT
AB The chronic and systemic nature of psoriasis has a significant impact on direct costs, indirect costs, and patient quality of life. Psoriasis is associated with comorbid conditions that add to the burden of the disease, especially in moderate to severe disease. The total estimated annual healthcare burden of psoriasis may be as high as $35.2 billion, with $12.2 billion in direct costs and $23 billion in indirect costs (attributed to reduced health-related quality of life and lost productivity). These costs vary based on the severity of the disease; pharmacy costs account for the majority of the burden, especially in severe disease. Biologic therapies are largely responsible for the pharmacy costs. Approval of biosimilar products in the near future may ease some of this burden for payers and patients, although new agents have also been recently approved, with more in the pipeline.
   The healthcare costs of psoriasis management substantially increase with comorbid conditions, such as heart disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, and lung disease. These comorbidities also include psychiatric conditions, such as social stigmatization, depression, and suicide. The overall costs associated with comorbidities are estimated to be an additional $22,713 per patient per year. Appropriate treatment selection and timing may curtail the progression of psoriasis, and, as a result, can decrease the economic burden. As treatment options vary based on comorbidities, long-term remission goals, and medication costs, conducting a comprehensive patient assessment is imperative. Drug utilization reviews steered by specialty pharmacists may help reduce costs and improve outcomes by providing treatment monitoring and patient education.

AB Background: Hopelessness is a core component of depression. Our information is, however, very limited on ethnic variations in the magnitude of the link between depression and hopelessness. Using a national sample of older adults in United States, we compared Blacks and Whites for the magnitude of the association between depressive symptoms and hopelessness.
   Methods: With a cross-sectional design, we used baseline data of the Religion, Aging, and Health Survey, 2001. Linear regression models were used for data analysis. Depressive symptoms (CES-D) and hopelessness were conceptualized as independent and dependent variables in different models, respectively. Demographic factors (age and gender), socioeconomic status (education and marital status), and health (self-rated health) were covariates. Ethnicity was the moderator.
   Results: In the pooled sample, higher depressive symptoms were predictive of hopelessness, above and beyond all covariates. We also found significant interactions suggesting that the association between depressive symptoms and hopelessness is weaker among Blacks compared to Whites. In ethnic-specific models, there were significant associations between depressive symptoms and hopelessness among Whites but not Blacks.
   Conclusion: Depressive symptoms accompany more hopelessness among Whites than Blacks. This finding may explain why Blacks with depression have a lower tendency to commit suicide. Future research should test whether or not Whites with depression better respond to psychotherapies and cognitive behavioral therapies that focus on hope enhancement. This finding may explain differential correlates of depression based on race and ethnicity.

AB ObjectiveWe previously found that compared with Europe more parents of the USA patients were positive for a mood disorder, and that this was associated with early onset bipolar disorder. Here we examine family history of psychiatric illness in more detail across several generations.MethodsA total of 968 outpatients (average age 41) with bipolar disorder from four sites in the USA and three in the Netherlands and Germany (abbreviated as Europe) gave informed consent and provided detailed demographic and family history information on a patient questionnaire. Family history of psychiatric illness (bipolar disorder, unipolar depression, suicide attempt, alcohol abuse, substance abuse, and other illness) was collected for each parent, four grandparents, siblings, and children.ResultsParents of the probands with bipolar disorder from the USA compared with Europe had a significantly higher incidence of both unipolar and bipolar mood disorders, as well as each of the other psychiatric conditions listed above. With a few exceptions, this burden of psychiatric disorders was also significantly greater in the grandparents, siblings, and children of the USA versus European patients.ConclusionThe increased complexity of psychiatric illness and its occurrence over several generations in the families of patients with bipolar disorder from the USA versus Europe could be contributing to the higher incidence of childhood onsets and greater virulence of illness in the USA compared with Europe. These data are convergent with others suggesting increased both genetic and environmental risk in the USA, but require replication in epidemiologically-derived populations with data based on interviews of the family members.

AB Adolescence is known to be a time of exploration and initiation of risky behaviors. Much attention has been given to risk behaviors such as smoking, violence, and sexual promiscuity; other serious behaviors such as self-strangulation or the choking game, which is carried out by adolescents in response to peer pressures or to gain a transient sense of euphoria, have received little attention, with the available literature coming from the developed world.
   This is the first report of cases of non-suicidal self-strangulation from the Arab World. In this case series, we report 5 cases of non-suicidal self-strangulation that presented to the Emergency Department of a tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia during 2010-2012. All of the 5 cases were young male adolescents aged 10-13 years. This activity resulted in the death of 2 boys; one boy sustained hypoxic ischemic insult to the brain with clinical deficits; and the remaining 2 were fortunate to be discharged home in healthy condition. None of the cases had underlying mental health problems, and multidisciplinary involvement ruled out suicide and homicide activities.
   Non-suicidal self-strangulation is a fatal behavior that adolescents engage in. Increased efforts are needed to address this serious and preventable public health issue. Awareness and education of adolescents and their parents is crucial. Awareness of healthcare providers is also necessary in order to avoid misdiagnosis of such cases.

   AGE; INJURIES
AB Objective: Despite minimum-purchase-age laws, young people regularly drink alcohol. This study estimated the magnitude and costs of problems resulting from underage drinking by category-traffic crashes, violence, property crime, suicide, bums, drownings, fetal alcohol syndrome, high-risk sex, poisonings, psychoses, and dependency treatment-and compared those costs with associated alcohol sales. Previous studies did not break out costs of alcohol problems by age. Method: For each category of alcohol-related problems, we estimated fatal and nonfatal cases attributable to underage alcohol use. We multiplied alcohol-attributable cases by estimated costs per case to obtain total costs for each problem. Results: Underage drinking accounted for at least 16% of alcohol sales in 2001. It led to 3,170 deaths and 2.6 million other harmful events. The estimated $61.9 billion bill (relative SE = 18.5%) included $5.4 billion in medical costs, $14.9 billion in work loss and other resource costs, and $41.6 billion in lost quality of life. Quality-of-life costs, which accounted for 67% of total costs, required challenging indirect measurement. Alcohol-attributable violence and traffic crashes dominated the costs. Leaving aside quality of life, the societal harm of $1 per drink consumed by an underage drinker exceeded the average purchase price of $0.90 or the associated $0.10 in tax revenues. Conclusions: Recent attention has focused on problems resulting from youth use of illicit drugs and tobacco. In light of the associated substantial injuries, deaths, and high costs to society, youth drinking behaviors merit the same kind of serious attention.

AB Background: The media has devoted significant attention to anecdotes of individuals who post messages on Facebook prior to suicide. However, it is unclear to what extent social media is perceived as a source of help or how it compares to other sources of potential support for mental health problems.
   Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the degree to which military veterans with depression use social media for help-seeking in comparison to other more traditional sources of help.
   Methods: Cross-sectional self-report survey of 270 adult military veterans with probable major depression. Help-seeking intentions were measured with a modified General Help-Seeking Questionnaire. Facebook users and nonusers were compared via t tests, Chi-square, and mixed effects regression models. Associations between types of help-seeking were examined using mixed effects models.
   Results: The majority of participants were users of social media, primarily Facebook (n=162). Mean overall help-seeking intentions were similar between Facebook users and nonusers, even after adjustment for potential confounders. Facebook users were very unlikely to turn to Facebook as a venue for support when experiencing either emotional problems or suicidal thoughts. Compared to help-seeking intentions for Facebook, help-seeking intentions for formal (eg, psychologists), informal (eg, friends), or phone helpline sources of support were significantly higher. Results did not substantially change when examining users of other social media, women, or younger adults.
   Conclusions: In its current form, the social media platform Facebook is not seen as a venue to seek help for emotional problems or suicidality among veterans with major depression in the United States.

AB The comorbidity of any substance use disorder and another mental disorder is defined as dual diagnosis. Dual diagnosis is very common and clinical and therapeutic consequences have been described. This cross-sectional study aimed to analyse health-related quality of life (HRQoL) according to clinical characteristics and psychiatric comorbidities in patients with substance dependence.
   A total of 1276 substance-dependent patients seeking treatment were recruited. HRQoL was evaluated by the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire. The SCID-I, SCID-II and Conners' adult ADHD diagnostic interview were used to evaluate dual diagnosis. A visual analogue scale was used to measure craving. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed, and correction for multiple tests was conducted.
   Substance-dependent patients had impaired quality of life, especially in the mental component. SF-36 physical and mental component scores were 47.7 +/- 10.9 and 36.1 +/- 14.1, respectively. Furthermore, 65% of the patients had dual diagnosis, 51% had an Axis I DSM-IV-TR mental disorder and 35% had some personality disorder. Impaired physical quality of life was independently associated with medical condition, age, being female, depressive disorder and anxiety disorder. Depression disorder, any personality disorder, active consumption last month, Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorder, suicide attempt were independently associated with worse mental quality of life.
   These findings emphasize the significance of dual diagnosis in the impairment of HRQoL in substance-dependent patients, particularly with regard to mental component. In addicted patients with low scores on SF-36, psychiatric comorbidity should be evaluated and treated in an integrated approach.

AB OBJECTIVE: Recent policy initiatives aiming to reduce firearm morbidity focus on mental health and illness. However, few studies have simultaneously examined mental health and behavioral predictors within families, or their longitudinal association with newly acquiring a firearm.
   METHODS: Population-based, longitudinal survey of 4251 parents of fifth-grade students in 3 US metropolitan areas; 2004 to 2011. Multivariate logistic models were used to assess associations between owning or acquiring a firearm and parent mental illness and substance use.
   RESULTS: Ninety-three percent of parents interviewed were women. Overall, 19.6% of families reported keeping a firearm in the home. After adjustment for confounders, history of depression (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.77), binge drinking (aOR 1.75; 95% CI, 1.14-2.68), and illicit drug use (aOR 1.75; 95% CI, 1.12-2.76) were associated with a higher likelihood of keeping a firearm in the home. After a mean of 3.1 years, 6.1% of parents who did not keep a firearm in the home at baseline acquired one by follow-up and kept it in the home (average annual likelihood = 2.1%). No risk factors for self-harm or other violence were associated with newly acquiring a gun in the home.
   CONCLUSIONS: Families with risk factors for self-harm or other violence have a modestly greater probability of having a firearm in the home compared with families without risk factors, and similar probability of newly acquiring a firearm. Treatment interventions for many of these risk factors might reduce firearm-related morbidity.

AB We examined the 16-year mortality experience among participants in the baseline examination (1985-86) of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study, a U.S. cohort of 5115 urban adults initially 18-30 years old and balanced by sex and race (black and whites) in the USA. We observed 127 deaths (annual mortality of 0.15%). Compared to white women, the rate ratio (95% confidence interval) of all-cause mortality was 9.3 (4.4, 19.4) among black men, 5.3 (2.5, 11.4) among white men and 2.7 (1.2, 6.1) among black women. The predominant causes of death, which also differed greatly by sex-race, were AIDS (28% of deaths), homicide (16%), unintentional injury (10%), suicide (7%), cancer (7%) and coronary disease (7%). The significant baseline predictors of all-cause mortality in multivariate analysis were male sex, black race, diabetes, self-reported liver and kidney disease, current cigarette smoking and low social support. Two other factors, self-reported thyroid disease and high hostility, were significant predictors in analyses adjusted for age, sex and race. In conclusion, we found striking differences in the rates and underlying cause of death across sex-race groups and several independent predictors of young adult mortality that have major implications for preventive medicine and social policies.

AB Objective. To validate a risk index that estimates the likelihood of overdose or serious opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) among medical users of prescription opioids.
   Subjects and Methods. A case-control analysis of 18,365,497 patients with an opioid prescription from 2009 to 2013 in the IMS PharMetrics Plus commercially insured health plan claims database (CIP). An OIRD event occurred in 7,234 cases. Four controls were selected per case. Validity of the Risk Index for Overdose or Serious Opioid-induced Respiratory Depression (RIOSORD), developed previously using Veterans Health Administration (VHA) patient data, was assessed. Multivariable logistic regression was used within the CIP study population to develop a slightly refined RIOSORD. The composition and performance of the CIP-based RIOSORD was evaluated and compared with VHA-based RIOSORD.
   Results. VHA-RIOSORD performed well in discriminating OIRD events in CIP (C-statistic 5 0.85). Additionally, re-estimation of logistic model coefficients in CIP yielded a 0.90 C-statistic. The resulting comorbidity and pharmacotherapy variables most highly associated with OIRD and retained in the CIP-RIOSORD were largely concordant with VHARIOSORD. These variables included neuropsychiatric and cardiopulmonary disorders, impaired drug excretion, opioid characteristics, and concurrent psychoactive medications. The average predicted probability of OIRD ranged from 2% to 83%, with excellent agreement between predicted and observed incidence across risk classes.
   Conclusions. RIOSORD had excellent predictive accuracy in a large population of US medical users of prescription opioids, similar to its performance in VHA. This practical risk index is designed to support clinical decision-making for safer opioid prescribing, and its clinical utility should be evaluated prospectively.

AB Background Asian-Americans outlive whites by an average of nearly 8 years. By determining the sources of the Asian mortality advantage, we can pinpoint where there is the greatest potential for raising the life expectancy of whites and other groups in the USA.
   Methods Our analyses include all Asian and white deaths in the USA between 2006 and 2010, from the Center for Disease Control. Using the International Classification of Diseases (V.10), we code causes of deaths into 19 categories, based on the most common causes as well as causes particularly relevant to racial differences. We then create life tables and apply a newly-developed demographic method to determine whether Asians have longer life expectancy because they are less likely than whites to die of causes of death that strike at younger ages, or because they tend to outlive whites regardless of cause of death.
   Results Nearly 90% of the Asian-white life expectancy gap is attributable to the fact that Asians tend to outlive whites regardless of the cause of death. The causes that contribute the most to the gap are heart disease (24%) and cancers (18%). Men contribute somewhat more to the gap than women do (55% vs 45%), primarily because Asian-white differences in mortality are greater among men than among women with respect to suicide, traffic accidents and accidental poisoning.
   Conclusions For almost all causes of death, Asian victims tend to be older than white victims. The greatest potential for raising the life expectancy of whites to that of Asians, then, resides in efforts that effectively increase whites' average age at death for the most common causes of death.

AB This study builds on previous research on predictors of depression and anxiety in veterinary medical students and reports data on three veterinary cohorts from two universities through their first three semesters of study. Across all three semesters, 49%, 65%, and 69% of the participants reported depression levels at or above the clinical cut-off, suggesting a remarkably high percentage of students experiencing significant levels of depression symptoms. Further, this study investigated the relationship between common stressors experienced by veterinary students and mental health, general health, and academic performance. A factor analysis revealed four factors among stressors common to veterinary students: academic stress, transitional stress, family-health stress, and relationship stress. The results indicated that both academic stress and transitional stress had a robust impact on veterinary medical students' well-being during their first three semesters of study. As well, academic stress negatively impacted students in the areas of depression and anxiety symptoms, life satisfaction, general health, perception of academic performance, and grade point average (GPA). Transitional stress predicted increased depression and anxiety symptoms and decreased life satisfaction. This study helped to further illuminate the magnitude of the problem of depression and anxiety symptoms in veterinary medical students and identified factors most predictive of poor outcomes in the areas of mental health, general health, and academic performance. The discussion provides recommendations for considering structural changes to veterinary educational curricula to reduce the magnitude of academic stressors. Concurrently, recommendations are suggested for mental health interventions to help increase students' resistance to environmental stressors.

TI Extending the bereavement exclusion for major depression to other losses
   - Evidence from the National Comorbidity Survey
SO ARCHIVES OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY

ID COMPLICATED GRIEF; CLINICAL-SIGNIFICANCE; DIAGNOSTIC-CRITERIA;
   MENTAL-DISORDERS; UNITED-STATES; COMMUNITY; PREVALENCE; SYMPTOMS
AB Context: Symptoms of intense bereavement-related sadness may resemble those of major depressive disorder ( MDD) but may not indicate a mental disorder. To avert false-positive diagnoses, DSM criteria for MDD exclude uncomplicated bereavement of brief duration and modest severity. However, the DSM does not similarly exempt depressive reactions to other losses, even when they are uncomplicated in duration and severity.
   Objective: To test the validity of the DSM exclusion of uncomplicated depressive symptoms only in response to bereavement but not in response to other losses.
   Design: Community-based epidemiological study.
   Participants: From the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) of 8098 persons aged 15 to 54 years representative of the US population, we identified individuals who met MDD symptom criteria and whose MDD episodes were triggered by either bereavement (n = 157) or other loss (n = 710).
   Intervention: We divided the bereavement and other loss trigger groups into uncomplicated and complicated cases by applying the NCS algorithm for uncomplicated bereavement to the reactions to other losses. We then compared uncomplicated bereavement and uncomplicated reactions to other losses on a variety of disorder indicators and symptoms.
   Main Outcome Measures: Nine disorder indicators, as follows: number of symptoms, melancholic depression, suicide attempt, duration of symptoms, interference with life, recurrence, and 3 service use variables.
   Results: Episodes of uncomplicated depression triggered by bereavement and by other loss have similar symptom profiles and are not significantly different for 8 of 9 disorder indicators. Moreover, uncomplicated reactions, whether triggered by bereavement or other loss, are significantly lower than complicated reactions on almost all disorder indicators.
   Conclusion: The NCS data do not support the validity of uniquely excluding uncomplicated bereavement but not uncomplicated reactions to other losses fromMDDdiagnosis.

AB Background: Intentional self-inflicted injuries present unique challenges in treatment and prevention. We hypothesized intentional self-inflicted injuries would have higher in-hospital and postdischarge mortality than nonintentional self-inflicted injuries trauma.
   Methods: Adult patients evaluated 2008 to 2012 were identified in our trauma registry and matched with mortality data from the National Death Index. Intentional self-inflicted injuries were identified using E-Codes. Readmissions were identified and analyzed. Intentional self-inflicted injuries patients who died inhospital were compared with those surviving to discharge. Univariate analysis was performed using nonparametric tests. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted to compare mortality <= 5 years postdischarge between intentional self-inflicted injuries and non-intentional self-inflicted injuries patients.
   Results: In the study, 8,716 patient records were evaluated with 245 (2.8%) classified as intentional self-inflicted injuries. Eighteen (7.8%) patients with intentional self-inflicted injuries had multiple admissions, compared with 352 (4.4%) patients with nonintentional self-inflicted injuries with readmissions (P = .0210). In-hospital mortality was higher for intentional self-inflicted injuries compared with patients with non-intentional self-inflicted injuries (18.7% vs 4.9%, P < .0001). Survival analysis demonstrated that patients with intentional self-inflicted injuries had significantly lower postdischarge mortality at multiple time points.
   Conclusion: Patients with intentional self-inflicted injuries trauma have high in-hospital mortality, but low postdischarge mortality. We attribute this to high lethality mechanisms but appropriate psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation. However, the high intentional self-inflicted injuries readmission rate indicates further study of intentional self-inflicted injuries follow-up is warranted. Better prevention strategies are needed to identify and intervene in patients at-risk for intentional self-inflicted injuries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID PRIMARY PAYER STATUS; UNITED-STATES; SUICIDE; INSURANCE; OUTCOMES; VA;

AB Recent studies examine veteran status differences in mortality, but none consider heterogeneity in military-veteran health care coverage. We use data from the 1997-2009 (2011) National Health Interview Survey-Linked Mortality Files (N=624,610) to estimate Cox regression models of the association between veteran status and mortality taking into account the type of military-veteran health care coverage and sex/gender. Descriptive analyses provide further evidence that veterans who only use Veterans Affairs (VA) health care services are a distinctly disadvantaged subpopulation with substantially increased mortality risk. Results from multivariate analyses confirm a veteran mortality disadvantage, reveal that this disadvantage varies by type of military-veteran health coverage, and demonstrate that the disadvantage is largely but not totally explained by demographic, socioeconomic, and health status differences between groups. Results further indicate that the veteran mortality disadvantage is most pronounced among male veterans who only use VA health care or who have no military-veteran health coverage, respectively, relative to male non-veterans with no military-veteran health care coverage. There is a mortality disadvantage among female veterans who have no military-veteran health care coverage, and a mortality advantage among female non-veterans with military-veteran health care coverage, relative to female non-veterans with no military-veteran health care. Based on these findings, we argue that in order to fully understand veteran status differences in morbidity and mortality, future studies must move beyond the analysis of veteran- and VA-only samples, and should take into account variable connections of subpopulations to the military, resultant differences in types of health care coverage, and sex/gender.

AB Objectives: Given the differences between general high school (GHS) and vocational high school (VHS) students, this study aimed to investigate the lifetime prevalence of non-medical use of prescription pain relievers (NMUPPR) among high school students as well as the associations between NMUPPR and individual-level factors and school category.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in GHS and VHS students in 2012 in Chongqing, and 11 906 students' questionnaires were completed and qualified for the survey. Self-reported NMUPPR and information regarding individual-level determinants and school category were collected. A multilevel multivariate logistic regression model was fitted to explore independent predictors of NMUPPR.
   Results: The total lifetime prevalence of NMUPPR was 11.3%, and NMUPPR was more prevalent among VHS students (15.8%) compared with GHS students (9.8%). Overall, the results indicated that VHS students were more likely to be involved in NMUPPR (adjusted OR (AOR)=1.64, 95% CI 1.42 to 1.89). Regarding the individual-level predictors of NMUPPR, below-average family economic status was negatively correlated with NMUPPR (AOR=0.77, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.98), and students with more pocket money were more likely to be engaged in NMUPPR. Students who had difficult family relationships, had poor relationships with teachers, had parents or friends who engaged in non-medical prescription drug use, and considered or attempted suicide were more likely to be engaged in NMUPPR.
   Conclusions: NMUPPR among high school students is a multidetermined phenomenon. The current findings indicate that VHS students are an important subgroup of adolescents and highlight the need for additional research as well as targeted prevention and intervention programmes for NMUPPR.

AB This study aims to analyse mental symptoms, psychotropic drug use and alcohol consumption, in immigrant women born in Finland, the other Nordic countries, Eastern Europe, Western Europe and countries outside Europe, compared with Swedish-born women, and furthermore, to study if age at immigration may have an influence. All women (n = 10,766) aged 50 - 59 years and living in the Lund area of southern Sweden received a postal invitation to a health survey named the Women's Health in Lund Area; 64.2% (n = 6917) participated. The participants answered a questionnaire including prevalence of mental symptoms during the past 3 months, regular use of psychotropic drugs, alcohol consumption during an average week, country of birth and age at immigration. Severe mental symptoms were more common among most immigrant groups compared with native Swedes, but the association to country of birth was not significant after adjustment for possible confounders. Regular use of hypnotics was more common among Nordic immigrants only (odds ration, OR = 4.4). East European and non-European immigrants less often were alcohol consumers (OR = 1.6 and OR = 3.8). Heavy drinking was more common among non-Nordic immigrants who immigrated at a younger age than at an older age. Furthermore, it was found that although East European and non-European immigrants had a higher educational level, they were less often gainfully employed compared with native Swedes. In middle-aged women, country of birth as well as age at immigration are important factors to consider in relation to alcohol consumption, but these factors may be of less importance considering mental health.

AB Introduction: Depression is one of the most disabling diseases worldwide. Approximately one-third of depressed patients are treatment-resistant to the currently available antidepressants and there is a significant therapeutic time lag of weeks to months. There is a clear unmet need for rapid-acting and more efficacious treatments. (R,S)-ketamine, an old anesthetic drug, appears now to be going through a renaissance. Areas covered: This paper reviews recent literature describing the antidepressant effects of ketamine and its enantiomer (S)-ketamine in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). Furthermore, the authors discuss the therapeutic potential of (R)-ketamine, another enantiomer of (R,S)-ketamine, and (S)-norketamine. Expert commentary: A number of clinical studies have demonstrated that (R,S)-ketamine has rapid-acting and sustained antidepressant activity in treatment-resistant patients with MDD, BD, and other psychiatric disorders. Off-label use of ketamine for mood disorders is proving popular in the United States. Meanwhile, preclinical data suggests that (R)-ketamine can exert longer-lasting antidepressant effects than (S)-ketamine in animal models of depression, and (R)-ketamine may have less detrimental side effects than (R,S)-ketamine and (S)-ketamine. Additionally, (S)-norketamine exhibits rapid and sustained antidepressant effects, with a potency similar to that of (S)-ketamine. Unlike (S)-ketamine, (S)-norketamine does not cause behavioral and biochemical abnormalities and could be a safer than (S)-ketamine too.

ID PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS; RELIGIOUS ATTENDANCE; MENTAL-HEALTH; DEPRESSION;

AB Objective: To compare the prevalence of work-related protective and risk factors among Black and Latino male firefighters and to examine the association of these factors to perceived stress among both ethnic groups.
   Design, Setting, Participants: Participants included 1,036 male, career firefighters who self-identified as Black (n=477) or Latino (n=559) from a large fire department in a major metropolitan city in the southwestern United States. As part of a department-wide suicide prevention program conducted in 2008, participants completed an anonymous and voluntary mental health needs survey.
   Measures: The needs survey included questions regarding prevalence of work-related protective and risk factors, the RAPS-4 to assess substance abuse problems, and the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale.
   Results: Results of regression analyses indicated that for both Black and Latino male firefighters, alcohol abuse (beta=.13, beta=.22), self-reported good health (beta=-.23, beta=-.24) and a positive partner/spouse relationship (beta=-.14, beta=-.15) were related to perceived stress. In addition, having a second job (beta=.12) and a sense of life calling (beta=-.10) were related to perceived stress only among Latino firefighters. All associations were in the expected direction as indicated by the signs of the standardized beta coefficients (beta).
   Conclusion: Black and Latino male firefighters reported relatively high levels of perceived stress. However, there were both differences and similarities in the factors associated to perceived stress among the ethnic groups. Therefore, interventions to help firefighters reduce or manage stress need to take into account that factors associated with perceived stress may vary by ethnic group.

AB Objective: Firearm injuries among children are a major clinical and public health concern and one of the leading causes of pediatric fatalities. Our objective was to investigate differences in predictors and clinical outcomes between self-inflicted, violent, and unintentional pediatric firearm injuries for patients who present to pediatric emergency departments (EDs).
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of patients 0 to 21 years old treated in 37 pediatric academic EDs from 2004 to 2014. Patients were classified into the injury intent categories of self-inflicted, violent, and unintentional firearm injury using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnoses and external causes of injury codes. Multivariable multinomial regression models compared groups.
   Results: We identified 9,628 firearm injuries from 2004 to 2014: 109 (1%) self-inflicted, 2,394 (25%) violent, and 7,125 (74%) unintentional. Male sex, increasing age, nonwhite race, public insurance, residing in an urban zip code, and lower zip code-level median household income were all independently associated with violent firearm injuries, relative to self-inflicted and unintentional injuries. Self-inflicted injuries were at the highest risk for hospital admission, death, intensive care unit services, surgical services, and increased length of stay, followed by violent injuries with intermediate risk and unintentional injuries at the lowest risk
   Conclusions: Self-inflicted, violent, and unintentional firearm injuries in children had distinct demographic risk factors and clinical and utilization outcomes. Targeted prevention and intervention efforts should be developed to reduce the incidence and severity of these injuries. (C) 2016 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine

ID UNITED-STATES; MATERNAL MORTALITY
AB OBJECTIVE: To characterize pregnancy-associated deaths and examine the relationship between area of residence and pregnancy-associated deaths and pregnancy-related mortality ratios in Georgia from 2010 to 2012.
   METHODS: The cohort of pregnancy-associated deaths was reviewed and categorized as pregnancy-related or resulting from other medical conditions not related to pregnancy, suicide, drug toxicity, homicide, or motor vehicle accident. Georgia Online Analytical Statistical Information System data were used to calculate pregnancy-related mortality ratio by rural, nonrural, and metropolitan Atlanta area and by race. Causes of death and pregnancy-related mortality ratio were compared by area of residence and race using chi(2) tests; a P value <.05 was considered significant.
   RESULTS: There were 262 pregnancy-associated deaths; 40.1% (n=105) were pregnancy-related. The 2010-2012 pregnancy-related mortality ratio was 26.5 per 100,000 live births and the pregnancy-related mortality ratio did not differ statistically among rural (27.1), nonrural (24.4), and metropolitan Atlanta (27.7) areas (P=.845). Most pregnancy-related deaths were the result of hemorrhage and cardiovascular factors. In aggregate, the pregnancy-related mortality ratio for black women was 49.5 compared with 14.3 for white women (P<.001). The gap in pregnancy-related mortality ratio between black and white women was highest for metropolitan Atlanta (51.6 compared with 12.4, P<.001), less in nonrural areas (50.3 compared with 12.0, P<.001), and comparable in rural areas (39.4 compared with 22.4, P=.281).
   CONCLUSION: Although the pregnancy-related mortality ratio was similar for rural, nonrural, and metropolitan Atlanta areas, it was significantly higher for black compared with white women living outside of rural areas.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Over the last decade there has been increased attention to the association between bullying involvement (as a victim, perpetrator, or bully-victim) and suicidal ideation/behaviors. We conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the association between bullying involvement and suicidal ideation and behaviors.
   METHODS: We searched multiple online databases and reviewed reference sections of articles derived from searches to identify cross-sectional studies published through July 2013. Using search terms associated with bullying, suicide, and youth, 47 studies (38.3% from the United States, 61.7% in non-US samples) met inclusion criteria. Seven observers independently coded studies and met in pairs to reach consensus.
   RESULTS: Six different meta-analyses were conducted by using 3 predictors (bullying victimization, bullying perpetration, and bully/victim status) and 2 outcomes (suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviors). A total of 280 effect sizes were extracted and multilevel, random effects meta-analyses were performed. Results indicated that each of the predictors were associated with risk for suicidal ideation and behavior (range, 2.12 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.67-2.69] to 4.02 [95% CI, 2.39-6.76]). Significant heterogeneity remained across each analysis. The bullying perpetration and suicidal behavior effect sizes were moderated by the study's country of origin; the bully/victim status and suicidal ideation results were moderated by bullying assessment method.
   CONCLUSIONS: Findings demonstrated that involvement in bullying in any capacity is associated with suicidal ideation and behavior. Future research should address mental health implications of bullying involvement to prevent suicidal ideation/behavior.

   FATALITIES; OWNERSHIP; PROGRAM; DEATHS
AB Objective: To assess the accuracy of parental predictions about their children's self-reported behavior around household guns.
   Design: Survey.
   Setting: Family practice clinic in rural Alabama.
   Participants: Convenience sample of parents and their children aged 5 to 14 years.
   Intervention: Questionnaires about firearms administered separately to children and their parents.
   Main Outcome Measures: Rates of concordance and discordance between parents and their children living in homes with guns about whether the children knew the storage location of household firearms and had ever handled firearms in the home.
   Results: Of 420 parent-child dyads, 314 agreed to participate; 201 of the 314 homes contained guns. Children younger than 10 years were as likely as older children to report knowing the storage location (73% vs 79%, respectively) and to report having handled a household gun (36% vs 36%, respectively). Thirty-nine percent of parents who reported that their children did not know the storage location of household guns and 22% of parents who reported that their children had never handled a household gun were contradicted by their children's reports. Such discordance between parent and child reports was unrelated to whether parents stored their firearms locked away or had ever discussed firearm safety with their children.
   Conclusions: Many parents who were living in homes with firearms and who reported that their children had never handled firearms in their homes were contradicted by their children's self-reports. Parents who locked their guns away and discussed gun safety with their children were as likely to be contradicted as parents who did not take such safety measures.

AB This paper examines the epidemiology of nonfatal firearm violence (NFFV) on the Westside of Chicago over three finite time periods: 2005-2008, 2009-2012, and 2013-2016. The trend analysis will look at any significant changes over the time periods and describe the demographic characteristics of NFFV. A descriptive analysis of Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) Emergency Department (ED) data was conducted. NFFV patients were identified by specific firearm ICD-9 primary eCode injury categories: accident, assault, legal intervention, undetermined intent, suicide or self-inflicted injury, and legal intervention. The Pearson Chi-square test was conducted to statistically compare the categorical frequencies of the Chicago metropolitan region of injury, cause of firearm related injury, and place of injury by time period. There were a total of 3962 nonfatal hospitalizations at MSH between the three time periods due to gun violence related injuries. Overall, nonfatal hospitalizations were most frequent for those between age groups 16-24 (52.5%). The number of nonfatal hospitalizations decreased with increasing age for the age groups 35-44 (9.7%), 45-54 (3.2%), and > 54 (1.2%). There were significantly more nonfatal hospitalizations in males (n = 3649) than females (n = 312) across the three time periods. However, there was a 74.7% increase in female nonfatal hospitalizations from 2009-2012 to 2013-2016. There were significant racial differences in nonfatal hospitalizations between the three time periods. NFFV continues to be problem on the Westside of Chicago, particularly for young, Black men. The incidence of gun violence however has not changed significantly between 2005 and 2016.

ID HEALTH-CARE; COSTS; PREVALENCE; CAREGIVERS; ADULTS
AB Objective: The objective of this study was to estimate the US societal economic burden of schizophrenia and update the 2002 reported costs of $62.7 billion given the disease management and health care structural changes of the last decade.
   Methods: A prevalence-based approach was used to assess direct health care costs, direct non-health care costs, and indirect costs associated with schizophrenia (ICD-9 codes 295.xx) for 2013, with cost adjustments where necessary. Direct health care costs were estimated using a retrospective matched cohort design using the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters, Medicare Supplemental, and Medicaid Multistate databases. Direct non-health care costs were estimated for law enforcement, homeless shelters, and research and training. Indirect costs were estimated for productivity loss from unemployment, reduced work productivity among the employed, premature mortality (ie, suicide), and caregiving.
   Results: The economic burden of schizophrenia was estimated at $155.7 billion ($134.4 billion-$174.3 billion based on sensitivity analyses) for 2013 and included excess direct health care costs of $37.7 billion (24%), direct non-health care costs of $9.3 billion (6%), and indirect costs of $117.3 billion (76%) compared to individuals without schizophrenia. The largest components were excess costs associated with unemployment (38%), productivity loss due to caregiving (34%), and direct health care costs (24%).
   Conclusions: Schizophrenia is associated with a significant economic burden where, in addition to direct health care costs, indirect and non-health care costs are strong contributors, suggesting that therapies should aim at improving not only symptom control but also cognition and functional performance, which are associated with substantial non-health care and indirect costs.

LA English
DT Article
DE Prescription opioid; Abuse; Aging; Suicide; Surveillance
ID UNITED-STATES; DEATHS
AB Background: Dramatic increases in the prescriptive use of opioid analgesics during the past two decades have been paralleled by alarming increases in rates of the abuse and intentional misuse of these drugs. We examined recent trends in the abuse and misuse and associated fatal outcomes among older adults (60+ years) and compared these to trends among younger adults (20-59 years).
   Methods: Trend analysis using linear regression models was used to analyze 184,136 cases and 1149 deaths associated with abuse and misuse of the prescription opioids oxycodone, fentanyl, hydrocodone, morphine, oxymorphone, hydromorphone, methadone, buprenorphine, tramadol, and tapentadol that were reported to participating U.S. Poison Centers of the Researched Abuse, Diversion and Addiction-Related Surveillance (RADARS (R)) System between 2006-Q1 and 2013-Q4.
   Results: Rates of abuse and misuse of prescription opioids were lower for older adults than for younger adults; however, mortality rates among the older ages followed an increasing linear trend (P < 0.0001) and surpassed rates for younger adults in 2012 and 2013. In contrast, mortality rates among younger adults rose and fell during the period, with recent rates trending downward (P = 0.0003 for quadratic trend). Subanalysis revealed an increasing linear trend among older adults specifically for suicidal intent (P < 0.0001), whereas these rates increased and then decreased among younger adults (P < 0.0001 for quadratic trend).
   Conclusion: Recent linear increases in rates of death and use of prescription opioids with suicidal intent among older adults have important implications as the U.S. undergoes a rapid expansion of its elderly population. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Subjects: Non-institutionalized, English-speaking women, age 18 and older.
   Outcome measures: Women's self-protection strategies.
   Results: 1800 US women were interviewed ( response rate 73%). They were found to use a wide variety of strategies to protect themselves. Their reported self-protection strategies did not vary relative to their assessment of the safety of their neighborhoods, but 47% avoided doing things they needed to do and 71% avoided doing things they wanted to do because of their fear of victimization. Victimization experiences, either personal or vicarious, were associated with increased weapon ownership and carrying. Compared with those with no victimization experiences, those with both personal and vicarious experience were more likely to have guns ( OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.08 to 2.29), carry weapons ( OR = 2.67, 95% CI = 1.66 to 4.28), carry devices ( OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.09 to 2.26), and use home strategies ( OR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.33 to 2.78), suggesting a cumulative impact of multiple types of exposure to violence.
   Conclusions: Ultimately, this research may help to guide women in making decisions about their choices of self-protection strategies and may help to inform policies about what approaches US women will support. Examining women's patterns of strategy selection in other cultural contexts could be valuable for identifying and promoting interventions acceptable to women.

AB Background: Lower mortality among migrants than in the general population has been found in many, but not in all, previous studies. The mortality of migrants has not been studied in Finland, which has a relatively small and recent migrant population.
   Methods: People who were born abroad and whose mother tongue is not Finnish were identified from the Finnish Central Population Register (n = 185 605). A Finnish-born control matched by age, sex and place of residence was identified for each case (n = 185 605). Information about deaths was collected from the Finnish Causes of Death Register. Cox proportional hazards model was used for assessing the association between migrant status and death in 2011-13.
   Results: The mortality risk was found to be significantly lower for migrants than for Finnish controls (adjusted hazard ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.72-0.84), both for migrant men (aHR 0.80, 95% CI 0.73-0.89) and women (aHR 0.78, 95% CI 0.70-0.88). The difference was statistically significant only among people who were not married and among people who were not in employment. There was variation by country of birth, but no migrant group had higher mortality than Finnish controls. No differences in mortality were found by duration of residence in Finland. The higher mortality of Finnish controls was largely explained by alcoholrelated conditions and external causes of death.
   Conclusions: The mortality risk of migrants is lower than of people who were born in Finland. Possible explanations include selection and differences in substance use and other health behaviour.

AB Methods In the French nationwide Mortalite 2000 and 2005 surveys, physicians reported causes of deaths in HIV-infected adults in 2000 and 2005, using a standardized questionnaire. We used multivariate logistic regression models to study the association between gender and AIDS-defining causes of death, adjusting for other characteristics.
   Results Of the 1013 HIV-infected adults who died in 2005, 247 (24%) were women. Half of women were infected through heterosexual contacts, compared with 25% men. In 2005, the proportion of AIDS-defining causes of death was higher in women than in men (43 vs 34%; P = 0.01), whereas it had been the same in 2000 (47% in women and men). In 2005, women died less frequently than men from respiratory malignancies (lung, ear/nose/throat) and cardiovascular disease (9% of all causes of death in women compared with 16% in men; P = 0.004), and suicides or accidents (4 vs 9%; P = 0.02). Socio-economic precariousness, younger age, less alcohol and tobacco consumption and lack of prior ART explained the higher proportion of deaths from AIDS in women compared with men.
   Conclusions The higher proportion of AIDS-related deaths in women is probably explained by two factors: (i) some HIV-infected women, especially migrants in poor socio-economic conditions, may not have access to optimal care; and (ii) a lower prevalence of risk factors for respiratory, cardiovascular and violent deaths means that the risk of dying from non-AIDS causes may be lower in women.

AB Background: Although much is known about the correlates of heroin overdose, less is known about pharmaceutical opioid (PO) overdose. This study aimed to examine correlates of opioid overdose deaths by opioid and compare correlates between opioids.
   Methods: Analysis of opioid overdose deaths in Australia between 2000-2015, extracted from the National Coronial Information System (NCIS). The NCIS is an online database of deaths reportable to the coroner, and contains coroner's findings, autopsy and toxicology reports. Deaths were categorized into mutually exclusive groups: 1) Heroin deaths; and 2) PO deaths (excluding heroin). PO deaths were examined by individual opioid.
   Results: There were 10,795 opioid overdose deaths over the study period. Relative to deaths occurring in major cities, deaths in regional/remote areas had 15.2 (95 % CI: 11.5-20.2) times the risk of being attributed to pharmaceutical fentanyl than heroin. Relative to deaths among people without a recorded history of chronic pain, deaths among people with a recorded history of chronic pain had a 1.9-10.7-fold increased risk of the death being attributed to POs than heroin. Deaths among people with a recorded history of substance use problems where the opioid was injected prior to death had 7.2 and 1.7 times the risk of being attributed to methadone and pharmaceutical fentanyl (respectively) than heroin.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest the need to: educate PO consumers about the risks of overdose at the time of prescribing; increase coverage and engagement in opioid dependence treatment (particularly in regional/remote areas); and increase uptake of take-home naloxone to reduce opioid overdose mortality.

AB Background and Objective: Identifying international differences in the epidemiology of acute poisonings in children may help in improving prevention. We sought to evaluate the international epidemiological differences in acute poisonings in children presenting to emergency departments (EDs) from 8 different global regions.
   Methods: This was an international multicenter cross-sectional prospective study including children younger than 18 years with acute poisonings presenting to 105 EDs in 20 countries was conducted. Data collection started at each ED between January and September 2013, and continued for 1 year.
   Results: During the study period, we registered 363,245 pediatric ED presentations, of which 1727 were for poisoning (0.47%; 95% confidence interval, 0.45%-0.50%), with a significant variation in incidence between the regions. Full data were obtained for 1688 presentations. Most poisonings (1361 [80.6%]) occurred at home with either ingestion (1504 [89.0%]) or inhalation of the toxin (126 [7.6%]). Nonintentional exposures accounted for 1157 poisonings (68.5%; mainly in South America and Eastern Mediterranean region), with therapeutic drugs (494 [42.7%]), household products (310 [26.8%]), and pesticides (59 [5.1%]) being the most common toxins. Suicide attempts accounted for 233 exposures (13.8%; mainly in the Western Pacific region and North America), with therapeutic drugs (214 [91.8%], mainly psychotropics and acetaminophen) being the most common toxins. Significant differences between regions were found in both types of poisonings. Recreational poisonings were more common in Europe and Western Pacific region. No patient died.
   Conclusions: There are substantial epidemiological differences in acute poisonings among children in different countries and regions of the globe. International best practices need to be identified for prevention of acute poisonings in childhood.

AB Despite significant therapeutic advances, mortality of dialysis patients remains unacceptably high. The aim of this study is to compare mortality and its causes in dialysis patients with those in the general Japanese population. We used data for 2008 and 2009 from the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy registry and a national Vital Statistics survey. Cardiovascular mortality was defined as death attributed to heart failure, cerebrovascular disorders, myocardial infarction, hyperkalemia/sudden death, and pulmonary thromboembolism. Non-cardiovascular mortality was defined as death attributed to infection, malignancies, cachexia/uremia, chronic hepatitis/cirrhosis, ileus, bleeding, suicide/refusal of treatment, and miscellaneous. We calculated standardized mortality ratios and age-adjusted mortality differences between dialysis patients and the general population for all-cause, cardiovascular versus non-cardiovascular, and cause-specific mortality. During the 2-year study period, there were 2284272 and 51432 deaths out of 126 million people and 273237 dialysis patients, respectively. The standardized mortality ratio for all-cause mortality was 4.6 (95% confidence interval, 4.6-4.7) for the dialysis patients compared to the general population. Age-adjusted mortality differences for cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular disease were 33.1 and 30.0 per 1000 person-years, respectively. The standardized mortality rate ratios were significant for all cause-specific mortality rates except accidental death. Our study revealed that excess mortality in dialysis patients compared to the general population in Japan is large, and differs according to age and cause of death. Cause-specific mortality studies should be planned to improve life expectancies of dialysis patients.

AB Study objective The epidemiology, management and cost of emergency department (ED) visits for deliberate self-poisoning (DSP) are described.
   Methods In a retrospective study, the medical records of all DSP patients older than 16 years, who presented to the ED from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2009, were reviewed.
   Results 312 episodes of DSP were included, accounting for 0.6% of all ED visits. 190 patients were women, with a female to male ratio of 1.56:1. Mean patient age was 37 years. More than 60% (n=190) of DSP patients were <40 years of age. Most patients presented to the ED between 18:00 and 23:00. A single drug was ingested in 39% (n=121) of patients. Alcohol was co-ingested by 36% of patients who were mostly middle-aged men. Of the overdoses, 50.8% were due to benzodiazepines, 23.2% were due to antidepressants and 16.4% were due to antipsychotics. Two-thirds of patients were treated with oral activated charcoal and 89% were seen by a psychiatrist. Nearly 90% of patients were admitted to the ED observation ward, with a mean length of stay of 16.7 h. The estimated total cost was (sic); 266 134.89, with an average of (sic); 872.57 per patient.
   Conclusion Self-poisoning cases in Belgium are grossly similar to those in other Western countries. Supportive treatment alone should be considered in the majority of patients presenting with oral drug overdose. Overall, DSP leads to a significant financial burden on the community.

TI Antidepressants and Suicide Risk: How Did Specific Information in FDA
   Safety Warnings Affect Treatment Patterns?

ID PEDIATRIC SUICIDALITY; UNITED-STATES; DEPRESSION; CHILDREN; ADOLESCENTS;
   SSRIS; TRENDS; CARE
AB Objective: From June 2003 through October 2004, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released five safety warnings related to antidepressant use and the increased risk of suicidality for children. Although researchers have documented a decline in antidepressant use among children over this period, less is known about whether specific safety information conveyed in individual warnings was reflected in treatment patterns. Methods: Thomson Reuters MarketScan claims data (2001-2005) for a national sample of privately insured children were used to construct treatment episodes (N = 22,689). For each new episode of major depressive disorder, it was determined whether treatment followed specific recommendations included in warnings released by the FDA. Treatment recommendations pertained to the use of the antidepressants paroxetine and fluoxetine and to patient monitoring. Treatment patterns were expected to change as the risk information conveyed by the FDA changed over time. Results: The timing of FDA recommendations was associated with trends in the use of paroxetine and fluoxetine by children with major depressive disorder who were initiating antidepressant treatment. However, no evidence of increases in outpatient visits (indicative of monitoring) among depressed children initiating antidepressant use was found. Conclusions: Release of specific risk and benefit information by the FDA was associated with changes in prescribing but not in outpatient follow-up. These results suggest that the FDA plays an important role in communicating information to the public and providers. Yet, although public health safety warnings were associated with changes in some practice patterns, not all recommendations conveyed in warnings were followed. (Psychiatric Services 61: 11-16, 2010)

AB To (1) describe the patterns and trends of isotretinoin utilization between 1984 and 2003, (2) describe the characteristics of isotretinoin users within that same time period, (3) identify and quantify predictors of isotretinoin use, and (4) describe the impact of guidelines on isotretinoin utilization between 1984 and 2003.
   Using the Regie de l'Assurance Maladie du Quebec (healthcare utilization, medications) and Med-Echo (hospitalizations) administrative databases, we conducted a descriptive study on a population-based sample of first-time isotretinoin users from 1984 to 2003. We determined the characteristics of these users, predictors of an isotretinoin treatment >= 20 weeks, and impact of guidelines on the number of new isotretinoin users. Guidelines included the implementation of the Pregnancy Prevention Program (PPP - 1988) and the Dear Healthcare Professional Letter regarding possible psychiatric risks issued to Canadian physicians (DHPL - 2001).
   Mean (SD) age was 23.9 (7.6) years; 50% males, 52% welfare recipients, 77% urban dwellers, and 55% of prescriptions were written by dermatologists. Sixty-four percent of patients did not receive any anti-acne medications in the 12 months prior to receiving isotretinoin. Thirty-five percent of patients had an isotretinoin treatment >= 20 weeks suggested by product guidelines. The odds ratio of having a treatment >= 20 weeks significantly increased after the implementation of the PPP and other guidelines. There was no statistically significant decrease in the number of new isotretinoin users following the implementation of the PPP and DHPL.
   These data suggest inappropriate isotretinoin utilization, even more so after guidelines were promulgated.

AB Posterior capsule opacification (PCO) is still the most frequent complication of cataract surgery. A variety of studies has led to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of PCO, and strategies of molecular biology have produced new therapeutic options, such as immunological techniques or gene therapeutic approaches. Surgical strategies and intra-ocular lens-dependent factors also are capable to reduce the rate of PCO. In-the-bag implantation of intra-ocular lenses with a sharp optic edge seems to be effective in inhibiting equatorial lens epithelial cell migration to the center of the posterior capsule. Several PCO documentation systems have been developed that will lead to more exact and better comparable recording of PCO rates. In the year 2000, PCO or secondary cataract is still the most frequent complication after extracapsular cataract surgery. In a 1998 meta-analysis, PCO rates of 11.8% 1 year after extracapsular cataract surgery with intraocular lens implantation, 20.7% after 3 years, and 28.4 % after 5 years have been reported [1]. For the United States, it has been estimated that the overall expenses for treatment of PCO are only exceeded by the costs for cataract treatment itself [2]. In the past decade, a lot of experimental and clinical studies have been performed on this topic. They have led to 1) to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of the development of anterior and posterior capsule opacification; 2) more objective and better comparable systems of documentation and analysis of PCO; and a number of 3) surgical and 4) pharmaceutical strategies to prevent PCO.

AB Background Non-fatal self-inflicted (SI) injuries may be underidentified in administrative medical data sources. Objective Compare patients with SI versus undetermined intent (UI) injuries according to patient characteristics, incidence of subsequent SI injury and risk factors for subsequent SI injury. Methods Truven Health MarketScan was used to identify patients' (aged 10-64) first SI or UI injury in 2015 (index injury). Patient characteristics and subsequent SI within 1 year were assessed. A logistic regression model examined factors associated with subsequent SI. Results Among analysed patients (n=44 806; 36% SI, 64% UI), a higher proportion of patients with SI index injury were female, had preceding comorbidities (eg, depression), Medicaid (vs commercial insurance), treatment in an ambulance or hospital and cut/pierce or poisoning injuries compared with patients with UI index injury. Just 1% of patients with UI had subsequent SI <= 1 year vs 16% of patients with SI. Among patients with UI index injury, incidence of and risk factors for subsequent SI injury were similar across assessed age groups (10-24 years, 25-44 years, 45-64 years). Severe injuries (eg, treated in emergency department), cut/pierce or poisoning injuries, mental health and substance use disorder comorbidities and Medicaid (among adult patients) were risk factors for subsequent SI among patients with UI index injuries. Conclusions Regardless of circumstances that influence clinicians' SI vs UI coding decisions, information on incidence of and risk factors for subsequent SI can help to inform clinical treatment decisions when SI injury is suspected as well as provide evidence to support the development and implementation of self-harm prevention activities.

AB Background: Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) affects 0.9%- 3.2% of adolescents, and more than 20% of inpatient adolescents. Life stress has been linked to BPD across the lifespan, and previous research in adults has linked BPD to dependent stress (i.e., stress induced by the individual). However, prior research has not examined dependent stress alongside BPD in adolescents. Additionally, the potential protective effect of maternal care has not been considered in this relation. This study tested a moderation model expecting that (1) BPD would be positively associated with dependent life stress, (2) maternal care would be negatively associated with BPD, and (3) maternal care would moderate the relation between BPD and dependent life stress.
   Method: The sample consisted of 184 adolescents recruited from an inpatient psychiatric facility serving a diverse population in the Southwestern United States. Dependent life stress, BPD, and maternal care were measured using the UCLA Life Stress Interview, DSM-IV Childhood Interview for BPD, and Kerns Security Scale, respectively.
   Results: Results supported the first two hypotheses; BPD diagnosis was significantly, positively associated with dependent life stress, and negatively associated with maternal availability and dependability. Contrary to the third hypothesis, no significant evidence that maternal care acts as a buffer in the relation between BPD and dependent life stress was found.
   Conclusions: Although maternal care was not found to moderate the association between BPD and dependent life stress, results supported previously found relations between BPD, dependent life stress, and maternal care, and did so within a diverse inpatient adolescent sample.

ID EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT VISITS; UNITED-STATES; SUICIDE
AB Background: We aimed to evaluate factors associated with prolonged emergency department (ED) length of stay (LOS) among psychiatric patients and to develop a multivariable predictive model to guide future interventions to reduce ED LOS.
   Methods: Electronic health records of ED patients receiving a psychiatric consultation and providing research authorization were reviewed from September 14, 2010, through September 13, 2013, at an academic hospital with approximately 73000 visits annually. Prolonged LOS was defined as >= 8 hours.
   Results: We identified 9247 visits among 6335 patients; median LOS was 4.1 hours, with 1424 visits (15%) with prolonged LOS. In the multivariable model, characteristics associated with an increased risk of a prolonged LOS included patient age 12 to 17 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.43; P < .001) or >= 65 years (OR, 1.46; P = .007); male gender (OR, 1.24; P = .002); Medicare insurance coverage (OR, 1.34; P = .008); use of restraints (OR, 2.25; P = .006); diagnoses of cognitive disorder (OR, 4.62; P < .001) or personality disorder (OR, 3.45; P < .001); transfer to an unaffiliated psychiatric hospital (OR, 22.82; P < .001); ED arrival from 11 PM through 6: 59 AM (OR, 1.53; P < .001) or on a Sunday (OR, 1.76; P < .001); or ED evaluation in February (OR, 1.59; P = .006), April (OR, 1.66; P = .002), and May (OR, 1.54; P = .007).
   Conclusions: Many psychiatric patients had a prolonged ED LOS. Understanding the multiple, patient-specific, ED operational, and seasonal factors that predict an increased LOS will help guide allocation of resources to improve overall ED processes and patient care.

AB Transgender and transsexual individuals have unique health care needs and risks compared with the population at large. It is estimated that 1 in 100,000 individuals in the United States is a transgender woman and 1 in 400,000 is a transgender man, although these estimates of prevalence are likely conservative. Transgender individuals are at an increased risk of tobacco, alcohol, and substance abuse; they have an increased lifetime suicide attempt risk; and they are more likely to experience significant stressors in their lives. Transgender patients may elect to transition their appearance to the gender with which they identify. Hormone treatment (and possibly sex reassignment surgery) is a significant part of this transition, and pharmacists must understand the pharmacotherapeutic principles involved so they can better recommend therapeutic agents, provide dosing recommendations, and anticipate and manage adverse effects. It is critical to be culturally sensitive when providing care for transgender patients including using their preferred gender identity, preferred names, and preferred pronouns. It is also essential to be able to identify transgender and transsexual patients correctly within electronic health records to ensure that appropriate care and monitoring are provided. For pharmacists, this means they should know the biologic sex for performing calculations such as creatinine clearance and to prevent teratogenic agents from reaching a transgender or transsexual man who could be pregnant or is capable of becoming pregnant. Promoting knowledge of transgender health issues will enable pharmacists to provide better, more holistic care to their transgender patients.

AB Contemporary American Indians and Alaska Natives (AIs/ANs) who live in urban areas today face the daunting task of navigating an urban landscape while maintaining the facets of their respective Native cultures. While AIs/ANs continue to grapple with the intergenerational trauma associated with forced assimilation, relocation movements, and boarding schools, these traumas have manifested themselves in elevated rates of psychopathology. AIs/ANs have elevated rates of domestic abuse, poverty, suicide, and substance misuse. Furthermore, AIs/ANs, like many other minority cultures often face discrimination in their everyday lives. In light of the aversive experiences they face, AI/AN people have followed the tenets of ritual and traditional healing to address imbalances in the body, mind, and spirit. For providers working with AI/AN clients, it is important to understand who is using traditional healing and why they are using alternative services. Secondary data analyses of survey data from 389 urban AIs/ANs were utilized in order to determine the relationship between experiences of discrimination and traditional healing use. Analyses indicated that experiences of discrimination in healthcare settings were significantly associated with participation in traditional healing. Analyses also indicated that nearly a quarter of the sample reported discrimination in a healthcare setting, roughly half of the sample had used traditional healing, and that the majority of those who had used traditional healing were women, and ages 35-44 (27 %). This study calls attention to the socio-demographic factors implicated in traditional healing use by urban AI/AN people, in addition to the clinical and demographic characteristics of this sample.

AB Background: We compared mortality by cause of death in HIV-infected adults in the era of combined antiretroviral therapy with mortality in the general population in the same age and sex groups.
   Methods: Mortality by cause of death was analyzed for the period 1999-2006 in the cohort of persons aged 20-59 years diagnosed with HIV infection and residing in Navarre (Spain). This was compared with mortality from the same causes in the general population of the same age and sex using standardized mortality ratios (SMR).
   Results: There were 210 deaths among 1145 persons diagnosed with HIV (29.5 per 1000 person-years). About 50% of these deaths were from AIDS. Persons diagnosed with HIV infection had exceeded all-cause mortality (SMR 14.0, 95% CI 12.2 to 16.1) and non-AIDS mortality (SMR 6.9, 5.7 to 8.5). The analysis showed excess mortality from hepatic disease (SMR 69.0, 48.1 to 78.6), drug overdose or addiction (SMR 46.0, 29.2 to 69.0), suicide (SMR 9.6, 3.8 to 19.7), cancer (SMR 3.2, 1.8 to 5.1) and cardiovascular disease (SMR 3.1, 1.3 to 6.1). Mortality in HIV-infected intravenous drug users did not change significantly between the periods 1999-2002 and 2003-2006, but it declined by 56% in non-injecting drug users (P = 0.007).
   Conclusions: Persons with HIV infection continue to have considerable excess mortality despite the availability of effective antiretroviral treatments. However, excess mortality in the HIV patients has declined since these treatments were introduced, especially in persons without a history of intravenous drug use.
