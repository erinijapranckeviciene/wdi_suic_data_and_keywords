AB The aim of this study was to examine the characteristic features of suicides in Thailand between 1998 and 2003. Collected data during 1998-2003 from the Bureau of Policy and Strategy, Ministry of Public Health were analyzed to reveal the mortality from suicide according to age, gender, rate and methods of suicides. Suicide rates were found to have increased to a peak of 8.6 per 100 000 (5290 suicides) in 1999 and then to have decreased to 7.1 per 100 000 in 2003. The average suicide rate during 1998-2003 was 7.9 per 100 000 with a male to female ratio of 3.4:1. Male suicide reached a peak for those aged 25-29 years (21.9 per 100 000) while female suicide showed less variation with age. Hanging was the most common method used, followed by ingestion of agricultural toxic substances. Suicide was most prevalent in upper northern region where HIV infection might be related to the high prevalence. Suicide prevention program should focus on males in early adulthood, and particular measures should be conducted to reduce risk factors related to HIV infection among people in northern Thailand.

AB The aim of this study was to assess the level of suicide attempts in three school-based samples of Southeast Asian adolescents (Taipei, Taiwan; the Philippines; Chiang Mai, Thailand) and determine whether adolescent suicide attempters score higher on measures of hopelessness and loneliness relative to nonattempters. It was hypothesized that hopelessness and loneliness would be related to suicide attempts, and that hopelessness would continue to be associated with suicide attempts when controlling for loneliness. The prevalence of suicide attempts across the three samples of Asian youth were not consistent with Taiwanese girls and boys as the most likely to have ever attempted suicide. As expected, results showed that suicide attempters (in past 12 months and ever) scored higher on hopelessness and loneliness than nonattempters across all three samples and for both genders. However, the statistical control of loneliness demonstrably weakened the association between suicide attempt behaviour and hopelessness across the samples and for both genders, and resulted in nonsignificant ANCOVA tests for some of the sample-gender groups.

AB In 1997-1998 a widespread economic crisis hit the economies of many East/Southeast Asian countries; its impact on suicide rates across the region has not been systematically documented. We investigated the impact of the Asian economic crisis (1997-1998) on suicide in Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Thailand. Suicide and population data for the period 1985-2006 were extracted from the World Health Organisation's mortality database and Taiwanese mortality statistics. Sex-specific age-standardised suicide rates for people aged 15 years or above were analysed using joinpoint regression. Trends in divorce, marriage, unemployment, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and alcohol consumption were compared with trends in suicide rates graphically and using time-series analysis. Suicide mortality decreased in the late 1980s and early 1990s but subsequently increased markedly in all countries except Singapore, which had steadily declining suicide rates throughout the study period. Compared to 1997, male rates in 1998 rose by 39% in Japan, 44% in Hong Kong and 45% in Korea; rises in female rates were less marked. Male rates also rose in Thailand, but accurate data were incomplete. The economic crisis was associated with 10,400 more suicides in 1998 compared to 1997 in Japan, Hong Kong and Korea. Similar increases in suicide rates were not seen in Taiwan and Singapore, the two countries where the economic crisis had a smaller impact on GDP and unemployment. Time-series analyses indicated that some of the crisis's impact on male suicides was attributable to increases in unemployment. These findings suggest an association of the Asian economic crisis with a sharp increase in suicide mortality in some, but not all, East/Southeast Asian countries, and that these increases were most closely associated with rises in unemployment.

AB Adolescent suicide is a major public health concern in many countries, including Thailand, and the importance of suicide prevention programs at secondary school level has been recognized. This is the second paper of a large action research study focused on the development, implementation and evaluation of the Thai Suicide Prevention Program for Secondary School Students, undertaken in collaboration with stakeholders of adolescent peer leaders, students, parents, school teachers and administrators. This involved seven steps: 1) establishing mutual commitment and engaging a core working group; 2) conducting a situational analysis; 3) analyzing problems and needs; 4) designing; 5) implementing; 6) evaluating; and 7) critiquing feasibility. Qualitative data were collected from focus group discussions and in-depth interviews and analyzed using content analysis. Quantitative data was collected using suicide knowledge and attitude questionnaires and analyzed using descriptive statistics, and a t-test was used to compare scores pre-and post-training.
   The Program outcomes indicated significant positive change in the scores of the three stakeholder groups in suicide knowledge and attitude compared with the baseline scores. Stakeholder reflections noted that adolescent peer leaders developed leadership skills and parents and teachers learnt how to identify at-risk children. The process described illustrates how nurses can work with communities to improve health and build knowledge regarding suicide and prevention programs for adolescents.

AB Adolescent suicide has become a major public health concern worldwide, including in Thailand. This qualitative descriptive study explored the perceptions of adolescents, teachers and parents towards causes and prevention of suicide in secondary school students in Chiang Mai. Purposive sampling was used to select 40 adolescents for focus group discussions, and in-depth interviews were conducted with 4 parents and 3 school teachers, from October 2014 to February 2015. The data were analyzed using content analysis.
   The categories of this study were two-fold: 1) the causes of adolescent suicide which could be summarized into four sub-categories, namely parents' expectations, lack of skills to confront problems, feeling lonely from inadequate support, and lack of parental skills, and 2) Prevention of adolescent suicide, which had four sub-categories, namely cultivating self-esteem, parental support and caring, peer support, and supportive school environments. The findings of this study could help as evidence for developing a suicide prevention program for Thai secondary school students and should help parents, teachers and school nurses to understand the emotional needs of adolescents better.

AB This paper addresses pesticide use, environmental problems, and regulations in Thailand. Annually, Thailand imports several thousand metric tons of herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides. Agricultural goods are among the country's primary exports. Over the past decade, Thailand's agricultural sector has shifted from labor- to machine-intensive farming practices. Pressures to sustain high crop yields have led to heavy usage of pesticides. Residues, especially organochlorine and organophosphate compounds, have been found in soil, water, and agricultural products throughout the country. Occupational exposure and suicide are the main causes of pesticide poisoning to Thailand's residents. Recognizing the growing problem, Thailand's government has enacted environmental laws and education programs aimed at minimizing adverse effects of pesticides.

The suicide rate in Brunei is very low (1.9 deaths per 100,000 per year). The majority of the victims were expatriates 82(66%) and hanging was the commonest mode of suicide both in expatriate and local population. The study showed that the suicide rate among the Bruneian Malays was the lowest (0.5 deaths per 100,000 per year) among the different nationalities. The study highlights the demographics and socio-economic background of the victims, methods used in committing suicide, suicide rates in different ethnic groups and predisposing factors. The results of this study would be of use for taking preventive measures to minimize the incidence of suicide. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose
   This study examined trends in the suicide rates of persons with foreign background in Japan.
   Methods
   Using the nationwide death records in the Vital Statistics of Japan, we first reported the age-adjusted suicide rates of 8 foreign nationals (Brazil, China, Korea, Peru, the Philippines, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States) in Japan by sex from 1980 to the mid-2010s. We also computed rate ratios to compare the suicide rate of each group with those of the Japanese population. Second, we focused on Koreans, who had the highest suicide rate in Japan. We compared the suicide rates of Koreans in Japan with Koreans in South Korea to examine whether their suicide rates were more closely related to those of their country of origin or those of their host country.
   Results
   We found that the suicide rates of Koreans and Chinese in Japan were similar to or higher than those of Japanese, while other groups tended to show lower suicide rates. Most notably, Koreans displayed consistently high suicide rates from 1980 to the mid-2010s, which were nearly twice as high as those of the Japanese population. Korean males and females in Japan had higher suicide rates than those in South Korea.
   Conclusions
   Immigrants in Japan were not necessarily influenced by the suicide rates of the host country. The high suicide rates among Korean residents in Japan might be explained by various disadvantages and adversities that they face in Japan.

That compares to World Health Organization estimates of 1.3 to 9.4/100000 and a Cambodian government estimate of 3.5/100000. Suicide rates of males were twice that of females, and rates of those <40 years were twice that of those 40 years. Capture-recapture modeling with newspaper reports proved a reasonable method for estimating suicide rates for countries with inadequate official data. These methods are low-cost and can be applied to regions with at least 2 newspapers with overlapping reports. Means to further improve this approach are discussed. These methods are applicable to both recent and historical data, which can benefit epidemiological work, and may also be applicable to homicides and other statistics.

AB Objective. To identify poisoning and toxic exposure pattern, severity, and clinical outcome in Thailand during 2001 to 2004. Method. This is a prospective study. All inquiries were registered, followed up, and verified. Interlocutors, poisons, patients' profiles, severity, and medical outcome after exposure or poisoning were analyzed. Results. A total 14,428 events was suspected as human poisoning or exposure. After follow-up and verification, 98.9% were confirmed as poisoning or poison exposure. These involved 15,016 patients and accounted for 6.0 per 100,000 populations per year. The vast majority of calls (92.4%) were from physicians. Pesticides, household products, and pharmaceutical products were the most common poisons involved in human exposure, which were 41.5%, 19.5%, and 18.9%, respectively. Patients aged 0-6 years, teenagers and adults with 20-29 years of age had the highest rates of exposure, which were 33.0, 24.5, and 10.5 exposures per 100,000 per year, respectively. Unintentional accidental exposure is the major reason of exposure in children, but intentional suicide was the main reason of exposure in teenagers and adults. The death rate of all exposure was 5.5%. Pesticides cause more severe clinical course and the highest death rate (10.0%). Conclusion. Features of poisoning in Thailand were different from those in Western countries. Pesticide poisoning was the major problem in Thailand. Intentional suicide was the major circumstance of poison exposure in adults, but accidental exposure was the major reason of exposure in children.

AB Mental health is essential for functioning, general health, and quality of life in low and middle-income countries (LAMICs), as for high-income countries. This study aimed first to search in the English language peer-reviewed literature for reviews of mental health promotion interventions in the Asia-Pacific region. A global rapid review by Barry and colleagues indicated a paucity of publications on this topic in the peer-reviewed literature. The second aim of the study followed from this observation. Two systematic reviews of English language literature were conducted as case studies in two countries with known interest in mental health promotion, Thailand and China. The reviews covered publications in peer-reviewed journals and the grey literature. In Thailand, the review demonstrated: strong evidence for an empowerment program for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected mothers; a reduction in HIV-related stigma in a community-based program; and a coping program for adolescents. The second review concerned suicide prevention interventions in China. It found one relevant study, a WHO multi-site study of suicide prevention. We found surprisingly little evidence in either country of interventions focused on health equity or modifying the social determinants of mental health. We agree with Barry and colleagues that there is an urgent need to invest in the policy, practice, and research capacity for mental health promotion in LAMICs so that mental health promotion can be incorporated into the wider health promotion and global health development agenda. This includes the Global Action for Health Equity Network. Evidence-based interventions in parenting, schools, workplaces, and among older people can be initiated or adapted and evaluated in LAMIC settings.

TI Suicide in the Philippines: time trend analysis (1974-2005) and
   literature review
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Review
ID RATES; MORTALITY; THAILAND
AB Background: Suicide prevention is given a low priority in many Western Pacific countries due to competing health problems, stigma and poor understanding of its incidence and aetiology. Little is known about the epidemiology of suicide and suicidal behaviour in the Philippines and although its incidence is reported to be low, there is likely to be under-reporting because of its non-acceptance by the Catholic Church and the associated stigma to the family. This study aims to investigate trends in the incidence of suicide in the Philippines, assess possible underreporting and provide information on the methods used and the reasons for suicide.
   Methods: Data for suicide deaths occurring between 1974 and 2005 were obtained from Philippine Health Statistics. Age- and sex-specific trends were examined graphically. Underreporting was investigated by comparing trends in suicides, accidents and deaths of undetermined intent. To provide a fuller picture of suicide in the Philippines, a comprehensive search for published papers, theses and reports on the epidemiology of suicide in the Philippines was undertaken.
   Results: The incidence of suicide in males increased from 0.23 to 3.59 per 100,000 between 1984 and 2005. Similarly, rates rose from 0.12 to 1.09 per 100,000 in females. Amongst females, suicide rates were highest in 15-24 year olds, whilst in males rates were similar in all age groups throughout the study period. The most commonly used methods of suicide were hanging, shooting and organophosphate ingestion. In non-fatal attempts, the most common methods used were ingestion of drugs, specifically isoniazid and paracetamol, or organophosphate ingestion. Family and relationship problems were the most common precipitants. While rates were lower compared to other countries, there is suggestive evidence of underreporting and misclassification to undetermined injury. Recent increases may reflect either true increase or better reporting of suicides.
   Conclusions: While suicide rates are low in the Philippines, increases in incidence and relatively high rates in adolescents and young adults point to the importance of focused suicide prevention programs. Improving data quality and better reporting of suicide deaths is likewise imperative to inform and evaluate prevention strategies.

AB Depression-related suicide appears to be increasing among older people in a number of countries and occurs consistently in multicultural contexts and among various religious communities. In this study we explored and described the experiences of eight older Thai-Muslims with a history of severe depression and suicide attempts who lived in southern Thailand. The phenomenological method of Colazzi was used to gather, analyze and present data and we employed in-depth interviews.
   Analysis of the interview transcripts revealed four themes that stood out as figural for the participants: (a) "death is freedom from life", (b) "loss and loneliness leads to suicide", (c) "a healing approach through Islamic beliefs", and (d) "need someone to support". The findings revealed that the participants generally contemplate suicide in a state of abject misery. Nurse-client therapeutic relationships are important and meaningful for creating personal trust, safety and confidence through being with such people, and collaborating with them to make various choices, to enhance their self-value and touch their inner life-energy. In the healing process, nurses should consider developing positive connections, attempting to alleviate pain and suf. fering, and providing them with effective support in an acceptable Islamic manner.

AB Background: Depression is a common mental illness among elderly Thais, but little is known about the occurrence of major depressive disorders (MDD) in long-term care (LTC) facilities. This study investigated the prevalence of MDD and suicide risk among residents in an LTC facility in northern Thailand.
   Methods: For this cross-sectional study, a care team conducted a screening program for MDD and suicide risk among LTC residents in 2011. The screening process used the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, the Geriatric Depression Scale-15, the patient and caregiver versions of the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia, the Core Symptom Index and the Mini Mental State Examination.
   Results: In total, 81 (of 113) residents participated in the study. The mean age was 76.96 1 7.17 years old (range, 63-94), and 55.6% of participants were women. With the Mini Mental State Examination, 40.7% were found to have cognitive impairment, and with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, 23.5% met the criteria for current major depressive episodes. Though the majority was in the low-risk group, 26 residents (32.1%) were reported as being at risk of suicide. The patient and caregiver versions of the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia, the Geriatric Depression Scale-15 and the Core Symptom Index proved useful for predicting major depressive episodes among the residents (P < 0.001, P = 0.004, P = 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively), including those with cognitive impairment (P = 0.006, P = 0.020, P = 0.049 and P = 0.012, respectively).
   Conclusions: Nearly one-quarter of LTC facility residents were found to suffer from MDD, and a suicide risk was reported for one-third, though most of the cases were in the low-risk category. Further studies with a larger sample size are recommended to make these findings more precise and universally applicable.

AB Background
   Suicides by carbon monoxide poisoning resulting from burning barbecue charcoal reached epidemic levels in Hong Kong and Taiwan within 5 y of the first reported cases in the early 2000s. The objectives of this analysis were to investigate (i) time trends and regional patterns of charcoal-burning suicide throughout East/Southeast Asia during the time period 1995-2011 and (ii) whether any rises in use of this method were associated with increases in overall suicide rates. Sex- and age-specific trends over time were also examined to identify the demographic groups showing the greatest increases in charcoal-burning suicide rates across different countries.
   Methods and Findings
   We used data on suicides by gases other than domestic gas for Hong Kong, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore in the years 1995/1996-2011. Similar data for Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand were also extracted but were incomplete. Graphical and joinpoint regression analyses were used to examine time trends in suicide, and negative binomial regression analysis to study sex- and age-specific patterns. In 1995/1996, charcoal-burning suicides accounted for <1% of all suicides in all study countries, except in Japan (5%), but they increased to account for 13%, 24%, 10%, 7%, and 5% of all suicides in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore, respectively, in 2011. Rises were first seen in Hong Kong after 1998 (95% CI 1997-1999), followed by Singapore in 1999 (95% CI 1998-2001), Taiwan in 2000 (95% CI 1999-2001), Japan in 2002 (95% CI 1999-2003), and the Republic of Korea in 2007 (95% CI 2006-2008). No marked increases were seen in Malaysia, the Philippines, or Thailand. There was some evidence that charcoal-burning suicides were associated with an increase in overall suicide rates in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan (for females), but not in Japan (for males), the Republic of Korea, and Singapore. Rates of change in charcoal-burning suicide rate did not differ by sex/age group in Taiwan and Hong Kong but appeared to be greatest in people aged 15-24 y in Japan and people aged 25-64 y in the Republic of Korea. The lack of specific codes for charcoal-burning suicide in the International Classification of Diseases and variations in coding practice in different countries are potential limitations of this study.
   Conclusions
   Charcoal-burning suicides increased markedly in some East/Southeast Asian countries (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore) in the first decade of the 21st century, but such rises were not experienced by all countries in the region. In countries with a rise in charcoal-burning suicide rates, the timing, scale, and sex/age pattern of increases varied by country. Factors underlying these variations require further investigation, but may include differences in culture or in media portrayals of the method.

   Editors' Summary
   Editors' Summary
   Background
   Every year, almost one million people die by suicide globally; suicide is the fifth leading cause of death in women aged 15-49 and the sixth leading cause of death in men in the same age group. Most people who take their own life are mentally ill. For others, stressful events (the loss of a partner, for example) have made life seem worthless or too painful to bear.
   Strategies to reduce suicide rates include better treatment of mental illness and programs that help people at high risk of suicide deal with stress. Suicide rates can also be reduced by limiting access to common suicide methods. These methods vary from place to place. Hanging is the predominant suicide method in many countries, but in Hong Kong, for example, jumping from a high building is the most common method. Suicide methods also vary over time. For example, after a woman in Hong Kong took her life in 1998 by burning barbecue charcoal in a sealed room (a process that produces the toxic gas carbon monoxide), charcoal burning rapidly went from being a rare method of killing oneself in Hong Kong to the second most common suicide method.
   Why Was This Study Done? ?
   Cases of charcoal-burning suicide have also been reported in several East and Southeast Asian countries, but there has been no systematic investigation of time trends and regional patterns of this form of suicide. A better understanding of regional changes in the number of charcoal-burning suicides might help to inform efforts to prevent the emergence of other new suicide methods. Here, the researchers investigate the time trends and regional patterns of charcoal-burning suicide in several countries in East and Southeast Asia between 1995 and 2011 and ask whether any rises in the use of this method are associated with increases in overall suicide rates. The researchers also investigate sex- and age-specific time trends in charcoal-burning suicides to identify which groups of people show the greatest increases in this form of suicide across different countries.
   What Did the Researchers Do and Find? ?
   The researchers analyzed method-specific data on suicide deaths for Hong Kong, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore between 1995/1996 and 2011 obtained from the World Health Organization Mortality Database and from national death registers. In 1995/1996, charcoal-burning suicides accounted for less than 1% of all suicides in all these countries except Japan (4.9%). By 2011, charcoal-burning suicides accounted for between 5% (Singapore) and 24% (Taiwan) of all suicides. Rises in the rate of charcoal-burning suicide were first seen in Hong Kong in 1999, in Singapore in 2000, in Taiwan in 2001, in Japan in 2003, and in the Republic of Korea in 2008. By contrast, incomplete data from Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand showed no evidence of a marked increase in charcoal-burning suicide in these countries over the same period. Charcoal-burning suicides were associated with an increase in overall suicide rates in Hong Kong in 1998-2003, in Taiwan in 2000-2006, and in Japanese women after 2003. Finally, the annual rate of change in charcoal-burning suicide rate did not differ by sex/age group in Taiwan and Hong Kong, whereas in Japan people aged 15-24 and in the Republic of Korea people aged 25-64 tended to have the greatest rates of increase.
   What Do These Findings Mean? ?
   These findings show that charcoal-burning suicides increased markedly in several but not all East and Southeast Asian countries during the first decade of the 21st century. Moreover, in countries where there was an increase, the timing, scale, and sex/age pattern of the increase varied by country. The accuracy of these findings is likely to be limited by several aspects of the study.
   For example, because of the way that method-specific suicides are recorded in the World Health Organization Mortality Database and national death registries, the researchers may have slightly overestimated the number of charcoal-burning suicides. Further studies are now needed to identify the factors that underlie the variations between countries in charcoal-burning suicide rates and time trends reported here. However, the current findings highlight the need to undertake surveillance to identify the emergence of new suicide methods and the importance of policy makers, the media, and internet service providers working together to restrict graphic and detailed descriptions of new suicide methods.

AB This research aims to develop the causal relationship model for cyber bullying among secondary school students in the three southern border provinces of Thailand. The data is collected from a sample group of 660 students between the ages of 13 and 18 for path analysis. The study found that the cyber bullying of the sample was most influenced by frustration followed by group violence, violent media, and authoritarian parenting of which the path coefficient values were 0.57, 0.18, 0.18 and 0.04 respectively. While all five of the exogenous variables accounted for 66% of the occurrence of cyber bullying behavior, 61%.of the frustration variable was accounted for by the other four exogenous variables. Frustration, group violence, violent media and authoritarian parenting were found to influence cyber bullying behavior and students in the three southern border provinces of Thailand are therefore at risk of such behaviors. Moreover, frustration leads indirectly to poor mental health and physical weakness, and is considered to be a cause of depression. As a result affected students find it difficult to socialize with others and, may possibly be influenced to attempt suicide.

AB The objective of this study was to identify the impact of a patient's suicide on psychiatrists in Thailand. A confidential coded postal questionnaire survey was sent to 320 eligible psychiatrists; with a response rate of 52.18%). The results showed that 94 (56.28%) of responding psychiatrists had a patient die by suicide, consistent with high rates found in similar large-scale studies in the United States and United Kingdom. Less than half (41.5%) of patients had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, 33% had a depressive disorder, and the others had a wide array of diagnoses. More than 50% of psychiatrists reported personally experiencing sadness, depression, hopelessness, and guilt; 74.5% reported professional reactions, most frequently a review of their practice (93.4% reported being more aggressive in assessment of suicidality). Respondents were diverse in their postvention; 90% of Thai psychiatrists reported that working through with colleagues was most helpful. Family and friends helped. A majority (72.4%) of psychiatrists prayed or did "merit" for the dead patient; 86.8% found it helpful. This finding suggests that cultural sensitivity may be needed to understand the impact of suicide on psychiatrists but also to its response.

AB Background: The Thai Bipolar Disorder Registry was a prospective, multisite, naturalistic study conducted in 24 hospitals across Thailand. This study aimed to examine the correlates of current suicide risk in Thai patients with bipolar I disorder.
   Methods: Participants were adult inpatients or outpatients with bipolar disorder, based on the Diagnosis and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition. All were assessed by using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), version 5. The severity of current suicide risk was determined by using the total score of the MINI suicidality module. Mood symptoms were assessed by using the Young Mania Rating Scale and the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale.
   Results: The data of 383 bipolar I disorder patients were included in the analyses. Of these, 363 (94.8%) were outpatients. The mean (standard deviation) of the MINI suicide risk score was 1.88 (5.0). The demographic/clinical variables significantly associated with the MINI suicide risk scores included age, number of overall previous episodes, the Young Mania Rating Scale score, the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale scores, and the Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness Scale for Bipolar Disorder mania score, depression score, and overall score. The variables affecting the differences of suicide risk scores between or among groups were type of first mood episode, a history of rapid cycling, anxiety disorders, and alcohol use disorders. The stepwise multiple linear regression model revealed that the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale score (beta=0.10), a history of rapid cycling (beta=6.63), anxiety disorders (beta=2.16), and alcohol use disorders (beta=2.65) were significantly correlated with the suicide risk score (all P<0.01).
   Conclusion: A history of rapid cycling, severity of depressive episode, current anxiety disorders, and current alcohol use disorders correlate with current suicide risk among Thai bipolar I disorder patients. Further studies in larger sample sizes are warranted.

AB Background: Occupational heat stress is a well-known problem, particularly in tropical countries, affecting workers, health and well-being. There are very few recent studies that have reported on the effect of heat stress on mental health, or overall health in workers, although socioeconomic development and rapid urbanization in tropical developing countries like Thailand create working conditions in which heat stress is likely.
   Objective: This study is aimed at identifying the relationship between self-reported heat stress and psychological distress, and overall health status in Thai workers.
   Results: 18% of our large national cohort (>40,000 subjects) often works under heat stress conditions and males are exposed to heat stress more often than females. Furthermore, working under heat stress conditions is associated with both worse overall health and psychological distress (adjusted odds ratios ranging from 1.49 to 1.84).
   Conclusions: This association between occupational heat stress and worse health needs more public health attention and further development on occupational health interventions as climate change increases Thailand's temperatures.

AB Objective: To determine the cost-effectiveness of fluoxetine and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for major depression in Thailand. Methods: A microsimulation model was developed to describe the variation in course of disease between individuals. Model inputs included Thai data on disease parameters and costs while impact measures were derived from a systematic review and meta-analysis of the international literature. Fluoxetine as the cheapest antidepressant drug in Thailand was analyzed for treatment of episodes plus a 6-month continuation phase and for maintenance treatment over 5 years of follow-up. CBT was analyzed for episodic treatment and for 5-year maintenance treatment. Results are presented as cost (Thai bahts) per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted, compared with a "do-nothing" scenario. Results: The cost-effectiveness ratios of all interventions were below 1 time Thailand's gross domestic product of 110,000 bahts per capita. The uncertainty ranges around the cost-effectiveness ratios overlap: maintenance treatment with CBT 11,000 bahts per DALY (8,000-14,000); episodic treatment with CBT 23,000 bahts per DALY (10,000-36,000); episodic plus continuation drug treatment 33,000 bahts per DALY (26,000-44,000); maintenance drug treatment 38,000 bahts per DALY (30,000-48,000); and episodic drug treatment 42,000 bahts per DALY (32,000-57,000). Conclusions: CBT and generic fluoxetine are cost-effective treatment options for both episodic and maintenance treatment of major depression in Thailand. Maintenance treatment has the greatest potential of health gain.

AB Objective: The study investigated the prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders and suicide risk in geriatric outpatients in tertiary care hospitals.
   Materials and methods: An observational, cross-sectional study was conducted with 803 participants aged 60 and above attending geriatric outpatient clinics in tertiary care hospitals in Thailand. Participants were assessed using DSM-IV-TR criteria to calculate the prevalence of deressive and anxiety disorders, and their suicide risk. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, Core Symptom Index (CSI), 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15), Neuroticism Inventory (NI) and the Revised Experience of Close Relationships Questionnaire (ECR-R) were administered. Quality of life was assessed using the EuroQoL (EQ-5D).
   Results: The prevalence rate for depressive disorders was 23.7%, anxiety disorders was 6.4%, and current suicide risk was 20.4%. PSS, MSPSS, GDS, CSI, and NI scores were significantly higher in all clinical disorders and a suicide group compared with nonclinical subjects. MoCA and ECR-R did not differentiate between clinical disorder and nonclinical samples. Comparing all four outcomes, the EQ-5D differed most in the mixed depressive-anxiety disorder and nonclinical groups (t = 12.20, p < .001).
   Conclusion: The present findings revealed a high prevalence of depression, anxiety and suicidality among elderly patients attending tertiary care hospitals. Perceived stress, perceived social support, and neuroticism scores were significantly higher in this group. Role of sociodemographic, clinical and psychosocial variables as risk factors for these clinical disorders should be further examined.

AB A large data gap remains on suicidal behaviors among youth in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, despite the increasing rates of suicide in Asian cultures that may be related to rapid economic changes and the loss of social stability. This study was therefore conducted to explore the prevalence of and factors associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among university students in six ASEAN member states. Data were collected in a cross-sectional survey of 4675 undergraduate university students, mean age 20.6 years (SD = 2.7), range of 18-30 years, from Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam. The overall prevalence of ever suicidal ideation and ever suicide attempt among students in this study was 11.7% and 2.4%, respectively. Different rates of these suicidal behaviors were observed across the countries. In multivariable logistic regression models, suicidal ideation was significantly associated with psychosocial factors including childhood sexual abuse, depressive symptoms, involvement in physical fights, and poor academic performance as well as socio-environmental factors including living with parents or guardians and low involvement in organized religious activity. Suicide attempt was significantly associated with childhood sexual abuse, depressive symptoms, low involvement in organized religious activity and being underweight or overweight. Our findings suggest that individual-level strategies for suicide prevention should be targeted toward students with poor academic performance, mental health problems and a history of adverse childhood experiences. Particular attention should be paid to the role of families that could be a potential stressor in the lives of university students. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the associations between negative life events, social support, depressive and hostile symptoms, and suicide risk according to gender in multinational Asian patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). A total of 547 outpatients with MDD (352 women and 195 men, mean age of 39.58 +/- 13.21 years) were recruited in China, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Taiwan. All patients were assessed with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, the Symptoms Checklist 90-Revised, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, and the List of Threatening Experiences. Negative life events, social support, depressive symptoms, and hostility were all significantly associated with suicidality in female MDD patients. However, only depressive symptoms and hostility were significantly associated with suicidality in male patients. Depression severity and hostility only partially mediated the association of negative life events and poor social support with suicidality in female patients. In contrast, hostility fully mediated the association of negative life events and poor social support with suicidality in male patients. Our results highlight the need of in-depth assessment of suicide risk for depressed female patients who report a number of negative life events and poor social supports, even if they do not show severe psychopathology.

AB Suicidal behaviours are one of the most important contributors to the global burden of disease among women, but little is known about prevalence and modifiable risk factors in low and middle income countries. We use data from the WHO multi-country study on women's health and domestic violence against women to examine the prevalence of suicidal thoughts and attempts, and relationships between suicide attempts and mental health status, child sexual abuse, partner violence and other variables. Population representative cross-sectional household surveys were conducted from 2000-2003 in 13 provincial (more rural) and city (urban) sites in Brazil, Ethiopia, japan, Namibia, Peru, Samoa, Serbia, Thailand and Tanzania. 20967 women aged 15-49 years participated. Prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts, lifetime suicidal thoughts, and suicidal thoughts in the past four weeks were calculated, and multivariate logistic regression models were fit to examine factors associated with suicide attempts in each site. Prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts ranged from 0.8% (Tanzania) to 12.0% (Peru city): lifetime thoughts of suicide from 7.2% (Tanzania province) to 29.0% (Peru province), and thoughts in the past four weeks from 1.9% (Serbia) to 13.6% (Peru province). 25-50% of women with suicidal thoughts in the past four weeks had also visited a health worker in that time. The most consistent risk factors for suicide attempts after adjusting for probable common mental health disorders were: intimate partner violence, non-partner physical violence, ever being divorced, separated or widowed, childhood sexual abuse and having a mother who had experienced intimate partner violence. Mental health policies and services must recognise the consistent relationship between violence and suicidality in women in low and middle income countries. Training health sector workers to recognize and respond to the consequences of violence may substantially reduce the health burden associated with suicidal behaviour. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the present study, we investigated the prevalence of psychological, physical, and sexual violence perpetrated by an intimate partner, and the effects on health status of postpartum women who gave birth at two tertiary hospitals in northeastern Thailand. Participants were recruited during pregnancy and interviewed at 6 weeks' postpartum. Measures included the Short Form 12-Item Health Survey, Psychological Maltreatment of Women Inventory, and Severity of Violence against Women scale. Participants reported high rates of psychological abuse, threats and/or acts of physical abuse, and sexual violence. Abused postpartum women had lower well-being than non-abused women on all Short Form 12-Item Health Survey subscales, except the general health subscale. These women also had significant poorer health compared to non-abused women, in social functioning and mental health. The study findings suggest that routine screening for intimate partner violence by maternity services is urgently needed.

AB Background: Alcohol drinking is frequently related to behavioral problems, which lead to a number of negative consequences. This study was to evaluate the characteristics of male high school students who drink, the drinking patterns among them, and the associations between current drinking and other health risk behaviors which focused on personal safety, violence-related behaviors, suicide and sexual behaviors.
   Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted to explore current alcohol drinking and health-risk behaviors among male high school students in central Thailand. Five thousand one hundred and eighty four male students were classified into 2 groups according to drinking in the previous 30 days (yes = 631, no = 4,553). Data were collected by self-administered, anonymous questionnaire which consisted of 3 parts: socio-demographic factors, health-risk behaviors and alcohol drinking behavior during the past year from December 2007 to February 2008.
   Results: The results showed that the percent of current drinking was 12.17. Most of them were 15-17 years (50.21%). Socio-demographic factors such as age, educational level, residence, cohabitants, grade point average (GPA), having a part time job and having family members with alcohol/drug problems were significantly associated with alcohol drinking (p < 0.05). Multiple logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for socio-demographic factors, revealed that health-risk behavioral factors were associated with current alcohol consumption: often drove after drinking alcohol (OR = 3.10, 95% CI = 1.88-5.12), often carried a weapon (OR = 3.51, 95% CI = 2.27-5.42), often got into a physical fight without injury (OR = 3.06, 95% CI = 1.99-4.70), dating violence (OR = 2.58, 95% CI = 1.79-3.71), seriously thought about suicide (OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.38-3.11), made a suicide plan (OR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.43-3.08), ever had sexual intercourse (OR = 5.62, 95% CI = 4.33-7.29), alcohol or drug use before last sexual intercourse (OR = 2.55, 95% CI = 1.44-4.53), and got someone pregnant (OR = 3.99, 95% CI = 1.73-9.25).
   Conclusions: An increased risk of health-risk behaviors, including driving vehicles after drinking, violence-related behaviors, sad feelings and attempted suicide, and sexual behaviors was higher among drinking students that led to significant health problems. Effective intervention strategies (such as a campaign mentioning the adverse health effects and social consequences to the risk groups, and encouraging parental and community efforts to prevent drinking) among adolescents should be implemented to prevent underage drinking and adverse consequences.

AB To explore whether the 'hikikomori' syndrome (social withdrawal) described in Japan exists in other countries, and if so, how patients with the syndrome are diagnosed and treated.
   Two hikikomori case vignettes were sent to psychiatrists in Australia, Bangladesh, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the USA. Participants rated the syndrome's prevalence in their country, etiology, diagnosis, suicide risk, and treatment.
   Out of 247 responses to the questionnaire (123 from Japan and 124 from other countries), 239 were enrolled in the analysis. Respondents' felt the hikikomori syndrome is seen in all countries examined and especially in urban areas. Biopsychosocial, cultural, and environmental factors were all listed as probable causes of hikikomori, and differences among countries were not significant. Japanese psychiatrists suggested treatment in outpatient wards and some did not think that psychiatric treatment is necessary. Psychiatrists in other countries opted for more active treatment such as hospitalization.
   Patients with the hikikomori syndrome are perceived as occurring across a variety of cultures by psychiatrists in multiple countries. Our results provide a rational basis for study of the existence and epidemiology of hikikomori in clinical or community populations in international settings.

ID SUICIDE IDEATION; CONSEQUENCES
AB Aim: The study aimed to assess the associations between substance use early initiation (<12 years) (smoking cigarettes, alcohol and drug use) with psychological distress among adolescents in five ASEAN countries.
   Methods: Cross-sectional data were analysed from 33,184 school adolescents, with a median age of 14 years, from Indonesia, Laos, Philippines, Thailand and Timor-Leste that took part in the "Global School-Based Student Health Survey (GSHS)" in 2015.
   Results: The overall prevalence of pre-adolescent (<12 years) cigarette use was 10.6%, 8.1% pre-adolescent current alcohol use, and 4.2% pre-adolescent drug use initiation. In adjusted multinomial logistic regression analysis, pre-adolescent initiation of cigarette smoking, pre-adolescent initiation of alcohol use, pre-adolescent initiation of drug use and multi-substance pre-adolescent initiation were highly associated with medium (=1) and high (=2-5) psychological distress (of five psychological distress items: no close friends, loneliness, anxiety, suicidal ideation and suicide attempt). Late initiation of cigarette use and late initiation of drug use were not associated with medium and/or high psychological distress.
   Conclusion: Early prevention programmes should target concurrent early substance use initiation in order to prevent possible subsequent psychological distress.

AB Background: East Asian countries have high suicide rates. However, little is known about clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with suicidality in Asian populations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors associated with suicidality in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) from six Asian countries.
   Methods: The study cohort consisted of 547 outpatients with MDD. Patients presented to study sites in China (n = 114), South Korea (n = 101), Malaysia (n = 90), Singapore (n = 40), Thailand (n = 103), and Taiwan (n = 99). All patients completed the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the Global Severity Index(SCL-90R), the Fatigue Severity Scale, the 36-item short-form health survey, the Sheehan Disability Scale, and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). Patients were classified as showing high suicidality if they scored >= 6 on the MINI suicidality module. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to examine sociodemographic and clinical factors related to high suicidality.
   Results: One hundred and twenty-five patients were classed as high suicidality. Unemployed status (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.43, p < 0.01), MADRS score (adjusted OR 1.08), p < 0.001, and GSI (SCL-90R) score (adjusted OR 1.06, p < 0.01) were positively related to high suicidality. Hindu (adjusted OR 0.09, p < 0.05) or Muslim (adjusted OR 0.21, p < 0.001) religion and MSPSS score (adjusted OR 0.82, p < 0.05) were protective against high suicidality.
   Conclusions: A variety of sociodemographic and clinical factors were associated with high suicidality in Asian patients with MDD. These factors may facilitate the identification of MDD patients at risk of suicide.

AB Riemerella anatipestifer (R. anatipestifer, RA) is an important bacterial pathogen of ducks and other birds; infection with RA causes high poultry mortality and heavy economic losses in the poultry industry. However, the pathogenesis of this bacterium is poorly understood, in part due to the lack of a suitable array of methods for genetic manipulation. In this study, we first examined the efficacy of the mutated pheS gene (pheS*) as a counterselectable marker in R. anatipestifer. A suicide vector carrying pheS*, pOES, was constructed and used for markerless deletion of the gene RA0C_2053 which encode a putative TonB-dependent receptor in RA ATCC11845. The suicide plasmid pOES was also used to introduce a "knock-in" Myc-tag into the C-terminus of RA0C_1912 which encode a putative Fur protein. Using pheS* as a counterselectable marker, markerless mutagenesis and "knock-in" genetic manipulation techniques were also developed based on natural transformation. Furthermore, this marker was used to generate a point mutation in the RA0C_1912 gene of the RA ATCC11845 genome. The genetic methods developed in this study provide new and useful tools required to investigate the physiology and pathogenic mechanisms of this bacterium. These techniques may also have wider application in many other members of the Flavobacteria.

AB Background: Pathological internet use may lead to serious psychosocial problems and dysfunction.
   Objectives: The purpose of the study was to investigate the prevalence of pathological internet use among undergraduate university students in five ASEAN countries in relation to sociodemographics, internet use variables, psychosocial factors, and comorbid symptoms.
   Methods: In a cross-sectional survey in 2015 in Indonesia (Yogyakarta), Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur), Myanmar (Yangon), Thailand (MahaSarakham), and Vietnam (Hanoi), 3240 undergraduate university students (Mean age = 20.5 years, SD = 1.6), who were randomly selected, responded to a questionnaire including the "Young Diagnostic Questionnaire for Internet Addiction" (YDQ) and other measures.
   Results: Overall, the prevalences of pathological internet use were 35.9% (ranging from 16.1% in Myanmar to 52.4% in Thailand), maladaptive use 34.8% and adjusted Internet users 29.9%. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, internet use variables (heavy overall Internet use, heavy Internet use for recreational purposes, and heavy smartphone use), psychosocial factors (the experience of childhood physical abuse, childhood sexual abuse, lack of social support, and poor academic performance), and comorbid symptoms (having a self-classified gambling problem, hazardous or harmful alcohol use, past 12-month drug use, severe depression, sleeping problems, having attempted a suicide, and PTSD symptoms) were found to be associated with pathological internet use.
   Conclusions: The study found a very high prevalence of pathological internet use; those students lacking psychosocial support and having comorbid symptoms were at the highest risk.

AB Background: The investigation aimed to estimate the association between carbonated soft drink consumption frequency and externalizing and internalizing behaviour among university students in five ASEAN counties.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey included 3353 university students from Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam, median age 20 years (interquartile range 3 years).
   Results: In all five ASEAN countries, the study found a prevalence no soft drink consumption in the past 30 days of 20.3%, less than one time a day 44.7%, once a day 25.4% and two or more times a day 9.6%. In the adjusted logistic regression analysis, higher frequency of soft drink consumption (one and/or two or more times a day) was associated with externalizing behaviour (in physical fight, injury, current tobacco use, problem drinking, drug use, pathological internet use and gambling behaviour), and higher frequency of soft drink consumption (two or more times a day) was associated with depression in females, but no association was found for the general student population in relation to internalizing behaviour (depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, suicidal ideation, suicide plan, suicide attempt and sleeping problem).
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that carbonated soft drink consumption is associated with a number of externalizing but not internalizing health risk behaviours.

ID METAANALYSIS
AB Depression is a mental health problem worldwide, often a co-occurring condition with disabilities and contributes to a low quality of life and suicide. Older women are more likely to experience depression than older men and need specific interventions to reduce their depressive symptoms. This randomized controlled trial examined the effect of a group administered cognitive behavior therapy program for reducing depressive symptoms among older women. Sixty Thai older women living in the community, who met the inclusion criteria and presented at primary care units in Northern Thailand, were randomly assigned into either a group undertaking a cognitive behavior therapy program (n=30) or a usual care control condition (n=30). Depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Thai version at baseline, immediately after the time needed to complete The Thai Group CBT Intervention Program, and then at 1 and 3 months follow-up. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and independent sample t-test were used to test the program efficacy.
   Results indicated that the mean depression scores in the CBT condition at every point were significantly lower than at baseline and also statistically lower than those of the usual care condition after completing the program. Thus, The Thai Group CBT Intervention Program was found to be efficacious in reducing depression. Nurses should consider integrating this intervention for older persons with depression into primary care; however, further study is needed to demonstrate the durability of the depression reduction effects.

AB Even though there have been previously published reports on firearm injuries in various countries, the incidence and pattern of death from firearm injuries in Thailand have not been studied before. In present study, 149 fatal firearm injuries from 2002 to 2011 were reviewed. At total of 7126 autopsies, fatal firearm injuries comprised of 2.09% (n = 149) of total autopsies cases. Among those victims, 136 were male (91.3%), 13 (8.7%) were female. The youngest age of victim was 10 years and the oldest was 79 years. Mean age of the victims was 33.79 years and median age was 30 years. Outdoor incident was the most common scene of crime. Night time incident (18: 00 PM-05: 59 AM) was higher than day time one. Most of the cases occurred in week ends (n = 52). Homicide (77.2%) was the most frequent manner of death. Head/face and chest were the most common sites of entrance. The autopsy report also study on entrance wound, range and types of projectiles. Blood alcohol concentration was examined in 122 cases and 38 victims showed positive results, 11 cases revealed using of illegal substances in blood and urine analysis. This study also included the association between manner of death and other factors. Age group, time of incidence, place of incidence, number of entrance wound and range showed statistically significant association with manner of death.

AB This research provided a forensic investigative tool for the detection and identification of cardiotoxic ornamental plant commonly found in Thailand. Species-specific primers were designed from polymorphisms in the ITS region of 6 cardiotoxic ornamental plant species, which are Adenium obesum, Calotropis gigantea, Cerbera odollam, Nerium oleander, Strophanthus gratus, and Thevetia peruviana. Sizes of expected PCR products from R_AO02/ITS3G, R_CG02/ITS3G, R_CO04/ITS5, R_NO12/ITS5, R_SG07/ITS3G and R_TP06/ITS3G are 358, 290, 282, 231, 226 and 165-bp, respectively. A positive test control primer pair was designed from a conserved region in the rbcL gene to confirm the validity of DNA sample for PCR-based analysis. Under the optimal PCR condition, results showed that all primer pairs amplified PCR products of correct sizes. Amplification results were reproducible when tested against at least 10 individual plants of each species. Each of these primer pair did not PCR-amplify the other 5 non-target cardiotoxic plant species, 14 non-target plant species, nor human DNA. Correct test results were also obtained when tested with DNA mixture. For agarose gel-based sensitivity testing, the minimum DNA quantities that R_AO02/ITS3G, R_CG02/ITS3G, R_CO04/ITS5, R_NO12/ITS5, R_SG07/ITS3G and R_TP06/ITS3G can detect are 0.005, 0.001, 0.5, 0.01, 0.005 and 0.001 ng, respectively. Agarose gel-based analysis was possible for mock forensic-type specimens, such as dried leaf fragments and tea leaf infusions, but limit to specimens digested by artificial gastric juice.

AB Purpose: To identify the prevalence of risk behaviors and related risk factors in adolescents in Bangkok, Thailand.
   Methods: Youth risk behavior survey questionnaires were collected from 2311 adolescents in 8 schools, 13 communities and 2 Juvenile Home Institutions from January to February 2001. Their mean age was 15.5 +/- 1.8 years, and 59% were female. Risk factors of interest were gender, parental marital status, socioeconomic status, family relationship, parental drug addiction, peer group, loneliness, self-esteem, and school performance. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify significant risk factors associated with each risk behavior.
   Results: The risk behaviors leading to traffic accidents were rarely or never having worn a seat belt (30.6%) or helmet while bicycling (66.9%) and while motorcycling (50.1%), riding with drivers who had consumed alcohol (18.8%), and driving after consuming alcohol (12.1%). The studied group carried weapons (8.5%) and has been involved in a violent event (31.5%). Among 13.9% who were assaulted, 6.7% needed hospitalization; rape was reported by 2.4%. Depression was reported by 19.9%, with 12% having suicidal tendencies and 8% attempting suicide. The lifetime use vs. heavy use prevalence of substance abuse, respectively, was: 15.4% and 3.5% for smoking, 37.3% and 1.7% for alcohol, 37.8% and 4.6% for amphetamine use, and 37.9% and 0.1% for other drugs. Among the 10% who have had sexual intercourse, 1% were homosexual, 7.1% have never used a condom, and 2.1% resulted in pregnancy. Being male was a risk factor for every untoward behavior except depression. Other risk factors included poor self-esteem, poor school performance, and early school leaving. Factors relating to the family included a low socioeconomic status, poor relationships, broken families, and parental substance abuse. Socioenviron mental factors included being in a gang and loneliness. Some risk behaviors started at younger than 8 years old. Schools and media were given as the sources of information regarding sex, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and substance abuse.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of six major-risk behaviors in adolescents in Bangkok was significantly high. Several risk factors were identified, the knowledge from which may help to form preventive measures in this population. (c) 2005 Society for Adolescent Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB Serious intoxications and incidences due to misuse of organophosphorus insecticides (OP) have been reported for over three decades. In this meeting I am talking about the following three topics. (1) Epidemiological studies on the use of OP in japan, Taiwan and Thailand. The National Research Institute of Police Science (NRIPS) in japan has published the annual report of the epidemiological studies on the criminal and suicide events. The numbers of the incidence of pesticides are approximately 22%-30% of the total incidences, during 1991 and 1996. The incidence of pesticides has been gradually reduced for past six years. This seems to be influenced by the decrease of the incidences of paraquat having extremely high toxicity. According to the epidemiological data in the National Poison Center in Taiwan, unlike the prevalence of drug poisoning exposures in most western countries, pesticides poisoning exposures are numerous in Taiwan. The number of pesticide intoxication cases is 6,872 out of 23,436 of total case numbers of various intoxications during the 1985 and 1997. The fatality rate is much higher in Taiwan than in most western countries, with 5.65% of all poisoning exposures resulted in death. Paraquet is the leading cause of death in Taiwan. The ratio of death to total OP intoxication cases is 11.5% including accidental exposure and suicide. According to the report of the Division of Epidemiology, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand during the 1990-1995, the overall morbidity due to poisoning was 30 per 100,000 population with 300 deaths per year. The morbidity rate of reported pesticide poisoning in the whole country was 10 per 100,000 population. (2) Sarin victims in Tokyo. On March 20, 1995, a terrorist attack using sarin (isopropylmethylphosphonofluoridate) occurred on the Tokyo subway. Many people inhaled the sarin gas and collapsed in the train. Eventually, 12 people died and over 5,000 were injured. The results of the forensic studies showed that methylphosphonic acid, the hydrolysis product of sarin, bound to AChE in the cerebellums of the victims was separated and identified using GCMS. (3) A sensitive and rapid biomarker of OF-poisoning. beta-Glucuronidase (beta-G) is loosely bound to egasyn which is one of carboxylesterase isozymes in the liver microsomes. The oxon formed from OP in the liver microsomes is covalently bound to egasyn and causes the cleavage of the egasyn-glucuronidase complex, leading to the release of beta-G into the blood. In fact, plasma beta-G activities is a much more sensitive and rapid biomarker than the blood cholinesterase inhibition.
   In conclusion, OPs cause serious toxicity in both acute and chronic exposures. The epidemiological data in Taiwan and Thailand show that paraquat intoxication cause the most serious irreversible damage in the patients. In 1995, terrorists attack using sarin which is one of the most toxic OF, on the Tokyo subway, and 12 people died. This is an example of the acute intoxication of OP and some people have been still in hospitalized Recently, the present authors have reported that the plasma beta-G activity is a novel biomarker of OP intoxication. The plasma beta-G is rapidly and significantly increased after OP exposure, and this is a much more sensitive to OP intoxication than ChE inhibition. (C) 2000 Inter Press, Inc.

AB IMPORTANCE Human trafficking and exploitation of children have profound health consequences. To our knowledge, this study represents the largest survey on the health of child and adolescent survivors of human trafficking.
   OBJECTIVE To describe experiences of abuse and exploitation, mental health outcomes, and suicidal behavior among children and adolescents in posttrafficking services. We also examine how exposures to violence, exploitation, and abuse affect the mental health and suicidal behavior of trafficked children.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A survey was conducted with 387 children and adolescents aged 10 to 17 years in posttrafficking services in Cambodia, Thailand, or Vietnam, which along with Laos, Myanmar, and Yunnan Province, China, compose the Greater Melong Subregion. Participants were interviewed within 2 weeks of entering services from October 2011 through May 2013.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, suicidal ideation, self-injury, and suicide attempts. RESULTS Among the 387 children and adolescent study participants, most (82%) were female. Twelve percent had tried to harm or kill themselves in the month before the interview. Fifty-six percent screened positive for depression, 33% for an anxiety disorder, and 26% for posttraumatic stress disorder. Abuse at home was reported by 20%. Physical violence while trafficked was reported by 41% of boys and 19% of girls. Twenty-three percent of girls and 1 boy reported sexual violence. Mental health symptoms were strongly associated with recent self-harm and suicide attempts. Severe physical violence was associated with depression (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.55; 95% CI, 1.64-7.71), anxiety (AOR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.12-4.05), and suicidal ideation (AOR, 3.68; 95% CI, 1.77-7.67). Sexual violence while trafficked was associated with depression (AOR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.22-4.23) and suicidal ideation (AOR, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.80-6.54).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Children and adolescents in posttrafficking care showed high symptom levels of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder, which are strongly associated with self-harm or suicidal behaviors. Mental health screening and reintegration risk assessments are critical components of posttrafficking services, especially in planning for family reunification and other social integration options.

TI THE CASE OF VOLUNTEER 8 Proof, Violence, and History in Thai Society
SO CRITICAL ASIAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
AB In March 1973, a villager working for a logging concession in Northeastern Thailand was shot and killed under mysterious circumstances. The story did not make the news and would likely have been forgotten if not for another, more sensational murder-suicide a few weeks later. Working through news reports in the country's number one daily about these two crimes, this article brings to light the understudied terror and violence that plagued parts of rural Thai society preceding the mass protests against a corrupt military government in October 1973. At the same time, it analyzes how information about that violence became known, verified, and accepted as true to an urban audience in Bangkok. Tackling the issues of violence and information together, the author links the relatively abstract concepts of "knowledge production" and "justice" in a tangible case study, showing that the form that information takes and the technologies that produce it play a key role in determining its factuality. The author concludes that in Thai society today, historical truth and social justice emerge through a contingent process of documentation; without documents there is no historical knowledge and no justice.

AB Introduction: Maternal mortality is high in developing countries, but there are few data in high-risk groups such as migrants and refugees in malaria-endemic areas. Trends in maternal mortality were followed over 25 years in antenatal clinics prospectively established in an area with low seasonal transmission on the north-western border of Thailand.
   Methods and Findings: All medical records from women who attended the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit antenatal clinics from 12th May 1986 to 31st December 2010 were reviewed, and maternal death records were analyzed for causality. There were 71 pregnancy-related deaths recorded amongst 50,981 women who attended antenatal care at least once. Three were suicide and excluded from the analysis as incidental deaths. The estimated maternal mortality ratio (MMR) overall was 184 (95% CI 150-230) per 100,000 live births. In camps for displaced persons there has been a six-fold decline in the MMR from 499 (95% CI 200-780) in 1986-90 to 79 (40-170) in 2006-10, p<0.05. In migrants from adjacent Myanmar the decline in MMR was less significant: 588 (100-3260) to 252 (150-430) from 1996-2000 to 2006-2010. Mortality from P. falciparum malaria in pregnancy dropped sharply with the introduction of systematic screening and treatment and continued to decline with the reduction in the incidence of malaria in the communities. P. vivax was not a cause of maternal death in this population. Infection (non-puerperal sepsis and P. falciparum malaria) accounted for 39.7 (27/68) % of all deaths.
   Conclusions: Frequent antenatal clinic screening allows early detection and treatment of falciparum malaria and substantially reduces maternal mortality from P. falciparum malaria. No significant decline has been observed in deaths from sepsis or other causes in refugee and migrant women on the Thai-Myanmar border.

AB Objectives Patients with advanced disease sometimes express a wish to hasten death (WTHD). In 2012, we published a systematic review and meta-ethnography of qualitative studies examining the experience and meaning of this phenomenon. Since then, new studies eligible for inclusion have been reported, including in Europe, a region not previously featured, and specifically in countries with different legal frameworks for euthanasia and assisted suicide. The aim of the present study was to update our previous review by including new research and to conduct a new analysis of available data on this topic.
   Setting Eligible studies originated from Australia, Canada, China, Germany, The Netherlands, Switzerland, Thailand and USA.
   Participants Studies of patients with life-threatening conditions that had expressed the WTHD.
   Design The search strategy combined subject terms with free-text searching of PubMed MEDLINE, Web of Science, CINAHL and PsycInfo. The qualitative synthesis followed the methodology described by Noblit and Hare, using the 'adding to and revising the original' model for updating a meta-ethnography, proposed by France et al. Quality assessment was done using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist.
   Results 14 studies involving 255 participants with life-threatening illnesses were identified. Five themes emerged from the analysis: suffering (overarching theme), reasons for and meanings and functions of the WTHD and the experience of a timeline towards dying and death. In the context of advanced disease, the WTHD emerges as a reaction to physical, psychological, social and existential suffering, all of which impacts on the patient's sense of self, of dignity and meaning in life.
   Conclusions The WTHD can hold different meanings for each individual-serving functions other than to communicate a genuine wish to die. Understanding the reasons for, and meanings and functions of, the WTHD is crucial for drawing up and implementing care plans to meet the needs of individual patients.

AB The study aimed to assess the relationship between bullying victimization and adverse health or psychosocial problems among in-school adolescents from five Southeast Asian countries. The sample consisted of 33,184 school-going children, mean age 14.6 years (SD = 1.7), from Indonesia, Laos, Philippines, Thailand and Timor-Leste that took part in the cross-sectional "Global School-based Student Health Survey" (GSHS) in 2015. Results indicate 18.6% of the students reported infrequent (1-2 days/month) and 12.0% frequent (3-30 days/month) past-month bullying victimization. Among different types of bullying victimization, the most prevalent was psychological (13.5%), followed by other (5.6%), physical (3.6%) and social (1.3%). In adjusted Poisson regression analysis, bullying victimization is associated with tobacco, alcohol and drug use, physically attacked, in physical fight, injury, truancy and poor hand hygiene behaviour, anxiety, loneliness, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, no close friends, sedentary behaviour, underweight and overweight or obesity. This study extends previous findings from mainly high-income countries on the relationship between bullying victimization and a large number of adverse outcomes in adolescents in Southeast Asia.

AB Attachment styles reflect interpersonal relationship patterns in many ways. Although there is increasing evidence regarding the relationship between attachment styles and suicidality in adults, few studies have been conducted among the elderly population. Present study aims to investigate the link between attachment style and risk of suicidality in elderly people. A secondary analysis of cross-sectional data among geriatric outpatients at psychiatric clinics in Thailand with respect to whether patients had depressive disorders according to DSM-IV by using Mini-Neuropsychiatric Interviews (MINI). MINI-Module C was used to assess suicidality. Other measures included the experience of close relationship questionnaire and a brief cognitive assessment, Mental Status Examination T10. One-hundred and ninety-one elderly people were included, 50.8% females and 119 (62.3%) had depressive disorder. Anxiety attachment predicted suicidality, determined with questions related to the following areas; "want to hurt myself", "suicidal ideation", "suicidal planning", and "suicidal attempted in lifetime". Anxiety attachment style was significantly increased the level of suicide risk. We concluded that high anxious attachment, such as preoccupied attachment style, was associated with suicidality in elderly people. Further investigation focusing on variables associated with attachment and suicidality, particularly depression or anxiety, is warranted.

ID JAPAN; USERS; RISK
AB Introduction and Aims. As a consequence of the methamphetamine epidemic in Thailand, the occurrence of methamphetamine psychosis (MAP) dramatically increased. This study aimed to examine the long-term outcomes of MAP patients following their first presentation to a psychiatric hospital. Design and Methods. Methamphetamine psychosis patients who were first hospitalised in Suan Prung psychiatric hospital Thailand in 2000-2001 were identified through a review of the hospital database. Eligible participants were scheduled for visits by trained field researchers in 2007. For those giving consent, a structured face-to-face interview was conducted. Outcomes were collected from both medical records and interviews. Results. A total of 1116 participants were included in the study. Ninety-two (8.2%) participants had died from suicide, accident or AIDS. Due to relocation, only 449 (40.2%) individuals were interviewed. Most of the participants were male (90.6%) with a mean age of 33.3 years (SD = 8.0). The medical records showed that 263 had revisited the hospital in the interim. Of those, 39.2% were re-hospitalised and 38% were given a diagnosis of schizophrenia due to persistent psychosis. The outreach interview found that more than half (55.7%) had experienced psychosis relapse. Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview revealed the following current conditions: psychotic disorders (15.8%), alcohol use disorders (52.1%) and suicidality (22.3%). Participants who did not have a diagnosis of current methamphetamine abuse could be divided into those with a single episode psychosis (52.6%) and those with chronic course of psychosis (38.8%). Discussion and Conclusions. Individuals with MAP are likely to have poor outcomes, in terms of premature death, several relapses of psychotic symptoms, chronic psychotic manifestation, and very rates of alcohol use disorder and suicidality. Therefore, those individuals with MAP require long-term monitoring and psychiatric care. [Kittirattanapaiboon P, Mahatnirunkul S, Booncharoen H, Thummawomg P, Dumrongchai U, Chutha W.

AB Context: Migration is feared to be associated with abandonment and depression in older parents "left behind" in rural areas of low- and middle-income countries.
   Objective: To test for prospective associations between (1) out-migration of all children and subsequent depression in parents and (2) having a child move back and an improvement in parents' depression.
   Design: A cohort study with a 1-year follow-up.
   Setting: A population-based study nested in a demographic surveillance site of 100 villages in rural Thailand. Most out-migration is to the capital city.
   Participants: A stratified random sample of 1111 parents 60 years and older (1 per household) drawn from all 100 villages, of whom 960 (86%) provided depression data at follow-up.
   Main Outcome Measures: Scoring 6 or more on the Thai version of the EURO-D depression scale at follow-up.
   Results: Depression prevalence was 22%. At baseline, 155 (16%) had all their children migrated from the district and 806 (84%) had at least 1 child living in the district. Having all children out-migrated at baseline, compared with having none or some children out-migrated, predicted a smaller odds of depression, after controlling for baseline sociodemographic and health measures (odds ratio [OR], 0.43; 95% CI, 0.20-0.92). Having a child move back in the study year was associated with greater odds of depression at follow-up when adjusted for baseline measures (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.04-2.94), although this was no longer significant after adjusting for changes in disability and marital status since baseline (OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 0.99-2.98).
   Conclusions: Contrary to our hypothesis, parents whose children are not migrants may be at greater risk of depression than those with migrant children. More understanding is needed about the risks for depression in older rural populations and about the effectiveness of interventions. JAMA Psychiatry. 2013;70(2):226-234.

AB This study was designed to mimic homicide or suicide cases using gasoline. Six adult long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis), weighing between 2.5 to 4.0 kg, were equally divided into control and test groups. The control group was sacrificed by a lethal dose of phenobarbital intracardiac while test group was force fed with two doses of gasoline LD50 (37.7 ml/kg) after sedation with phenobarbital. All carcasses were then placed in a decomposition site to observe the decomposition and invasion process of cadaveric fauna on the carcasses. A total of five decomposition stages were recognized during this study. This study was performed during July 2007. Fresh stage of control and test carcasses occurred between 0 to 15 and 0 to 39 hours of exposure, respectively. The subsequent decomposition stages also exhibited the similar pattern whereby the decomposition process of control carcasses were faster than tested one. The first larvae were found on control carcasses after 9 hours of death while the test group carcasses had only their first blowfly eggs after 15 hours of exposure. Blow flies, Achoetandrus rufifacies and Chrysomya megacephala were the most dominant invader of both carcasses throughout the decaying process. Diptera collected from control carcasses comprised of scuttle fly, Megaselia scalaris and flesh fly, sarcophagid. We concluded that the presence of gasoline and its odor on the carcass had delayed the arrival of insect to the carcasses, thereby slowing down the decomposition process in the carcass by 6 hours.

AB Background Trafficking is a crime of global proportions involving extreme forms of exploitation and abuse. Yet little research has been done of the health risks and morbidity patterns for men, women, and children trafficked for various forms of forced labour.
   Methods We carried out face-to-face interviews with a consecutive sample of individuals entering 15 post-trafficking services in Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam. We asked participants about living and working conditions, experience of violence, and health outcomes. We measured symptoms of anxiety and depression with the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist and post-traumatic stress disorder with the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, and used adjusted logistic regression models to estimate the effect of trafficking on these mental health outcomes, controlling for age, sector of exploitation, and time in trafficking.
   Findings We interviewed 1102 people, of whom 1015 reached work destinations. Participants worked in various sectors including sex work (329 [32%]), fishing (275 [27%]), and factories (136 [13%]). 481 (48%) of 1015 experienced physical violence, sexual violence, or both, with 198 (35%) of 566 women and girls reporting sexual violence. 478 (47%) of 1015 participants were threatened and 198 (20%) were locked in a room. 685 (70%) of 985 who had data available worked 7 days per week and 296 (30%) of 989 worked at least 11 hours per day. 222 (22%) of 983 had a serious injury at work. 61.2% (95% CI 58.2-64.2) of participants reported symptom of depression, 42.8% (39.8-45.9) reported symptoms of anxiety, and 38.9% (36.0-42.0) reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. 5.2% (4.0-6.8) had attempted suicide in the past month. Participants who experienced extremely excessive overtime at work, restricted freedom, bad living conditions, threats, or severe violence were more likely to report symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder.
   Interpretation This is the first health study of a large and diverse sample of men, women, and child survivors of trafficking for various forms of exploitation. Violence and unsafe working conditions were common and psychological morbidity was associated with severity of abuse. Survivors of trafficking need access to health care, especially mental health care. Copyright (C) Kiss et al. Open Access article distributed under the terms of CC BY-NC-ND.

AB IntroductionThis study was to assess differences in the symptom profile of depressive illness across various countries/territories in Asia. The study was a part of the Research on Asia Psychotropic Prescription project. The participating countries/territories include China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand.
   MethodsThe pattern of depressive symptoms in 1,400 subjects with depressive disorder from 42 psychiatric centers in 10 Asian countries/territories was assessed. We collected information on socio-demographic and clinical characteristics with a standardized protocol and data collection procedure.
   ResultsThe most common presentations of depressive symptoms were persistent sadness, loss of interest, and insomnia. Similar findings were found regardless of the region, country, or its income level. Patients with depressive disorder from high-income countries presented significantly more with vegetative symptom cluster (P<0.05), while those from the upper middle-income countries had significantly more with both mood (P<0.001) and cognitive symptom clusters (P<0.01). In lower middle-income countries, patients with depressive symptoms had significantly less mood symptom cluster (P<0.001) but significantly more cognitive symptom cluster (P<0.05).
   DiscussionThis study demonstrates that in Asia, despite variations in the initial symptom reported by the patients, across different countries/territories, core depressive symptoms remain the same. Variations have been found in presentation of depressive symptoms with regards to the level of income of countries. Physical or vegetative symptoms were reported more by centers in higher income countries, while depressive cognition and suicidal thoughts/acts were more frequently reported from lower income countries.

AB Aim: Japanese psychiatrists have increasingly reported patients with depression that does not seem to fit the criteria of the ICD-10 and the DSM-IV, and which has recently been called modern type depression (MTD). We explored whether MTD is frequently seen in Japan and also in other countries, and if so, how patients with MTD are diagnosed and treated.
   Methods: The questionnaires, with two case vignettes (traditional type depression (TTD) and MTD), were sent to psychiatrists in Australia, Bangladesh, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the USA. Participants rated their opinions about each case's prevalence in their country, etiology, diagnosis, suicide risk, and treatment using Likert scales.
   Results: Out of 247 responses (123 from Japan and 124 from other countries), two hundred thirty-nine valid responses were received. MTD was recognized in all participating countries, and especially in urban areas. Generally, the factor of personality was regarded as the most probable cause of MTD. Whereas about 90% of Japanese psychiatrists applied the ICD/DSM criteria to TTD, only about 60% applied the criteria to MID.
   Conclusion: Our results indicate that Japan's MID seems to be occurring in many other countries, and that the present ICD/DSM criteria may not be sufficient to diagnose MID. Therefore, it could be an important candidate for a new international diagnostic criterion as a subtype of depression. A clear diagnostic framework and consensus on the interventions to treat MID would be valuable. Further clinical, psychopathological and international epidemiological studies are needed to confirm our preliminary findings of MID. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Predictors of polypharmacy among elderly Thais with depressive and
   anxiety disorders: findings from the DAS study
SO BMC GERIATRICS

AB BackgroundPolypharmacy is a geriatric syndrome defined variously as the use of potentially inappropriate drugs and/or the concurrent use of multiple medications including prescription and over-the-counter drugs. An association has been shown between polypharmacy and physical health, increased morbidity and increased mortality. However, there is little information regarding the association between polypharmacy and physical disease, personality trait and mental health problems in elderly. The aim of this study was to investigate potential predictive psychosocial factors related to polypharmacy in elderly Thai people.MethodsThe study analysed the secondary data from the Depressive Disorders, Anxiety Disorders, Suicide Risk and Associated Factors Among Elderly Thai People Program (DAS Study) which was funded by National Research Council of Thailand and conducted between January 2012 and April 2013. Demographic and baseline clinical characteristics including sex, age, education, living alone or with others, access to health care privilege and monthly income were described. The number of medication, physical diseases and mental health problems (i.e. depression, anxiety, and personality trait of neuroticism) were analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi-square and proportional odds logistic regression.ResultsThe 803 participants consumed an average of 2.13 prescribed medicines daily (SD 1.46, median=2). The largest group used 3 medications (18.6%). Predictors found to be associated with polypharmacy in the logistic regression model included hypertension (OR=1.985, 95% CI=1.420-2.775), anxiety disorder (OR=4.402, 95% CI=2.630-7.367), number of diseases (OR=2.140, 95% CI=1.874-2.445), depressive disorder (OR=1.470, 95% CI=1.080-2.001), diabetes mellitus (OR=1.864, 95% CI=1.122-3.098) and dyslipidemia (OR=0.511, 95%CI=0.325-0.803).ConclusionsThe prevalence of polypharmacy among Thai elderly was relatively high compared to other related studies. Several aspects should be taken into consideration before starting an additional medication in elderly patients. In addition to the number of physical disease that leads to polypharmacy, general practitioners should be aware of anxiety, depression, and personality trait of neuroticism that may be related to polypharmacy. Early detection for such condition as well as non-pharmacological intervention could be one way to help reduce polypharmacy in the elderly.

TI Varenicline A Novel Pharmacotherapy for Smoking Cessation
SO DRUGS
LA English
DT Review
ID RECEPTOR PARTIAL AGONIST; SUSTAINED-RELEASE BUPROPION;
   ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; DOSE PHARMACOKINETICS; COST-EFFECTIVENESS;
   CONTROLLED TRIAL; IN-VIVO; PLACEBO; ALPHA-4-BETA-2; THERAPY
AB Varenicline is an orally administered small molecule with partial agonist activity at the alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Varenicline was approved by both the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency of the EU in 2006 as an aid to smoking cessation. Subsequently, varenicline has been approved in over 80 other countries.
   Varenicline is almost entirely absorbed following oral administration, and absorption is unaffected by food, smoking or the time of day. Varenicline undergoes only minimal metabolism and approximately 90% of the drug is excreted in the urine unchanged. Varenicline has a mean elimination half-life after repeated administration of approximately 24 hours in smokers. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve is increased in patients with moderate or severe renal failure. No clinically relevant varenicline-drug interactions have been identified.
   In two identical, randomized, double-blind, phase III clinical trials in healthy, motivated-to-quit, mainly Caucasian smokers aged 18-75 years in the US, 12 weeks of treatment with varenicline I mg twice daily was associated with significantly higher abstinence rates over weeks 9-12 than sustained-release bupropion 150mg twice daily or placebo. In a separate phase III trial, an additional 12 weeks of treatment in smokers achieving abstinence in the first 12 weeks was associated with greater abstinence through to week 52 than placebo treatment. Varenicline treatment was also associated with significantly higher rates of abstinence than placebo treatment in randomized, double-blind, clinical trials in smokers in China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. In a randomized, open-label, multi-national, phase III trial, varenicline treatment was associated with a significantly higher rate of abstinence than transdermal nicotine-replacement therapy. In these trials, varenicline treatment was associated with lower urge to smoke and satisfaction from smoking in relapsers than placebo or active comparators.
   In the two US phase III trials, 12 weeks of treatment with varenicline I mg twice daily had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. Nausea and abnormal dreams were the most common adverse events that occurred in more varenicline than placebo recipients. The incidence and prevalence of nausea were greatest in weeks I and 2 of treatment, and declined thereafter. The prevalence of early adverse effects can be reduced by individual dose titration. Adverse events associated with varenicline therapy have been reported in post-marketing surveillance, including neuropsychiatric events such as depressed mood, agitation, changes in behaviour, suicidal ideation and suicide. Currently, it is unclear whether the association of varenicline therapy with these adverse events is causal, coincidental or related to smoking cessation.
   Given the greater efficacy of varenicline compared with other pharmacotherapies, and the high risk of morbidity and mortality associated with continued smoking, varenicline is a valuable pharmacological aid to smoking cessation.
