TI Suicide in the Philippines: time trend analysis (1974-2005) and
   literature review
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Review
ID RATES; MORTALITY; THAILAND
AB Background: Suicide prevention is given a low priority in many Western Pacific countries due to competing health problems, stigma and poor understanding of its incidence and aetiology. Little is known about the epidemiology of suicide and suicidal behaviour in the Philippines and although its incidence is reported to be low, there is likely to be under-reporting because of its non-acceptance by the Catholic Church and the associated stigma to the family. This study aims to investigate trends in the incidence of suicide in the Philippines, assess possible underreporting and provide information on the methods used and the reasons for suicide.
   Methods: Data for suicide deaths occurring between 1974 and 2005 were obtained from Philippine Health Statistics. Age- and sex-specific trends were examined graphically. Underreporting was investigated by comparing trends in suicides, accidents and deaths of undetermined intent. To provide a fuller picture of suicide in the Philippines, a comprehensive search for published papers, theses and reports on the epidemiology of suicide in the Philippines was undertaken.
   Results: The incidence of suicide in males increased from 0.23 to 3.59 per 100,000 between 1984 and 2005. Similarly, rates rose from 0.12 to 1.09 per 100,000 in females. Amongst females, suicide rates were highest in 15-24 year olds, whilst in males rates were similar in all age groups throughout the study period. The most commonly used methods of suicide were hanging, shooting and organophosphate ingestion. In non-fatal attempts, the most common methods used were ingestion of drugs, specifically isoniazid and paracetamol, or organophosphate ingestion. Family and relationship problems were the most common precipitants. While rates were lower compared to other countries, there is suggestive evidence of underreporting and misclassification to undetermined injury. Recent increases may reflect either true increase or better reporting of suicides.
   Conclusions: While suicide rates are low in the Philippines, increases in incidence and relatively high rates in adolescents and young adults point to the importance of focused suicide prevention programs. Improving data quality and better reporting of suicide deaths is likewise imperative to inform and evaluate prevention strategies.

DT Article
DE Terrorism; Philippines; Mindanao; ISIS; suicide bombing
AB The siege of Marawi City in 2017 by militants flying the black flag of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) was one of the most significant events in the development of militant Islamism in Southeast Asia. The devastation of the attack, however, was followed by a major breakthrough in the peace process in the Southern Philippines with the formation in early 2019 of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). The consequences of these two major events represent a critical juncture in the conflict in Mindanao in which the pattern of militant Islamism is highly fluid. Surveying the situation in Mindanao post-Marawi siege, this article argues that, in parallel to the decline of ISIS in the Middle East, the conflict in Mindanao is undergoing a transitional phase in which the dominant pattern of militant Islamism is shifting from one of insurgency to clandestine terrorism, characterized by a protean network of small but more ruthless groups. This development is marked by the emergence for the first time ever of suicide bombings in the Philippines. If suicide bombing becomes normalized in the Philippines as the most desperate tactic of a decentralized terrorist network, it will present a formidable new challenge to both the Philippine state and the nascent autonomous government in Muslim Mindanao.

AB The aim of this study was to assess the level of suicide attempts in three school-based samples of Southeast Asian adolescents (Taipei, Taiwan; the Philippines; Chiang Mai, Thailand) and determine whether adolescent suicide attempters score higher on measures of hopelessness and loneliness relative to nonattempters. It was hypothesized that hopelessness and loneliness would be related to suicide attempts, and that hopelessness would continue to be associated with suicide attempts when controlling for loneliness. The prevalence of suicide attempts across the three samples of Asian youth were not consistent with Taiwanese girls and boys as the most likely to have ever attempted suicide. As expected, results showed that suicide attempters (in past 12 months and ever) scored higher on hopelessness and loneliness than nonattempters across all three samples and for both genders. However, the statistical control of loneliness demonstrably weakened the association between suicide attempt behaviour and hopelessness across the samples and for both genders, and resulted in nonsignificant ANCOVA tests for some of the sample-gender groups.

This article reviews three episodes from Muslim history: the Assassins of Syria and Persia, juramentado in the Philippines, and Husayn's martyrdom at Karbala, Each of these episodes manifests a different symbolic stratagem: the neutralization of transition anxiety, the sacrificial fusion of murder and suicide, and the justifying projection of the past onto the present.

AB Using archival data from a national survey of N=8,891 young Filipina women ages 15 to 24, this paper aimed to examine links between sexual-minority status and thinking about and attempting suicide. Similar to previous results from young Filipino men and to findings in the global LGBT mental health literature, sexual-minority status was associated with both suicide ideation and suicide attempt across measures of same-sex attraction and same-sex romantic relationships. Sexual-minority Filipina youth had higher odds of having thought about suicide and having attempted suicide, compared to heterosexual peers. Following a minority stress framework, this paper explored a number of correlates of suicide ideation and attempt, including normative risk factors such as depression, recent suicide attempt of a friend, and experiences of threat and victimization.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify associations between suicide ideation and indicators of psychological distress and health behaviors in Chinese and Philippine adolescents. Method: Global School Health Surveys consisting of 9015 Chinese and 7338 Philippine students aged 11 to 17 years were analyzed using logistic regression to determine demographic, psychosocial, and health/risk behavioral determinants of suicide ideation. Results: In both samples, suicide ideation was associated with substance use, physical activity, feelings of loneliness, hopelessness/sadness, and worrying. Chinese girls were more likely to than boys to report suicide ideation and suicide planning, whereas Philippine girls were more likely to report suicide planning. Overweight status and sedentary behaviors were associated with increased risk of suicide ideation in Chinese adolescents, but the same influences were observed to be protective for Philippine adolescents. Conclusions: Psychosocial, demographic, and health/risk behaviors factors appear to impact suicide ideation and suicide planning in both of these youth populations.

AB Purpose
   This study examined trends in the suicide rates of persons with foreign background in Japan.
   Methods
   Using the nationwide death records in the Vital Statistics of Japan, we first reported the age-adjusted suicide rates of 8 foreign nationals (Brazil, China, Korea, Peru, the Philippines, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States) in Japan by sex from 1980 to the mid-2010s. We also computed rate ratios to compare the suicide rate of each group with those of the Japanese population. Second, we focused on Koreans, who had the highest suicide rate in Japan. We compared the suicide rates of Koreans in Japan with Koreans in South Korea to examine whether their suicide rates were more closely related to those of their country of origin or those of their host country.
   Results
   We found that the suicide rates of Koreans and Chinese in Japan were similar to or higher than those of Japanese, while other groups tended to show lower suicide rates. Most notably, Koreans displayed consistently high suicide rates from 1980 to the mid-2010s, which were nearly twice as high as those of the Japanese population. Korean males and females in Japan had higher suicide rates than those in South Korea.
   Conclusions
   Immigrants in Japan were not necessarily influenced by the suicide rates of the host country. The high suicide rates among Korean residents in Japan might be explained by various disadvantages and adversities that they face in Japan.

AB Background: A number of Delphi expert consensus studies have been carried out with different countries and cultural groups to develop guidelines on how a member of the public should provide assistance to a person who is suicidal. The present study aimed to determine whether cross-culturally generalizable suicide first aid actions are possible by comparing agreement across these Delphi studies.
   Methods: Data on endorsement rates for items were compared across six Delphi studies. These studies involved panels of professionals and consumer advocates from English-speaking countries, professionals from Sri Lanka, professionals from Japan, professionals from India, professionals from the Philippines, and professionals and consumer advocates in refugee and immigrant mental health. Correlations were calculated between item endorsement rates across panels.
   Results: There were 18 items that were highly endorsed across all eight of the Delphi panels and an additional 15 items highly endorsed across the panels from the three lower middle-income countries (India, Philippines and Sri Lanka). Correlations across panels in item endorsement rates were all 0.60 or above, but were higher between panels from countries that are socioeconomically similar.
   Conclusions: There is broad agreement across the diverse expert panels about what are appropriate suicide first aid actions for members of the public, indicating that cross-cultural generalizability is possible. However, there is also some cultural specificity, indicating the need for local tailoring.

AB BackgroundGlobally, suicide is a significant cause of death among adolescents. Previous studies conducted in high-income countries suggest that students in alternative schools are more likely to engage in suicidal behaviors than those in formal schools. This study aimed to document suicidal ideation and behaviors among adolescent learners enrolled in the Alternative Learning System (ALS) in Manila, Philippines.MethodsA mixed methods study was conducted in 24 ALS centers in the city of Manila. ALS centers were stratified according to congressional district and selected using probability proportionate sampling. A cross-sectional survey to determine attitudes towards suicide and prevalence of suicidal ideation and behaviors was administered to 171 learners aged 13 to 17years old. In-depth interviews with 18 teachers and 12 learners were conducted to explore the school psychosocial environment's role on learners' suicidal ideation and behaviors. Exploratory factor analysis was used to extract attitude factors. Fisher's exact test and Student's t-test were used to identify differences in sociodemographic characteristics and attitudes towards suicide between learners with or without suicidal ideation or behaviors. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis.ResultsNon-specific active thoughts were the most common type of lifetime suicidal ideation (40.9%) while passive ideation was the most common in the past month (13.5%). Aborted suicide attempt was the most frequent behavior in both lifetime (16.4%) and in the past month (4.7%). Non-fatal suicide attempt in the past month was 2.3%, reaching 12.9% for the entire lifetime. Age, sex, education, and attitudes towards suicide were significantly associated with suicidal ideation or behavior. Thematic analysis showed five themes: (1) fostering belongingness, (2) securing learners' safety, (3) teaching philosophy, (4) teacher and learner beliefs towards suicidal behavior, and (5) availability of school-offered and community-based services.ConclusionSuicidal ideation and behaviors are prevalent among adolescent ALS learners. This study also showed a significant difference in attitudes towards suicide and sociodemographic characteristics between learners with and without suicidal ideation behaviors. It also suggests that the school psychosocial environment, through social norms and learner-teacher interactions, can potentially prevent progression of suicidal ideation to behavior, influence help-seeking, and promote mental health among learners.

AB The prevalence of mental health problems has become alarming, with the worldwide occurrence of mental health problems and deaths due to suicide reaching significant numbers. In the Philippines, suicide rate has increased from 1984 to 2005 especially among the youth. This is evident in campus setting in the Philippines, with the death of at least ten college students in the past three years. Despite this prevalence, many of those experiencing mental health problems do not seek help because of factors such as inaccessibility of help and the stigma and discrimination brought by mental health conditions. Using insights collected from a series of consultations with the campus' counseling center, administrators, faculty, and students of the University of the Philippines Manila, this project designed and developed a mobile application which will provide a more convenient and accessible mental health first aid service to students that helps them avoid stigma and discrimination. The application connects students with trained peer counselors, while at the same time, protecting their anonymity through safeguards. It also collects data regarding the frequency of the software's use and the demographics of active users, which can be used in understanding the mental health status of each campus. The project shows potential not only in providing mental health intervention, but also in studying and preventing mental illnesses in college campuses.

AB This article reviews research into suicide in women during the last 25 years. National rates vary between the extremes of 19/10(5) per year in Sri Lanka and < 1/10(5) per year in the Philippines and Egypt, but almost everywhere rates for women are much lower than male retest with a median ratio of 2.8/1. The exceptions are in India and China, which report higher rates in young married women. The reproductive process has some influence. While menstruation, hormonal treatment, pregnancy and the puerperium have no major effect, unwanted pregnancy may still lead to suicide under certain circumstances, and severe labour can occasionally do so. Having children protects, but the relative risk is no more than 2.0 in nulliparous women. Social factors also have a limited effect. There are higher rates of suicide in divorced women, but the evidence on widowhood is equivocal. Prosperity and employment have no effect. Sexual abuse, rape and domestic violence undoubtedly lead to suicide attempts, but the evidence on completed suicide is lacking. There are many unanswered questions, especially why rates of completed suicide for women (with a greater prevalence of overt depression) are lower than for men, and why Chinese and Indian women have higher rates. More research is required, especially from developing nations.

AB Background
   Suicides by carbon monoxide poisoning resulting from burning barbecue charcoal reached epidemic levels in Hong Kong and Taiwan within 5 y of the first reported cases in the early 2000s. The objectives of this analysis were to investigate (i) time trends and regional patterns of charcoal-burning suicide throughout East/Southeast Asia during the time period 1995-2011 and (ii) whether any rises in use of this method were associated with increases in overall suicide rates. Sex- and age-specific trends over time were also examined to identify the demographic groups showing the greatest increases in charcoal-burning suicide rates across different countries.
   Methods and Findings
   We used data on suicides by gases other than domestic gas for Hong Kong, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore in the years 1995/1996-2011. Similar data for Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand were also extracted but were incomplete. Graphical and joinpoint regression analyses were used to examine time trends in suicide, and negative binomial regression analysis to study sex- and age-specific patterns. In 1995/1996, charcoal-burning suicides accounted for <1% of all suicides in all study countries, except in Japan (5%), but they increased to account for 13%, 24%, 10%, 7%, and 5% of all suicides in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore, respectively, in 2011. Rises were first seen in Hong Kong after 1998 (95% CI 1997-1999), followed by Singapore in 1999 (95% CI 1998-2001), Taiwan in 2000 (95% CI 1999-2001), Japan in 2002 (95% CI 1999-2003), and the Republic of Korea in 2007 (95% CI 2006-2008). No marked increases were seen in Malaysia, the Philippines, or Thailand. There was some evidence that charcoal-burning suicides were associated with an increase in overall suicide rates in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan (for females), but not in Japan (for males), the Republic of Korea, and Singapore. Rates of change in charcoal-burning suicide rate did not differ by sex/age group in Taiwan and Hong Kong but appeared to be greatest in people aged 15-24 y in Japan and people aged 25-64 y in the Republic of Korea. The lack of specific codes for charcoal-burning suicide in the International Classification of Diseases and variations in coding practice in different countries are potential limitations of this study.
   Conclusions
   Charcoal-burning suicides increased markedly in some East/Southeast Asian countries (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore) in the first decade of the 21st century, but such rises were not experienced by all countries in the region. In countries with a rise in charcoal-burning suicide rates, the timing, scale, and sex/age pattern of increases varied by country. Factors underlying these variations require further investigation, but may include differences in culture or in media portrayals of the method.

   Editors' Summary
   Editors' Summary
   Background
   Every year, almost one million people die by suicide globally; suicide is the fifth leading cause of death in women aged 15-49 and the sixth leading cause of death in men in the same age group. Most people who take their own life are mentally ill. For others, stressful events (the loss of a partner, for example) have made life seem worthless or too painful to bear.
   Strategies to reduce suicide rates include better treatment of mental illness and programs that help people at high risk of suicide deal with stress. Suicide rates can also be reduced by limiting access to common suicide methods. These methods vary from place to place. Hanging is the predominant suicide method in many countries, but in Hong Kong, for example, jumping from a high building is the most common method. Suicide methods also vary over time. For example, after a woman in Hong Kong took her life in 1998 by burning barbecue charcoal in a sealed room (a process that produces the toxic gas carbon monoxide), charcoal burning rapidly went from being a rare method of killing oneself in Hong Kong to the second most common suicide method.
   Why Was This Study Done? ?
   Cases of charcoal-burning suicide have also been reported in several East and Southeast Asian countries, but there has been no systematic investigation of time trends and regional patterns of this form of suicide. A better understanding of regional changes in the number of charcoal-burning suicides might help to inform efforts to prevent the emergence of other new suicide methods. Here, the researchers investigate the time trends and regional patterns of charcoal-burning suicide in several countries in East and Southeast Asia between 1995 and 2011 and ask whether any rises in the use of this method are associated with increases in overall suicide rates. The researchers also investigate sex- and age-specific time trends in charcoal-burning suicides to identify which groups of people show the greatest increases in this form of suicide across different countries.
   What Did the Researchers Do and Find? ?
   The researchers analyzed method-specific data on suicide deaths for Hong Kong, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore between 1995/1996 and 2011 obtained from the World Health Organization Mortality Database and from national death registers. In 1995/1996, charcoal-burning suicides accounted for less than 1% of all suicides in all these countries except Japan (4.9%). By 2011, charcoal-burning suicides accounted for between 5% (Singapore) and 24% (Taiwan) of all suicides. Rises in the rate of charcoal-burning suicide were first seen in Hong Kong in 1999, in Singapore in 2000, in Taiwan in 2001, in Japan in 2003, and in the Republic of Korea in 2008. By contrast, incomplete data from Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand showed no evidence of a marked increase in charcoal-burning suicide in these countries over the same period. Charcoal-burning suicides were associated with an increase in overall suicide rates in Hong Kong in 1998-2003, in Taiwan in 2000-2006, and in Japanese women after 2003. Finally, the annual rate of change in charcoal-burning suicide rate did not differ by sex/age group in Taiwan and Hong Kong, whereas in Japan people aged 15-24 and in the Republic of Korea people aged 25-64 tended to have the greatest rates of increase.
   What Do These Findings Mean? ?
   These findings show that charcoal-burning suicides increased markedly in several but not all East and Southeast Asian countries during the first decade of the 21st century. Moreover, in countries where there was an increase, the timing, scale, and sex/age pattern of the increase varied by country. The accuracy of these findings is likely to be limited by several aspects of the study.
   For example, because of the way that method-specific suicides are recorded in the World Health Organization Mortality Database and national death registries, the researchers may have slightly overestimated the number of charcoal-burning suicides. Further studies are now needed to identify the factors that underlie the variations between countries in charcoal-burning suicide rates and time trends reported here. However, the current findings highlight the need to undertake surveillance to identify the emergence of new suicide methods and the importance of policy makers, the media, and internet service providers working together to restrict graphic and detailed descriptions of new suicide methods.

TI Working (wo)man's suicide: transnational relocations of capital -
   repercussions for labour in South Korea and the Philippines
SO JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL ANTHROPOLOGICAL INSTITUTE
LA English
DT Article
ID ANTHROPOLOGY; RISK
AB In South Korea, 2011 was marked by the rise of a social movement against precarity, the emergence of which was dependent upon effective and affective mobilizing strategies amongst workers. The impetus was provided by a struggle at a shipyard in Pusan, where an activist held a crane occupied for 309 days. The role of affect in constituting neoliberal workplaces has recently received much attention in anthropology. The question of how emotions figure into the mobilizing efforts of labour, rather than those of management, however, has been overlooked. Hope and despair are two emotive themes amongst activists involved in the Hanjin dispute that are closely linked to the practice of suicide amongst unionized workers in the country. Since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, suicide has also become an all-too-ordinary response to pressures imposed upon an increasingly precarious Korean workforce. I look into the affective mobilizing cultures that have allowed the Hope Bus' movement to excel in Korea, and explore the less successful efforts that were made by Korean and Filipino activists to link up their struggles.

AB The purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship between adolescent substance use and psychosocial distress indicators among 30,851 adolescents aged 11 to 16 in four countries (Philippines, China, Chile, and Namibia). Global School-Based Student Health Survey data from these countries provided information about frequency and lifetime use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs as well as items about early adolescents' feelings of loneliness, worry, hopelessness, suicide, and number of close friends. Overall, there were significant relationships between adolescent substance-use behaviors and a measure of "global" psychosocial distress for both boys and girls in all four countries and for four of the five items of psychosocial distress (often lonely, often worry, sad/hopeless, and having a suicide plan). The association between substance use and psychosocial distress was also consistent in both genders and across the four countries. These results have important implications for professionals who work with adolescent populations.

ID SUICIDE IDEATION; CONSEQUENCES
AB Aim: The study aimed to assess the associations between substance use early initiation (<12 years) (smoking cigarettes, alcohol and drug use) with psychological distress among adolescents in five ASEAN countries.
   Methods: Cross-sectional data were analysed from 33,184 school adolescents, with a median age of 14 years, from Indonesia, Laos, Philippines, Thailand and Timor-Leste that took part in the "Global School-Based Student Health Survey (GSHS)" in 2015.
   Results: The overall prevalence of pre-adolescent (<12 years) cigarette use was 10.6%, 8.1% pre-adolescent current alcohol use, and 4.2% pre-adolescent drug use initiation. In adjusted multinomial logistic regression analysis, pre-adolescent initiation of cigarette smoking, pre-adolescent initiation of alcohol use, pre-adolescent initiation of drug use and multi-substance pre-adolescent initiation were highly associated with medium (=1) and high (=2-5) psychological distress (of five psychological distress items: no close friends, loneliness, anxiety, suicidal ideation and suicide attempt). Late initiation of cigarette use and late initiation of drug use were not associated with medium and/or high psychological distress.
   Conclusion: Early prevention programmes should target concurrent early substance use initiation in order to prevent possible subsequent psychological distress.

AB OBJECTIVE: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established treatment modality for Parkinson disease (PD). The first DBS for PD in the Philippines was performed at the Philippine Movement Disorder Surgery Center in 2006. There are no Philippine data on DBS for PD. We aim to determine the motor improvement and reduction in medication dosage of all patients with PD who underwent DBS at the Philippine Movement Disorder Surgery Center.
   METHODS: This is a retrospective study of all patients with PD (n = 17) who underwent DBS from 2006 to 2016. The change in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor and levodopa equivalent dose were determined.
   RESULTS: There was a statistically significant reduction in the UPDRS motor in all patients off medication at 3 months (48.2%; P = 0.004), 1 year (47.3%; P = 0.026), 2 years (48.4%; P = 0.021), and 3 years (66.0%; P = 0.032) after DBS and on medication at 3 months (43.3%; P = 0.023), 6 months (24.7%; P = 0.053), and 1 year (38.1%; P = 0.033). A significant reduction in the dosage of PD medications was also seen until the second year of followup (52.3%; P < 0.001). Adverse events included an attempted suicide and a device-related infection.
   CONCLUSIONS: DBS for PD improves the UPDRS motor score in the off-medication and on-medication state, with the maximal benefit seen at 3 years after surgery and reduces PD medication dosage by half. Although the benefit from DBS is undeniable, the high cost of the procedure precludes more patients from benefitting from it. There is a need for government support to expand access to DBS.

AB Depression can be prevented if its symptoms are addressed early and effectively. Prevention against depression among university students is rare in the Philippines, but is urgent because of the rising rates of suicide among the group. Evidence is needed to systematically identify and assist students with higher levels of depressive symptoms. We carried out a survey to determine the social and demographic factors associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms among 2,436 Filipino university students. The University Students Depression Inventory with measures on lethargy, cognition-emotion, and academic motivation, was used. Six of the 11 factors analyzed were found to be statistically significantly associated with more intense levels of depressive symptoms. These factors were: frequency of smoking, frequency of drinking, not living with biological parents, dissatisfaction with one's financial condition, level of closeness with parents, and level of closeness with peers. Sex, age category, course category, year level and religion were not significantly related. In identifying students with greater risk for depression, characteristics related to lifestyle, financial condition, parents and peers are crucial. There is a need to carry out more surveys to develop the pool of local knowledge on student depression.

AB The study aimed to assess the relationship between bullying victimization and adverse health or psychosocial problems among in-school adolescents from five Southeast Asian countries. The sample consisted of 33,184 school-going children, mean age 14.6 years (SD = 1.7), from Indonesia, Laos, Philippines, Thailand and Timor-Leste that took part in the cross-sectional "Global School-based Student Health Survey" (GSHS) in 2015. Results indicate 18.6% of the students reported infrequent (1-2 days/month) and 12.0% frequent (3-30 days/month) past-month bullying victimization. Among different types of bullying victimization, the most prevalent was psychological (13.5%), followed by other (5.6%), physical (3.6%) and social (1.3%). In adjusted Poisson regression analysis, bullying victimization is associated with tobacco, alcohol and drug use, physically attacked, in physical fight, injury, truancy and poor hand hygiene behaviour, anxiety, loneliness, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, no close friends, sedentary behaviour, underweight and overweight or obesity. This study extends previous findings from mainly high-income countries on the relationship between bullying victimization and a large number of adverse outcomes in adolescents in Southeast Asia.

ID STEM BORERS
AB The rice white stemborer ( WSB) Scirpophaga innotata ( Walker) supplanted the closely related rice yellow stemborer ( YSB) S. incertulas ( Walker) in irrigated, double- rice culture in both Koronadal, South Cotabato, Philippines and Java, Indonesia. In Java, WSB became a serious pest but not in Koronadal where damage levels remained unchanged. The species shift and subsequent outbreaks are seen as independent events. The former occurred just after the El Nino droughts in 1982 1983 which suggests that climatic factors triggered the demise of YSB which does not aestivate. A contributing factor may have also been the crop failures from pest outbreaks that occurred during the same period creating long fallows which would have allowed WSB larvae selectively to survive. WSB larvae have been known to diapause for up to 10 - 12 months and consequently is able to survive climatically driven long fallows. Diapause is terminated by rainfall > 10mm after larvae have rested for a minimum of 4 months. Supportive evidence in favour of climate as the causal agent of change is that the distribution of WSB in Asia and Oceania overlaps that of the Intertropical Convergence Zone of the Southern Oscillation. YSB on the other hand is more adapted to a monsoon climate. It is also hypothesised that WSB, normally associated with single- crop, rainfed- rice culture, was able to adapt to double- cropped, irrigated culture due to the introduction of early maturing rices. From what is known about rice stemborer ecology, five cultural practices and natural events were postulated as the reasons keeping WSB densities in check in Koronadal: ( 1) medium maturing varieties to reduce the dry season fallow, ( 2) low inorganic N levels, ( 3) natural enemies, ( 4) destruction of crop residue harbouring larvae and pupae during land preparation, and ( 5) rainfall in the dry season causing suicide flights. Control strategies for areas where WSB is a pest should be based on: ( 1) reducing the fallow period by growing longer maturing varieties and ( 2) undertaking early ploughing for the wet season crop.

AB Post-disaster reconstruction projects in areas with high pre-disaster vulnerabilities can lead to both temporary and permanent resettlement outcomes. During this complex process, efforts are centred to the provision of housing and basic infrastructure. In general, the limited land available restricts opportunities for high-quality spatial design within the settlements to optimize the land and provide the maximum number of houses possible. Open spaces in these settlements are rarely considered during the planning and implementation of the projects, and consequently there is little scholarship of community space. However, the importance of open spaces to the community and the liveability of these new settlements depend on the interactions which spontaneously take place in these areas. This study explores the different uses and characteristics of open spaces in temporary and permanent resettlement sites established in the aftermath of major disasters in Japan and the Philippines. This study addresses the limitations of the immediate post-disaster urban planning, compared to the longer-term urban space that emerges spontaneously in an attempt by the residents to improve their community. It was observed that the planning of open and public spaces was not a priority for the governments and the other stakeholders involved in settlement design. Despite these compromises, this study reveals that resettled communities appreciate any available open spaces and transform these spaces to accommodate their needs and cultural preferences reflecting their vital role as urban elements for convergence of the multiple sociocultural activities towards the recovery and revitalization of the disaster-affected communities.

AB Studies in Western societies have shown some evidence that growth in early life may be associated with suicide and suicidal ideation in later life. The pattern of growth retardation in developing countries is different from that in Western societies. This study examines the association between size at birth, postnatal growth from birth to age 24 months and suicidal ideation in 18-year-old Filipinos. The 1941 participants born in 1983 and 1984 in the Philippines were assessed for growth status bimonthly from birth to 24 months of age and were administered an interview in 2002, which included items on suicidal ideation.
   The pattern of growth stunting in this cohort was similar to that in many other developing countries: a minor level of shortness in crown-heel length at birth followed by sharp decline in length-for-age in the first 24 months of life. The prevalence of suicidal ideation at age 18 was 2.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.2, 3.8%. Length Z-score at 24 months (odds ratios [OR] = 0.67; 95% CI [0.52, 0.86]; P = 0.002) and gain in length Z-score from birth to age 24 months (OR = 0.74; 95% CI [0.56, 0.98]; P = 0.037) were inversely associated with the odds of suicidal ideation. Adjustment for covariates made little difference. Length at birth Z-score was associated with suicidal ideation only after adjustment for postnatal length gain (OR = 0.61; 95% CI [0.46, 0.80]; P < 0.001). The associations between linear growth in early life and suicidal ideation appeared to be partly mediated by educational attainment. In conclusion, postnatal growth stunting is an important predictor of suicidal ideation in later life. It also affects the association between birth length and suicidal ideation.
