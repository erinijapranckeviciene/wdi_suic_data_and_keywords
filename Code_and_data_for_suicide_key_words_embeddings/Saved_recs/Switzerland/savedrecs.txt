AB Assisting suicide is legal in Switzerland if it is offered without selfish motive to a person with decision-making capacity. Although the Swiss model' for suicide assistance has been extensively described in the literature, the formally and informally protected liberties and claims of assistors and recipients of suicide assistance in Switzerland are incompletely captured in the literature. In this article, we describe the package of rights involved in the Swiss model' using the framework of Hohfeldian rights as modified by Wenar. After outlining this framework, we dissect the rights involved in suicide assistance in Switzerland, and compare it with the situation in England and Germany. Based on this approach, we conclude that in Switzerland, claim rights exist for those requesting suicide assistance, and for those who are considering providing such assistance, even though no entitlements exist toward suicide assistance. We then describe the implementation of the Swiss model' and difficulties arising within it. Clarifying these issues is important to understand the Swiss situation, to evaluate what features of it may or may not be worth correcting or emulating, and to understand how it can impact requests for suicide assistance in other countries due to suicide tourism'. It is also important to understand exactly what sets Switzerland apart from other countries with different legislations regarding suicide assistance.

AB The objective of this study was to estimate the potential of method restriction as a public health strategy in suicide prevention. Data from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office and the Swiss Institutes of Forensic Medicine from 2004 were gathered and categorized into suicide submethods according to accessibility to restriction of means. Of suicides in Switzerland, 39.2% are accessible to method restriction. The highest proportions were found in private weapons (13.2%), army weapons (10.4%), and jumps from hot-spots (4.6%). The presented method permits the estimation of the suicide prevention potential of a country by method restriction and the comparison of restriction potentials between suicide methods. In Switzerland, reduction of firearm suicides has the highest potential to reduce the total number of suicides.

ID MURDER-SUICIDE; EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Homicide followed by the suicide of the offender is a well-known phenomenon. In most cases, it takes place in the context of the so-called "family tragedies." A recent series of such family tragedies in Switzerland prompted an intensive debate in the media and the Swiss government concerning the Swiss Weapon Law, in particular the requirement to keep personal army weapons at home.
   The present study of Homicide-Suicide cases in Switzerland, thus focuses on the role played by guns, especially military weapons, in such crimes.
   We investigated retrospectively 75 cases of Homicide-Suicide, comprising 172 individuals and spanning a period of 23 years in western and central Switzerland.
   Our results show that if guns were used in 76% of the cases, army weapons were the cause of death in 25% of the total. In 28% of the deaths caused by a gunshot, the exact type of the gun and its origin could not be determined.
   Thus, the majority of Homicide-Suicide cases in Switzerland involve the use of guns. The exact percentage of cases were military weapons were involved could not be defined. In our opinion, a stricter weapons law, restricting access to firearms, would be a factor of prevention of Homicide- Suicide cases in Switzerland.

LA English
DT Review
DE assisted suicide; Switzerland; debate
ID EUTHANASIA
AB Assisted suicide is allowed in 3 states of the United States (Oregon, Washington, Montana) but only if performed by a physician.
   On the opposite, in Switzerland, at the beginning of the 20th century, the Swiss Penal Code referred to assisted suicide in the context of honor or an unhappy love affair. It was only in 1985 that Exit Deutsche Schweiz (Exit for German-speaking Switzerland) "medically'' assisted the first patient to end his life.
   Even if authorized by the Swiss law upon certain conditions, assisted suicide is subject to debates for ethical reasons. The Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences described directives to guide physicians on this difficult subject.
   Different studies showed an increase in the number of medical-assisted suicide in Switzerland since the 1990s. Now, this number seems to be quite stable. Assisted suicide is authorized in a few hospitals under strict conditions (especially when returning home is impossible).
   Thus, according to the Swiss law, any person could perform assisted suicide; this is essentially performed by 3 main associations, using pentobarbital on medical prescription as lethal substance.
   Generally speaking, the Swiss population is rather in favor of assisted suicide. Among politics, the debate has been tough until 2010, when the Federal Council decided not to modify the Swiss Penal Code concerning assisted suicide.

AB Current research is yielding an increasingly heteregeneous picture of suicide seasonalities: They seem to depend on methods and, moreover, they seem to have smoothed in recent decades. This work examines the latter issue by comparing suicide seasonalities in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland, in the 16(th)-18(th) centuries, 1901-1920 and 1969-94. The results indicate shifts of peaks and lows on suicide seasonalities over the centuries, with a smoothing of seasonalities toward the 21(th) century. The recent period does not show any suicide seasonality at all. The canton of Zurich seems to be ahead of the general trend found in other regions of Switzerland.

TI Tobacco and alcohol tax relationships with suicide in Switzerland
SO PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB Previous research has shown an empirical link between tobacco and alcohol use and suicide. If tobacco and alcohol use contribute to suicidal behaviors, then policies designed to reduce the tobacco and alcohol consumption may succeed in reducing suicides as well. To test this hypothesis, correlations for suicide rates with alcohol consumption, taxes on alcohol and tobacco in Switzerland were examined using sets of time-series data from Switzerland in 1965-1994. The tax on tobacco correlated significantly negatively with male standardized suicide rate. The tax on alcohol also correlated significantly with male standardized suicide rate in an autoregressive model. On the other hand, significant relationships with female suicide rate were not found. Policies designed to reduce tobacco consumption are consistent with a benefit of reducing suicides, particularly for men in this sample.

The first part of the article presents and discusses the activities of Stop Suicide and its national context, characterized by an absence of a general national suicide prevention program. The second part specifically focuses on the evaluation of Stop Suicide, based on interviews with the members of the association's network. The evaluation reported an assessment carried out regarding the members' general perceptions about the association and its collaborations. The article suggests the possibility of creating a branch for coordinating regional suicide prevention, and it highlights the need to evaluate the impact and effects of the activities on the population concerned, youth.

LA English
DT Article
DE suicide; homicide; army weapon; firearm; suicide prevention
ID RATES
AB Objectives: Switzerland has one of the highest rates of firearm suicides in the world. International studies show a positive correlation between the rate of households with guns and femicides with guns. Because its defense system requires a militia to keep personal firearms at home, Switzerland has a high rate of households with a gun. Methods: Records of suicides in the region of Basel between 1992 and 1996 were reviewed. Suicides with either army weapons or private firearms and suicides by other means were compared. Methods and types of homicides that occurred in the region at the same time were also analyzed. Findings: Firearm suicides were clearly the most frequent means of suicide. They were also used in 30.0% of domestic homicides, although,other means were used at similar rates. Firearms for suicide were mainly used by men, especially army-weapons. These men were younger, professionally better qualified, and fewer had ever been treated in one of the local state psychiatric services. Discussion: The use of firearms for suicide, rather than homicide, and particularly of army weapons by young, well-educated men, requires more attention in debates and informed policy regarding access to firearms and suicide prevention in Switzerland.

AB Switzerland has low deceased organ donation rates. It is also one of the few countries where assisted suicide is decriminalized in some circumstances. If organs donated by Swiss and foreign citizens assisted in committing suicide in Switzerland were used for transplantation, the country could achieve a surplus of organs. There are several practical problems and ethical and legal objections to this proposal, all of which can be overcome. Organ donation after planned death is a potential solution to the organ scarcity problem in any country that permits assisted dying.

TI Diversity and change in suicide seasonality over 125 years
SO JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
LA English
DT Article

AB Background: Recent research has corroborated the notion that seasonality in suicide is more heterogeneous and less consistent than postulated by former scholars. This work investigates the smoothing out of suicide seasonality in Switzerland between the late 19th and the end of the 20th century. It includes analyses by region and by suicide method.
   Methods: Monthly suicide frequencies in Switzerland are available for the period 1876 - 2000. Data on canton/region are available for the periods 1901 - 1920 and 1969 - 2000, and data on suicide method for the periods 1881 - 1920 and 1969 - 2000. Analyses focusing on the overall change rely on data aggregated by quinquennia. The Edwards' test and the peak-low ratio were used in univariate analyses of seasonality. Putative determinants of the peak-low ratio were examined using regression analysis with cantonal data.
   Results: The decrease of seasonal effects in suicide applies to a period of more than 100 years in Switzerland. Big differences of seasonal effects have existed all the time with regard to specific methods and to specific regions. No seasonality was apparent in poisoning, and in Geneva and Basle City, respectively. However, the seasonal effects have been most impressive in drowning and hanging suicides, and in rural Catholic regions. In regression analysis, the decline in suicide seasonality is associated with the decline in the agricultural work force.
   Conclusions: The smoothing out of suicide seasonality in Switzerland has been a continuous long term process, which probably started by the end of 19th century. Seasonal effects in suicide will probably fade away in most regions of Switzerland and in most suicide methods. This process is in parallel with the disappearance of the traditional rural society.

   Background In the 19th century, eminent French sociologist Emile Durkheim found suicide rates to be higher in the Protestant compared with the Catholic cantons of Switzerland. We examined religious affiliation and suicide in modern Switzerland, where assisted suicide is legal.
   Methods The 2000 census records of 1 722 456 (46.0%) Catholics, 1 565 452 (41.8%) Protestants and 454 397 (12.2%) individuals with no affiliation were linked to mortality records up to December 2005. The association between religious affiliation and suicide, with the Protestant faith serving as the reference category, was examined in Cox regression models. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were adjusted for age, marital status, education, type of household, language and degree of urbanization.
   Results Suicide rates per 100 000 inhabitants were 19.7 in Catholics (1664 suicides), 28.5 in Protestants (2158 suicides) and 39.0 in those with no affiliation (882 suicides). Associations with religion were modified by age and gender (P < 0.0001). Compared with Protestant men aged 35-64 years, HRs (95% CI) for all suicides were 0.80 (0.73-0.88) in Catholic men and 1.09 (0.98-1.22) in men with no affiliation; and 0.60 (0.53-0.67) and 1.96 (1.69-2.27), respectively, in men aged 65-94 years. Corresponding HRs in women aged 35-64 years were 0.90 (0.80-1.03) and 1.46 (1.25-1.72); and 0.67 (0.59-0.77) and 2.63 (2.22-3.12) in women aged 65-94 years. The association was strongest for suicides by poisoning in the 65-94-year-old age group, the majority of which was assisted: HRs were 0.45 (0.35-0.59) for Catholic men and 3.01 (2.37-3.82) for men with no affiliation; 0.44 (0.36-0.55) for Catholic women and 3.14 (2.51-3.94) for women with no affiliation.
   Conclusions In Switzerland, the protective effect of a religious affiliation appears to be stronger in Catholics than in Protestants, stronger in older than in younger people, stronger in women than in men, and particularly strong for assisted suicides.

ID MOTOR-VEHICLE ACCIDENT; DRIVER SUICIDES
AB Objective: To determine details of road traffic suicides in Switzerland between 2000 and 2010 and to look at our results in relation to studies from other countries.Methods: Retrospective data analysis of road traffic suicides extracted from the database of all suicides investigated by Swiss institutes of forensic medicine between 2000 and 2010 using a standardized assessment sheet.Results: Out of 4,885 suicides in Switzerland, we identified 76 cases (1.56%) of road traffic suicide. Twenty-three cases had to be excluded because, although the forensic medical experts suspected suicide, they could not establish it for sure. That left 53 cases (1.02% of all suicides), mostly unmarried men, who were on average 9years younger than the study population as a whole. Most collided with other vehicles, mainly other cars, and usually on main highways or country roads. In most cases, the cause of death was multiple injuries. Other persons were killed 4times more often than with other suicide methods. Toxicology screening was performed significantly more frequently than with other methods but more often proved negative. Acute psychiatric problems were commonly assumed to be the underlying reasons. Suicide notes were left by only 20%, a lower proportion than in the study population as a whole.Conclusions: Road traffic suicides account for approximately 1% of all suicide methods used in Switzerland, although unclassifiable cases indicate that the rate might be higher. Every road traffic crash should therefore be routinely investigated by an interdisciplinary team and suicide should be considered as the possible cause.

TI Euthanasia and assisted suicide: Comparison of legal aspects in
   Switzerland and other countries
SO MEDICINE SCIENCE AND THE LAW
LA English
DT Article
AB The purpose of this paper is to present the legal aspects associated with assisted suicide in Switzerland and compare them with those in other countries. Like euthanasia, assisted suicide is a subject that induces much discussion in many countries. While the law is very liberal in some countries, such as Belgium and the Netherlands (where both euthanasia and assisted suicide take place), these practices are very controversial in other countries, such as France, where they remain taboo subjects.
   In the United States of America, the laws concerning assisted suicide can differ greatly from one state to another. For example, in Oregon, assisted suicide is allowed if applied by a medical doctor; in others, this act is illegal. In Canada, it is punishable according to the Criminal Code.
   In Switzerland euthanasia is punishable by law. However, the penal code does not condemn assisted suicide, whether carried out by a medical doctor or another person, provided it is not carried out through selfish motives. The application of these practices has become simplified in recent years and societies for the right to die with dignity based on this principle have come into being (Exit and Dignitas).
   In the French- and German-speaking parts of Switzerland the association Exit assists individuals living in Switzerland with serious progressive and incurable disease in their engagement to end their life. The association Dignitas, in the German-speaking part of Switzerland, also undertakes - in the same circumstances - to assist individuals coming from foreign countries. Dignitas welcomes several such individuals every year, especially from Germany, where a similar approach does not currently exist.

AB Objectives: Chronic and acute alcohol use are highly associated risk factors for suicides worldwide. Therefore, we examined suicide cases with and without alcohol use disorder (AUD) using data from the SNSF project "Suicide in Switzerland: A detailed national survey". Our investigations focus on correlations between acute and chronic alcohol use with reference to suicide and potential interactions with the methods of suicide.
   Methods: We used data from the SNSF project in which all cases of registered completed suicide in Switzerland reported to any of the seven Swiss institutes of legal and forensic medicine between 2000 and 2010 were collected. We extracted cases that were tested for blood alcohol to use in our analysis. We compared clinical characteristics, blood alcohol concentrations, and methods of suicide in cases with and without AUD.
   Results: Out of 6497 cases, 2946 subjects were tested for acute alcohol use and included in our analysis. Of the latter, 366 (12.4%) persons had a medical history of AUD. Subjects with AUD significantly had higher blood alcohol concentrations and were more often in medical treatment before suicide. Drug intoxication as method of suicide was more frequent in cases with AUD compared to NAUD.
   Conclusion: Overall, we found a high incidence of acute alcohol use at the time of death in chronic alcohol misusers (AUD). The five methods of suicide most commonly used in Switzerland differed considerably between individuals with and without AUD. Blood alcohol concentrations varied across different methods of suicide independently from the medical history in both groups.

TI Exploring the experiences of bereaved families involved in assisted
   suicide in Southern Switzerland: a qualitative study
SO BMJ SUPPORTIVE & PALLIATIVE CARE
LA English
DT Article
ID EUTHANASIA
AB Background In Switzerland, helping with assisted suicide under certain conditions is not prosecuted. With approximately 300 cases annually, this leaves behind a large group of bereaved people where its consequences are mostly unknown. The study aimed to explore family involvement in decision making prior to assisted suicide, and to examine their ways of coping during the bereavement period.
   Methods A qualitative interview study used the principles of Grounded Theory analysis. Eleven relatives of eight patients, who died in Southern Switzerland after assisted suicide, participated in semistructured interviews.
   Results The large majority of family members faced moral dilemmas during the decision-making phase. Their respect for patient's autonomy was a key justification to resolve dilemmas. Two types of involvement were identified: categorised as 'passive' when the decision making was located with the patient, and 'active' when assisted suicide was proposed by the family member and/or the relative was involved in some way. The relatives reported feelings of isolation during and after assisted suicide. Family members reported fear of social stigma and did not openly disclose assisted suicide as the cause of death. None of those interviewed received formal psychological support.
   Conclusions Bereaved families express moral dilemmas, feelings of isolation and secrecy in the management of assisted suicide in Southern Switzerland. These features seem underestimated and not sufficiently recognised by the healthcare professionals. Management of assisted suicide requests should include consideration of family members' needs, in addition to those of the patient.

AB Context. Thousands of family members worldwide are annually involved in assisted dying. Family participation in assisted dying has rarely been investigated and families' needs typically are not considered in assisted dying legislation and clinical guidelines.
   Objectives. To explore family caregivers' reflections on experiences of assisted suicide in Switzerland.
   Methods. A cross-sectional qualitative interview study conducted in the Italian-and French-speaking regions of Switzerland. Interpretation and analysis were performed using qualitative content analysis.
   Results. Twenty-eight close relatives and family carers of 18 patients who died by assisted suicide in Switzerland were interviewed. Family members perceived their involvement in assisted suicide as characterized by five phases; 1) contemplation, 2) gaining acceptance, 3) gaining permission, 4) organization, and 5) aftermath. Families can participate in these phases at diverse levels and with varying degrees of involvement. Important triggers for families and patients for transition between phases include patients' experiences of their life-threatening illnesses and related treatments, their increasing awareness of approaching death, and family member recognition of their loved one's unbearable suffering. Participating in assisted suicide created further demanding tasks for families in addition to their role of caregivers.
   Conclusion. Families appeared to be involved in the preparation of assisted suicide along with patients, irrespective of their personal values regarding assisted dying. Support for family members is essential if they are involved in tasks preparatory to assisted suicide. Clinical guidelines and policies concerning assisted dying should acknowledge and address family needs. (C) 2017 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective To analyze characteristics of suicide methods of psychiatric inpatients that were carried out within and outside of psychiatric hospitals in order to identify adequate suicide prevention measures.
   Methods Data of 436 inpatient suicides were included in the data base of all institutes of forensic medicine in Switzerland for the years 2000 -2010.We compared details of suicide methods that were applied within and outside psychiatric hospitals.
   Results About two thirds of all suicides were carried out outside psychiatric hospitals. Inpatients most often used jumping in front of a train, jumps from heights and drowning outside of the hospital. Within psychiatric care units patients most often died by hanging, jumps from height and self-poisoning. Heights of fall were significantly lower in suicides carried out within the hospital (Median 9 versus 22 m). In psychiatric hospitals incomplete hanging was found in 75.6%. Waist belts were the tools most often employed.
   Conclusions Windows and other spots in inpatient units should be secured if higher than first storey respectively 4 meters. Suspension points have to be secured at a low level especially in non-public rooms.

AB Guidelines provided by the Director of Public Prosecutions suggest that anyone assisting another to commit suicide in England and Wales, or elsewhere, will not be prosecuted provided there are no self-seeking motives and no active encouragement. This reflects the position in Switzerland. There, however, no difference is made between assistance and inducement. In addition, the Swiss approach makes it possible to establish organisations to assist the suicides of both their citizens and foreign visitors. It should not be assumed that this approach is without controversy in Switzerland. Proposals for reform continue to be debated there, not least because of the concern about some of the actual practices of certain end-of-life organisations. It is likely that a few English citizens will continue to avail themselves of these services in Switzerland if they cannot find the help they require here. This paper explores the legitimacy of the current restrictive position adopted towards assisted suicide in England. It argues that the provisions within the guidelines prohibiting organisations that assist suicides, leaves some without the help they need. While legislative decriminalisation of assisted suicide and the establishment of state-sponsored suicide centres would represent the most permissive regime, this paper proposes that this would be a step too far. The preference here is for decriminalisation but adopting a 'middle way' between the two extremes: the more permissive approach provided by the 'Swiss model' is one that could be employed here, albeit within a more robust regulatory regime.

AB OBJECTIVE: The number of suicides assisted by right-to-die associations has increased in recent years in Switzerland. The aim of our study was to compare time trends in rates of assisted and unassisted suicide from 1991-2008.
   METHODS: The Swiss National Cohort is a longitudinal study of mortality in the Swiss population; based on linkage of census data with mortality records up to 2008. The Federal Statistical Office coded suspected assisted suicides from 1998 onwards; and from 2003 onwards right-to-die associations reported the suicides they assisted. We used Poisson regression to analyse trends in rates of suicide per 100'000 person-years, by gender and age groups (15-34, 35-64, 65-94 years).
   RESULTS: A total of 7'940'297 individuals and 24'842 suicides were included. In women, rates changed little in the younger age groups but increased in 65-94-year-olds, due to an increase in suicide by poisoning (from 5.1 to 17.2 per 100'000; p < 0.001). An increase in suicides by poisoning was also observed in older men (from 8.6 to 18.2; p<0.001). Most suicides by poisoning were assisted. In men, suicide rates declined in all age groups, driven by declines in suicide with firearms.
   CONCLUSIONS: Research is needed to gain a better understanding of the reasons for the tripling of assisted suicide rates in older women, and the doubling of rates in older men, of attitudes and vulnerabilities of those choosing assisted suicide, and of access to palliative care. Rates of assisted suicide should be monitored; including data on patient characteristics and underlying comorbidities.

DE Assisted suicide; Euthanasia; W.N. Hohfeld; Switzerland
AB Several countries have adopted legislation that authorises some form of euthanasia or assisted suicide. The provision of assisted suicide for altruistic motives has been legal in Switzerland for a long time. The historical roots of this liberal stance are interesting because they partly hark back to earlier times, before the modern debates centred on personal autonomy as regards death. An accurate analysis of the Swiss normative situation is not easy since informal norms play a major role alongside positive statutes. We analyse this normative situation by making use of the concepts of privileges and claims as developed by W.N. Hohfeld and L. Wenar. We emphasize the importance of a philosophical reflection that goes beyond the bioethical controversy, with a view to clarifying the basic liberties involved in enabling assisted death.

ID STRATEGIES; VALIDITY; SCALES
AB Suicide is a major public health concern, which disproportionally affects young people. Therefore, effective prevention strategies are needed, but there is a dearth of controlled trials on this topic. Our study will evaluate the effectiveness of a suicide prevention program in Switzerland, where data are scarce. It will test whether the prevention program (1) increases knowledge of suicide and awareness of suicidal risks, (2) provides resources to seek/offer help, (3) increases communication skills related to suicide, (4) increases coping skills, (5) is acceptable, and (6) reduces suicidal ideation and psychological distress. The project will be a single-center cluster non-randomized controlled trial designed to compare an intervention group benefitting from the suicide prevention program with a control group. The potential benefits include a better understanding and evaluation of suicide prevention programs, which may lead to improved primary and secondary prevention practices.

AB Objective: Firearms are the most common method of suicide among young men in Switzerland. From March 2003 through February 2004, the number of Swiss soldiers was halved as a result of an army reform (Army XXI), leading to a decrease in the availability of guns nationwide. The authors investigated the patterns of the overall suicide rate and the firearm suicide rate before and after the reform.
   Method: Using a naturalistic study design, the authors compared suicide rates before (1995-2003) and after the intervention (2004-2008) in the affected population (men ages 18-43) and in two comparison groups (women ages 18-44 and men ages 44-53). Data were received from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office. Interrupted time series analysis was used to control for preexisting temporal trends. Alternative methods (Poisson regression, autocorrelation analysis, and surrogate data tests) were used to check validity.
   Results: The authors found a reduction in both the overall suicide rate and the firearm suicide rate after the Army XXI reform. No significant increases were found for other suicide methods overall. An increase in railway suicides was observed. It was estimated that 22% of the reduction in firearm suicides was substituted by other suicide methods. The attenuation of the suicide rate was not compensated for during the follow-up years. Neither of the comparison groups showed statistically significant changes in firearm suicide rate and overall suicide rate.
   Conclusions: The restriction of firearm availability in Switzerland resulting from the Army XXI reform was followed by an enduring decrease in the general suicide rate.

AB This qualitative study investigated the personal and professional stances of 40 health and social care professionals confronted with assisted suicide of older persons living in nursing homes or supported by social welfare or home care and support services in French-speaking Switzerland. Requests of assisted suicide triggered questions with regard to the professional mission, the quality of accompaniment, values, and ethical principles. Four types of stances emerged from the analysis performed according to the principles of the grounded theory: favorable in principle, professional compromise, personal compromise, and opposed in principle. Each stance results from the combination of several dimensions: personal or professional concordance or compatibility with assisted suicide; implication in, and impact of, the process; appreciation of the process; and satisfaction with the resources at disposal. The differentiated stances adopted by professionals depend largely on their way of interpreting their mission, deontology, and the relationship to the older person.

AB Background
   In Switzerland assisted suicide is legal if no self-interest is involved.
   Aims
   To compare the strength and direction of associations with sociodemographic factors between assisted and unassisted suicides.
   Method
   We calculated rates and used Cox and logistic regression models in a longitudinal study of the Swiss population.
   Results
   Analyses were based on 5004 403 people, 1301 assisted and 5708 unassisted suicides from 2003 to 2008. The rate of unassisted suicides was higher in men than in women, rates of assisted suicides were similar in men and women. Higher education was positively associated with assisted suicide, but negatively with unassisted. Living alone, having no children and no religious affiliation were associated with higher rates of both.
   Conclusions
   Some situations that indicate greater vulnerability such as living alone were associated with both assisted and unassisted suicide. Among the terminally ill, women were more likely to choose assisted suicide, whereas men died more often by unassisted suicide.

The deceased travelled to Switzerland because that country permits self-determination of death, unconditional on it being consequential to palliative treatment for a terminal illness. Australia, like the United Kingdom and most developed nations, does not permit euthanasia and assisted suicide is criminal. This article examines the discretionary issues around criminal culpability for the journey of the deceased from Australia to Switzerland for the known purpose of suicide. We argue the allocation of prosecutorial discretion in cases of assisted suicide is contrary to public interest. We consider the decisional framework that informed the centenarian's decision. We explain why a decisional paradigm, rather than medical, moral or other structures, should inform law and policy regarding assisted dying and give developed nations, such as Australia, cause for reform.

AB News items reporting self-immolation by Tibetans have been on the increase in recent years. After examining the corpse of a Swiss man who had committed suicide by deliberate self-burning, we wondered how often this occurs in Switzerland. The Federal Statistics Office (FSO) does not register self-burning specifically so no official national data on this form of suicide are available. However, we had access to the data from a Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) project Suicides in Switzerland between 2000 and 2010, which collected information on all (4885) cases of suicide investigated by the various institutes of forensic medicine. From this data pool we extracted 50 cases (1.02%) of suicide by self-burning, in order to determine the details and to identify the possible reasons for choosing this method. To look at our results in the light of studies from other countries, we searched the literature for studies that had also retrospectively examined suicide by self-immolation based on forensic records. Our results showed that, on the whole, personal aspects of self-burning in Switzerland do not differ from those in other industrialised nations. Some data, including religious and sociocultural background, were unfortunately missing - not only from our study but also from the similar ones. In our opinion, the most important prevention strategy is to make healthcare professionals more aware of this rare method of suicide. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

AB Objective To determine whether the strong increase in assisted suicides in Switzerland since 2008 is linked to a shift in the socioeconomic factors associated with assisted suicide and its related diagnoses.
   Methods In a population-based longitudinal study, we investigated assisted suicides in Switzerland over the period 2003-2014. Two groups of younger (25-64 years) and older (65-94 years) persons were analysed separately and compared. We calculated crude rates and used Cox proportional hazard and logistic regression models to examine associations of assisted dying with gender, marital status, education, religion, neighbourhood socioeconomic status and other variables, and investigated trends over time.
   Results We identified 3941 assisted suicides among 6 237 997 Swiss residents, 80% of which occurred in the older age group. Crude rates of assisted suicide more than tripled during the study period from 3.60 to 11.21 per 100 000 person-years; the increase was more pronounced in the older age group. Cancer was the most common underlying diagnosis (41.8%), but the percentage dying assisted was highest among patients with diseases of the nervous system (5.25% in the younger and 1.23% in the older age group). The factors associated with assisted suicide did not change during the study period. Female gender, higher education, having no religious affiliation, no children and a Swiss passport, living in a neighbourhood with a higher socioeconomic index and living in the French-speaking part of Switzerland were associated with a higher rate.
   Conclusions The study results do not indicate any shift in socioeconomic factors associated with assisted suicide, but a more pronounced increase in incidence among the elderly.

AB The objective of this study is to identify patterns (components and processes) of reconstruction of suicide survivors. In-depth interviews were conducted with 50 survivors of suicide in Switzerland. Data were analyzed using ATLAS. ti and according to the Grounded Theory principles. Survivors of suicide face four major challenges: dealing with the impact of suicide, searching for meaning, clarifying responsibility, and finding a personal style of reaction and coping. The various ways in which survivors fare through the specific processes of the challenges result in various patterns of reconstruction: the vulnerability, transformation, commitment, and hard blow. The unique characteristics and dynamics of each of them are highlighted. Health care providers would benefit from an approach based on the dynamics of the various patterns of reconstruction in providing appropriate support to survivors of suicide.

AB In light of the ongoing debate over tighter firearm regulations, this paper considers the relationship between gun prevalence and suicide. I exploit a reform in Switzerland that reduced the prevalence of military-issued guns in private households. In Switzerland, military service is compulsory for men, and military-issued guns account for nearly half of the total number of firearms available. The results show that the firearm suicide rate decreases by 9% for a reduction in gun prevalence of 1000 guns per 100,000 inhabitants. The elasticity of gun suicides with respect to firearm prevalence is +0.48, but converges towards zero for low levels of gun prevalence. The overall suicide rate is negatively and significantly related to firearm prevalence, which indicates that non-gun methods of suicide are not perfect replacements for firearms.

AB The highly charged debate about the moral status of assisted suicide features regularly in the news media in medically advanced countries. In the United Kingdom, the debate has been dominated in recent years by a new mode of death: assisted suicide in Switzerland, so-called suicide tourism. Drawing on in-depth interviews with people who were actively planning on going to Switzerland,' alongside participant-observation at a do-it-yourself self-deliverance workshop, I discuss how participants arrived at their decision to seek professionalized assistance. In doing so, I explore the constituent elements of people's suffering, examining how participants justified, rationalized, or sought authentication from a doctor for their decision to die in light of their own belief systems and aesthetic preferences for a good death.

TI Swiss physicians' attitudes to assisted suicide
SO SWISS MEDICAL WEEKLY
LA English
DT Article
DE physician-assisted suicide; assisted suicide; suicide regulation
AB PRINCIPLES: In Switzerland, assisted suicide is legal as long as it does not involve self-serving motives. Physician-assisted suicide is regulated by specific guidelines issued by the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences (SAMS). This article summarises the results of an empirical study of physicians' attitudes to assisted suicide in Switzerland, which was commissioned by the SAMS. The study (in German) is available online at: www.samw.ch.
   METHODS: Twelve qualitative interviews and a written survey were conducted, involving a disproportional, stratified random sample of Swiss physicians (4,837 contacted, 1,318 respondents, response rate 27%).
   RESULTS: Due to the response rate and the wide variation of respondents from one professional speciality to another, the findings and interpretations presented should be regarded as applying only to the group of physicians who are interested in or are particularly affected by the issue of assisted suicide. They cannot be generalised to the whole body of physicians in Switzerland. Of the respondents, 77% considered physician-assisted suicide to be justifiable in principle, while 22% were fundamentally opposed to it. Although 43% could imagine situations where they would personally be prepared to perform assisted suicide, it is clear from the study that this potential readiness does not mean that all respondents would automatically be prepared to perform it in practice as soon as the legal criteria are met. The vast majority of respondents emphasised that there should be no obligation to perform physician-assisted suicide. Opinions differed as to whether physician-assisted suicide should remain restricted to cases where the person concerned is approaching the end of life. While a large majority of respondents considered physician-assisted suicide also to be justifiable in principle in non-end-of-life situations, 74% supported the maintenance of the end-of-life criterion in the SAMS Guidelines as a necessary condition for physician- assisted suicide. Over 50% of the respondents had never been confronted with a request for assisted suicide by a patient.
   CONCLUSIONS: The vast majority of physicians surveyed considered assisted suicide to be justifiable in principle; however, their support was strongly dependent on the specific situation. The study indicates that even physicians expressing a potential readiness to perform assisted suicide themselves would not do so automatically if all the criteria for assisted suicide were met. Assisted suicide thus appears to be an exceptional situation, which physicians would only become involved in on a voluntary basis. The authors recommend that the current SAMS Guidelines regulating physician-assisted suicide in Switzerland should be reviewed with regard to the end-of-life criterion as a necessary condition for physician-assisted suicide.

TI Suicide tourism: a pilot study on the Swiss phenomenon
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
AB While assisted suicide (AS) is strictly restricted in many countries, it is not clearly regulated by law in Switzerland. This imbalance leads to an influx of people -'suicide tourists'-coming to Switzerland, mainly to the Canton of Zurich, for the sole purpose of committing suicide. Political debate regarding 'suicide tourism' is taking place in many countries. Swiss medicolegal experts are confronted with these cases almost daily, which prompted our scientific investigation of the phenomenon. The present study has three aims: (1) to determine selected details about AS in the study group (age, gender and country of residence of the suicide tourists, the organisation involved, the ingested substance leading to death and any diseases that were the main reason for AS); (2) to find out the countries from which suicide tourists come and to review existing laws in the top three in order to test the hypothesis that suicide tourism leads to the amendment of existing regulations in foreign countries; and (3) to compare our results with those of earlier studies in Zurich. We did a retrospective data analysis of the Zurich Institute of Legal Medicine database on AS of non-Swiss residents in the last 5 years (2008-2012), and internet research for current legislation and political debate in the three foreign countries most concerned. We analysed 611 cases from 31 countries all over the world. Non-terminal conditions such as neurological and rheumatic diseases are increasing among suicide tourists. The unique phenomenon of suicide tourism in Switzerland may indeed result in the amendment or supplementary guidelines to existing regulations in foreign countries.

The 133 cases reviewed were classified according to the manner of death, that is, suicide (106 cases), homicide (25 cases), and accident (2 cases). Various data from police authorities and the medicolegal examinations of the bodies were studied, including the age and sex of the victims, location of the event, type of firearm used, concomitant use or nonuse of alcohol and/or other drugs, seasonality, and entry site. These various elements were compared with data found in the literature.

AB 'Undetermined' (UnD) and accidental deaths (AccD) are explored as possible sources of 'under-reported-suicides' (URS) in 20 Western countries.
   WHO mortality rates per million of AccD, UnD and suicides analysed. UnD:suicides ratios of < 1:5 calculated as likely URS versus ratios > 1:10 unlikely URS and all correlated by sex and age.
   Male URS likely in 7 countries and in 11 for females. URS in AccD likely in 5 countries for both sexes only UnD and suicide rates the elderly (75+) significantly correlated.
   Strong indication of URS in the UK, Portugal, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark and Germany with likely URS in AccD in Greece, Portugal, Switzerland and USA. These findings have important implications, indicating that, with the exception of France and Japan, official reported suicide rates contain a degree of under-reporting, and especially for women yet it is essential to have accurate suicide data to ensure adequate service provision.

AB Methods: We linked the suicides assisted by right-to-die associations during 2003-08 to a census-based longitudinal study of the Swiss population. We used Cox and logistic regression models to examine associations with gender, age, marital status, education, religion, type of household, urbanization, neighbourhood socio-economic position and other variables. Separate analyses were done for younger (25 to 64 years) and older (65 to 94 years) people.
   Results: Analyses were based on 5 004 403 Swiss residents and 1301 assisted suicides (439 in the younger and 862 in the older group). In 1093 (84.0%) assisted suicides, an underlying cause was recorded; cancer was the most common cause (508, 46.5%). In both age groups, assisted suicide was more likely in women than in men, those living alone compared with those living with others and in those with no religious affiliation compared with Protestants or Catholics. The rate was also higher in more educated people, in urban compared with rural areas and in neighbourhoods of higher socio-economic position. In older people, assisted suicide was more likely in the divorced compared with the married; in younger people, having children was associated with a lower rate.
   Conclusions: Assisted suicide in Switzerland was associated with female gender and situations that may indicate greater vulnerability such as living alone or being divorced, but also with higher education and higher socio-economic position.

AB Non-physician volunteers of Exit, the largest right-to-die organization in Switzerland, play an important role in assisted suicide. They conduct assessments and deliver lethal medications for a member to self-administer. This study analyses the content of 114 intake sheets (checklists) of Exit members whose requests for assisted suicide were granted in an effort to examine the frequency of depression and whether their relatives agreed with the member's decision to commit suicide (2 questions that can help increase the likelihood that the member's decision was both informed and voluntary). Exit's paperwork indicated that depression was found to exist in 27% of the cases, was more common among those under 65, and relatives explicitly disagreed with the member's decision in 5% of the cases.

AB AIMS: In comparison with other central European countries, Switzerland has a high prevalence of gun ownership and a high rate of suicide by shooting. After the Army XXI reform in 2003, which reduced personnel from about 400,000 to approximately 200,000, a decline in suicides by firearms and a decline in the total number of suicides was observed in national data spanning the period from 2000 to 2010. It is, however, unclear whether this decline can be linked to the reduced availability of military guns. This study explored whether the decline in suicide by firearms is related to the decline of suicides by army weapons. METHODS: In 83.1% ( n = 1112) of the 1338 suicides by firearm between 2000 and 2010 in Switzerland, the firearm could be categorised as an army weapon or a non- army weapon. The army weapon was used in 39.1% of these suicides. In comparison with other firearms, those who used army weapons tended to be younger and more likely to have a university degree. A prior suicide attempt was found less often in cases using a military weapon than other firearms. After the Army XXI reform, there was a significant drop in suicides by males aged 18 to 43 years using an army weapon, but no change in male suicide rates in the same age group who used a non- army weapon. The drop was statistically linked to a reduction of suicide by the army gun. RESULTS: The army weapon was used in 39.1% of suicides by firearm between 2000 and 2010 in Switzerland. In comparison with other methods, those who used army weapons tended to be younger and more likely to have a university degree. A prior suicide attempt was found less often in cases using a military weapon than other methods. After the Army XXI reform, there was a significant drop in suicides by males aged 18 to 43 years using an army weapon, but no change in males' suicide rates in the same age group who used a non- army weapon. The drop was statistically linked to a reduction of suicide by the army gun. CONCLUSIONS: Males who use army weapons differ from those who use other types of weapons. The significant drop in suicides was found in males aged 18 to 43 but there was no change in males of the same age group who used a non- army weapon. These results support the hypotheses that the observed drop in suicides is linked to the Army XXI reform and that restriction of access to guns is essential for reducing suicides by firearm.

AB This paper presents three different models of the legal regulation of assisted suicide in European countries. First, the current legal regime governing assisted suicide in the Netherlands is described where both euthanasia and assisted suicide have been legalised. This section also includes some empirical data on euthanasia and assisted-suicide practices in the Netherlands, as well as a comparison with the current legal legislation in Belgium and Luxembourg. Next, Switzerland is presented as a country where euthanasia is punishable by law but assisted suicide is legally allowed, provided it is not carried out with selfish motives. This section also focuses on the assisted-suicide related case law of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court and the European Court of Human Rights. Last, the current legal situation regarding assisted suicide in Austria and Germany is described. While the Austrian Penal Code explicitly prohibits assisted suicide, assistance with suicide is not specifically regulated by the German Penal Code. However, medical doctors are not allowed to assist suicides according to the professional codes of conduct drawn up by the German medical associations under the supervision of the health authorities.

AB The Netherlands, Oregon and Switzerland are the only areas in the world where assistance in dying has legally been practised in recent years. This article provides a detailed comparison of the history of the origins, legislation, monitoring systems and the extent of assistance in dying in these three places. It shows that the actual practice in Switzerland which, unlike Oregon, also allows assistance in suicide by means of infusions or gastric tubes, can today be technically quite similar to the permitted practice of active euthanasia on request in the Netherlands. Considering the preconditions restricting these practices, Swiss regulations are the most open, in that the law requires neither a medical second opinion (as in both the Netherlands and Oregon) nor the existence of a terminal illness (as in Oregon) as prerequisite to assistance in dying. In 2001, the proportion of assisted deaths (as reported to the authorities) in all deaths was almost ten times higher in the Netherlands (1.5% of all deaths) then in Oregon (<0.1% of all deaths) or Switzerland (0.2% of all deaths).
   The analysis of the different normative concepts underlying legislation reveals that in the Netherlands the basis for non-prosecution lies in the conflict of the physician's duties to respect life versus relief of suffering, while in the USA and in Switzerland the right-to-die concept plays a major role. These two concepts allow appreciation of distinctions between the roles of the physician in end-of-life practices and between assisted suicide and voluntary active euthanasia.

AB QUESTIONS: The Swiss Health Observatory recently reported that the Canton of Zurich ranked fourth highest among the Swiss cantons in regard to suicide rates. The aim of this study was to identify sociodemographic risk factors (such as sex, age, marital status, religion and place of residence) in relation to suicide rates in the Canton of Zurich, and to explore suicide methods and co-morbidities from all suicides in this area between 1995 and 2007.
   METHOD: Data from Swiss statistics on causes of death were analysed using statistical modelling.
   RESULTS: Suicides were found to be more frequent among men than women, and suicide was more prevalent in older or single people than in younger or married people, respectively. Age groups over 70 had increasingly high suicide rates compared to lower age groups. Investigating geographical distribution, highest suicide risks were found in the cities and high-income municipalities. The chosen suicide methods differed among age and sex groups. Poisoning was more than twice as frequent among women, and more common with increasing age in both sexes. Usage of firearms was about ten times as frequent among men. For train suicides, the age group of 10 to 19 years predominated. In 36% of suicide cases, mental disorders were listed as co-morbidities; in 12% malignant tumours were reported.
   CONCLUSIONS: Relatively low rates of mental illness were reported in older suicide victims, despite a massively rising suicide rate with increase of age, indicating that undiagnosed depression could contribute to the high suicide rates in the elderly. Demographic changes in the coming years may result in larger numbers of suicides.

AB At the end of the 19(th) century, male suicide rates in Switzerland were as high as the respective rates in recent decades, whereas female suicide rates were distinctly lower. An age-period-cohort analysis was performed to provide more information about the gender-specific changes over the last century. Suicide mortality has been reported in Switzerland since 1876 when the standardised registration of mortality data began. The analysed data cover the period 1881-2000. The statistical analyses were based on log-linear models and data aggregated by 10-year age-intervals and 10-year period-intervals. The results indicate similar age and period effects in males and females. The estimates representing age-specific risk increase steadily with age, with intermediate plateaus in the 20s and the 50s. The period-specific estimates follow the economic cycles. The birth cohort effects are stronger in males and weaker in females. In the males' estimates, there is a peak in cohorts born around 1840 and a low in cohorts born some 60-100 years later. The estimates increased again in generations born after World War II. In females, the birth cohort estimates are low in cohorts born in the first half of the 19(th) century and increase until the first half of the 20(th) century. Birth cohort effects remain an intriguing topic in epidemiology of suicide. A better understanding of birth cohort effects might open new doors to suicide prevention.

AB Context: Families are known to be involved in assisted dying and their involvement can be influenced by many factors. Objectives: To explore how Swiss families interact with health care professionals and right-to-die associations regarding assisted suicide and their choices around disclosure. Methods: A secondary data analysis on a cross-sectional qualitative interview study conducted in the Italian- and French-speaking parts of Switzerland was conducted. Interviews with 28 bereaved family members were analyzed using framework analysis. Results: Two main themes were identified: (1) Interactions with physicians and right-to-die associations. (2) Choices about disclosing their experiences. In general, families believed that assisted suicide is a private matter, to be pursued mainly outside the medical field and involved physicians only when necessary. Families appeared to deliberately limit interaction with physicians and to be more comfortable interacting with the right-to-die associations. Some participants presumed a clear choice between assisted suicide or palliative care. Disclosing to others the decision, and preparation of assisted suicide emerged to be an important emotional burden for families. Some family members preferred to restrict disclosure before and after assisted suicide, by sometimes not informing other family members until the final days. Conclusions: In Switzerland, there is limited interaction between families and health care professionals concerning assisted suicide decisions, whereas families reported more open interactions with right-to-die associations. It is recommended that the needs of families should be reflected in health policies, taking into consideration the different contexts where assisted dying is permitted.

AB Introduction In many countries, mortality due to suicide is higher among people living with HIV than in the general population. We aimed to analyse trends in suicide mortality before and after the introduction of triple combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), and to identify risk factors associated with death from suicide in Switzerland. Methods We analysed data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study from the pre-cART (1988-1995), earlier cART (1996-2008) and later cART (2009-2017) eras. We used multivariable Cox regression to assess risk factors for death due to suicide in the ART era and computed standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) to compare mortality rates due to suicide among persons living with HIV with the general population living in Switzerland, using data from the Swiss National Cohort. Results and Discussion We included 20,136 persons living with HIV, of whom 204 (1.0%) died by suicide. In men, SMRs for suicide declined from 12.9 (95% CI 10.4-16.0) in the pre-cART era to 2.4 (95% CI 1.2-5.1) in the earlier cART and 3.1 (95% CI 2.3-4.3) in the later cART era. In women, the corresponding ratios declined from 14.2 (95% CI 7.9-25.7) to 10.2 (3.8-27.1) and to 3.3 (95% CI 1.5-7.4). Factors associated with death due to suicide included gender (adjusted hazard ratio 0.58 (95% CI 0.38-0.87) comparing women with men), nationality (1.95 (95% CI 1.34-2.83) comparing Swiss with other), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention clinical stage (0.33 (95% CI 0.24-0.46) comparing stage A with C), transmission group (2.64 (95% CI 1.71-4.09) for injection drug use and 2.10 (95% CI 1.36-3.24) for sex between men compared to other), and mental health (2.32 (95% CI 1.71-3.14) for a history of psychiatric treatment vs. no history). There was no association with age. Conclusions Suicide rates have decreased substantially among people living with HIV in the last three decades but have remained about three times higher than in the general population since the introduction of cART. Continued emphasis on suicide prevention among men and women living with HIV is important.

ID CLIFTON SUSPENSION BRIDGE; BARRIERS; ACCESS; SITES; JUMPS; FALLS
AB The goal of the study was to compare the effectiveness of different suicide prevention measures implemented on bridges and other high structures in Switzerland. A national survey identified all jumping hotspots that have been secured in Switzerland; of the 15 that could be included in this study, 11 were secured by vertical barriers and 4 were secured by low-hanging horizontal safety nets. The study made an overall and individual pre-post analysis by using Mantel-Haenszel Tests, regression methods and calculating rate ratios. Barriers and safety nets were both effective, with mean suicide reduction of 68.7% (barriers) and 77.1% (safety nets), respectively. Measures that do not secure the whole hotspot and still allow jumps of 15 meters or more were less effective. Further, the analyses revealed that barriers of at least 2.3 m in height and safety-nets fixed significantly below pedestrian level deterred suicidal jumps. Secured bridgeheads and inbound angle barriers seemed to enhance the effectiveness of the measure. Findings can help to plan and improve the effectiveness of future suicide prevention measures on high structures.

   RISK
AB Suicide rates of male and female physicians are about 3-5 times higher compared with the general public. Detailed studies about medical student suicides in the United States exist but similar current data from German speaking countries are lacking.
   In this study suicide among medical students in Germany, Austria and Switzerland was analyzed using Medline and Google search engines and information from insurance companies, public institutions, statistical agencies and leading scientists in Germany, Austria and Switzerland was requested. The incidence of suicide among medical students at the Medical University of Innsbruck was also examined.
   In publications from German speaking countries some medical student suicides are mentioned but current statistics were not available. Between 2006 and 2011 the Tyrolean State Police in Austria registered 14 suicides by students of all disciplines. At Innsbruck Medical University (approximately 2,800 medical students) it was found that 6 medical students committed suicide between June 2007 and June 2012 (rate 36 per 100,000).
   The suicide risk of medical students at the Medical University of Innsbruck appears to be increased. Because of a lack of comparable data it is not possible to show whether these observations can be extrapolated to other universities. It appears that there was no single special event which triggered suicide by the medical students but a combination of individual risk factors and the environment was involved. However, this problem receives insufficient attention.

AB Background and methods: In Switzerland, non-medical right-to-die organisations offer instruction and personal guidance in committing suicide to members suffering from incurable diseases. Suicide is usually committed with a lethal dose of barbiturates prescribed by a physician.
   This study is a retrospective analysis of all case files of assisted suicide kept during the period 1990-2000 by "Exit Deutsche Schweiz", the largest Swiss right-to-die organisation.
   Results: Between 1990 and 2000 Exit assisted in 748 suicides among Swiss residents (0.1% of total deaths, 4.8% of total suicides). 54.4% of the deceased were women. Mean age at death was 73 years in males and 72 years in females (range 18-101 years). Assisted suicide was over-proportionately represented in the German-speaking (p <0.0001), more urbanised (p <0.0001), predominantly Protestant (p <0.0001) cantons. Over the study period the annual number of Exit deaths more than tripled (p <0.0001).
   Of the 331 who died in Canton Zurich, 47.4% had cancer, 11.8% cardiovascular/respiratory disease, 12.4% neurological disease and 7.3% HIV/AIDS. The remaining 21.1% suffered from other, usually non-fatal conditions; 76% of these were women.
   There were no significant changes in sex, age and distribution of diagnoses during the study period. At first all the lethal substances were taken orally, but by the end of the study period 14% were administered via infusion or PEG catheter.
   All assisted suicides in the City of Zurich were duly notified to the authorities.
   Conclusions:The number of suicides assisted by "Exit Deutsche Schweiz" and the practices followed markedly expanded over this time. There was no apparent relaxation of the indications for assisted suicide. Notification of the authorities appeared to be total.

ID BEHAVIOR; INDIVIDUALS; AGGRESSION; RISK
AB Objective: Suicide attempts are common in patients being treated for alcohol-use disorders (AUDs). However, clinical assessment of suicide risk is difficult. In this Swiss multisite study, we propose a decision tree to facilitate identification of profiles of AUD patients at high risk for suicidal behavior. Method: In this retrospective study, we used a sample of 700 patients (243 female), attending I of 12 treatment programs for AUDs in the German-speaking part of Switzerland. Sixty-nine patients who reported a suicide attempt in the 3 months before the index treatment were compared using risk factors with 63 1 patients without a suicide attempt. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were used to identify patients at risk of having had a suicide attempt in the previous 3 months. Results: Consistent with previous empirical findings in AUD patients, a prior history of attempted suicide and severe symptoms of depression and aggression considerably increased the risk of a suicide attempt and, in combination, raised the likelihood of a prior suicide attempt to 52%. In addition, one third of AUD, patients who had a history of suicide attempts and previous inpatient psychiatric treatment, or who were male and had previous inpatient psychiatric treatment, also reported a suicide attempt. Conclusions: The empirically supported decision tree helps to identify profiles of suicidal AUD patients in Switzerland and supplements clinicians' 'judgments in making triage decisions for suicide management.

ID SUICIDE
AB The 2011 attempted assassination of a US representative renewed the national gun control debate. Gun advocates claim mass-casualty events are mitigated and deterred with three policies: (a) permissive gun laws, (b) widespread gun ownership, (c) and encouragement of armed civilians who can intercept shooters. They cite Switzerland and Israel as exemplars. We evaluate these claims with analysis of International Crime Victimization Survey (ICVS) data and translation of laws and original source material. Swiss and Israeli laws limit firearm ownership and require permit renewal one to four times annually. ICVS analysis finds the United States has more firearms per capita and per household than either country. Switzerland and Israel curtail off-duty soldiers' firearm access to prevent firearm deaths. Suicide among soldiers decreased by 40 per cent after the Israeli army's 2006 reforms. Compared with the United States, Switzerland and Israel have lower gun ownership and stricter gun laws, and their policies discourage personal gun ownership.

AB Background. Assisted suicide is permitted in Switzerland provided that assistance is not motivated by selfish reasons. Suicides arc commonly performed with the assistance of right-to-die organisations and the use of a lethal dose of barbiturates prescribed by a participating physician. We examined the reasons physicians provided for writing the prescription and the reasons patients gave for requesting assistance in dying.
   Methods: We analysed all reported cases of assisted suicide that were facilitated by right-to-die organisations between 2001 and 2004 in the city of Zurich, and for which both the medical report and the optional letter written by the decedent providing information on their reasons for seeking assistance in suicide (N = 165).
   Results: The reasons most often reported by physicians (ph), as well as persons who sought help (p), were: pain (ph: 56% of all assisted suicides, p: 58%), need for long-term care (ph: 37%, p: 39%),neurological symptoms (ph: 35%, p: 32%), immobility (ph: 23%, p: 30%) and dyspnoea (ph: 23%, p: 23%). Control of circumstances over death (ph: 12%, p: 39%); loss of dignity (ph: 6%, p: 38%); weakness (ph: 13%, p: 26%); less able to engage in activities that make life enjoyable (ph: 6%, p: 18%); and insomnia and loss of concentration (ph: 4%, p: 13%) were significantly more often mentioned by decedents than by physicians.
   Conclusions: Both prescribing physicians and patients provided with assistance to die quite often mentioned pain and other concerns, many of which were objectively assessable and related to unbearable suffering or unreasonable disability. Concerns referable to autonomy and individual judgement were more often noted by people seeking help than by the prescribing physicians.

AB `Background: In Switzerland, if certain conditions are met, assisted suicide is not prosecuted. International debate suggests that requests for hasten death are often altered by the provision of palliative care. Aims of the study were to explore patients' reasons for choice of assisted suicide and family perceptions of the interactions with health care professionals.
   Patients and methods: This is a qualitative study upon 11 relatives of 8 patients cared for by a palliative care team, deceased of assisted suicide.
   Results: Pain and symptom burden were not regarded by patients as key reasons to seek assisted suicide: existential distress and fear of loss of control were the determinants. Most patients had made pre-illness decisions to use assisted suicide. A general need for perceived control and fear of dependency were reported as a common characteristic of these patients. Patients held misunderstandings about the nature and purpose of palliative care, and the interviewed indicated that patients did not regard provision of palliative care services as influential in preventing their decision.
   Conclusions: Assisted suicide was preferred despite provision of palliative care. Better understanding of the importance placed on perceived control and anticipated dependency is needed. Further research is needed to develop appropriate support for patients contemplating assisted suicide.

AB Objective Switzerland is among the few countries worldwide where a request for assisted suicide (AS) can be granted on the basis of a primary psychiatric diagnosis. Psychiatrists play an increasingly important role in this regard, especially when the request for AS arises in the context of suffering caused by severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI). The objective of the survey was to assess general attitudes among psychiatrists in Switzerland regarding AS requests from patients with SPMI. Method In a cross-sectional survey of 1,311 German-speaking psychiatrists in Switzerland, participants were asked about their attitude to AS for patients with SPMI, based on three case vignettes of patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, treatment-refractory depression, or severe persistent schizophrenia. Result From a final sample of 457 psychiatrists (a response rate of 34.9%) whose mean age was 57.8 years, 48.6% of respondents did not support access to AS for persons diagnosed with SPMI, 21.2% were neutral, and 29.3% indicated some degree of support for access. In relation to the case vignettes, a slightly higher percentage of respondents supported the patient's wish to seek AS: 35.4% for those diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, 32.1% for those diagnosed with depression, and 31.4% for those diagnosed with schizophrenia.

ID DEPRESSION; ALLIANCE
AB In the interdisciplinary treatment process nurses play an important role, assessing suicide risk. To cope with this responsibility, the use of assessment instruments is recommended. Although a lot of instruments exist to assess the risk of suicide, nurses do not use them consistently. This cross-sectional study seeks to answer the following questions: How do nurses assess the suicidality of patients of psychiatric hospitals in the German speaking part of Switzerland? Do they use assessment instruments and if so, which ones? Ward nurses in every psychiatric hospital (n = 32) were asked about the state of the nursing practice in assessing the suicide risk by means of an electronic questionnaire. The following results emerged: Nurses use instruments to assess suicide risk on about half of the wards (n = 119, 50.63 %). 13 % of the mentioned instruments are research-based. Nurses mostly assess suicide endangerment in the case of a presumed danger, less often at admission and least often during the discharge process. As suicidality is assessed mostly when nurses assume a danger in this study, and due to the fact that suicides most frequently occur shortly prior to or during the discharge process, an expansion of or the introduction of the assessment is recommended before the discharge process.

AB Suicide in adolescents is the second most common cause of death in this age group and an important public health problem. We examined sociodemographic factors associated with suicide in Swiss adolescents and analysed time trends in youth suicide in the Swiss National Cohort (SNC). The SNC is a longitudinal study of the whole Swiss resident population, based on linkage of census and mortality records. We identified suicides in adolescents aged 10-18 years from 1991 to 2013. A total of 2.396 million adolescents were included and 592 suicides were recorded, corresponding to a rate of 3.7 per 100,000 [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.4-4.0]. Rates increased with age from 0.0 per 100,000 at age 10 years to 14.8 per 100,000 (95% CI 12.6-17.5) at 18 years in boys, and from 0.0 to 5.4 per 100,000 (4.1-7.2) in girls. Being a boy, living in a single parent household, being an only or middle-born child, and living in rural regions were factors associated with a higher rate of suicide. Hanging was the most common method in boys, and railway suicides were most frequent in girls. There was no clear evidence for an increase or decrease over calendar time. We conclude that familial and socioeconomic factors including type of household, birth order and urbanity are associated with youth suicide in Switzerland. These factors should be considered when designing prevention programmes for youth suicide.

ID SWITZERLAND; LIFE
AB For a wider project on aging in prison, the authors interviewed 35 older prisoners and 24 stakeholders (prison staff, prison healthcare professionals, and policy makers) about healthcare for prisoners. In all, 6 prisoners and 3 stakeholders spontaneously expressed their attitudes concerning assisted suicide. Some prisoners seek assisted suicide for medical reasons and others because they regard spending the rest of their lives in prison as undignified. However, stakeholders identified several ethical and practical challenges in providing assisted suicide to prisoners. This article presents these perspectives on assisted suicide in prison and provides an ethical analysis of the issues raised.

AB To examine the characteristics of suicide attempters among first and second generation immigrants from Turkey living in Basel-City, Switzerland. All immigrants living in Basel City and admitted to the University Hospital of Basel-City, Switzerland, after a suicide attempt, were consecutively examined during a 7-year period (n=70). 35,7% of the suicide attempters were first generation and 64,3% second generation immigrants. Among the first generation the sex ratio female to male was 1,3 and among second generation 3,1. 36,9% of those concerned were at immigration 15 to 19 years of age. 24,1 % of females from first generation and 14,7% of females from second generation mentioned violence in family and partnership as the main problem. Conclusions: Female migrants of 2. generation seem to be at risk with regard to suicidal behavior. Violence seems to be a significant problem in suicidal female immigrants of both generations.

AB In the course of a large epidemiological study in the region of Basle, Switzerland, from 1992 to 1996, a considerable rise in suicides assisted by the right-to-die society EXIT was uncovered after wide press coverage of an assisted double suicide of a prominent couple in that region in March 1995. Further investigation revealed that the rise of assisted suicides for a period of 2 years after the critical event was statistically significant compared to the 2 years previous to the double suicide. This was especially true for women older than 65 years. Hence, the almost enthusiastic kind of reporting about this event was apt to induce imitation suicides or a "Werther-effect."

AB Annually, approximately 1300 people commit suicide in Switzerland. Whilst general practitioners play a crucial role in the prevention of suicide, suicidal patients are a huge burden on physicians. The risk factors for suicide are well known but a comprehensive assessment of the suicide risk calls for an evaluation of the individual resources. Most at risk are those who have previously attempted suicide; the risk of repetition remains elevated for years. Suicide in itself is not a disease but it is closely related to mental disorders. A critical issue in suicide prevention is the recognition and treatment of underlying disorders. Patients often refuse further therapy after an attempted suicide, probably due to communication problems between patients and mental health professionals. It will be demonstrated how it is nevertheless possible to establish a therapeutic alliance which would prove beneficial in a future crisis.

AB Objectives Assisted suicide in Switzerland is mainly performed by right-to-die societies. Medical involvement is limited to the prescription of the drug and certification of eligibility. Palliative care has traditionally been perceived as generally opposed to assisted suicide, but little is known about palliative care physicians' involvement in assisted suicide practices. This paper aims to describe their perspectives and involvement in assisted suicide practices.
   Methods A qualitative interview study was conducted with 23 palliative care physicians across Switzerland. Thematic analysis was used to interpret data.
   Results Swiss palliative care physicians regularly receive assisted suicide requests while none reported having received specific training in managing these requests. Participants reported being involved in assisted suicide decision making most were not willing to prescribe the lethal drug. After advising patients of the limits on their involvement in assisted suicide, the majority explored the origins of the patient's request and offered alternatives. Many participants struggled to reconcile their understanding of palliative care principles with patients' wishes to exercise their autonomy. The majority of participants had no direct contact with right-to-die societies, many desired better collaboration. A desire was voiced for a more structured debate on assisted suicide availability in hospitals and clearer legal and institutional frameworks.
   Conclusions The Swiss model of assisted suicide gives palliative care physicians opportunities to develop roles which are compatible with each practitioner's values, but may not correspond to patients' expectations. Specific education for all palliative care professionals and more structured ways to manage communication about assisted suicide are warranted.

AB Amongst the latest, and ever-changing, pathways of death and dying, "suicide tourism" presents distinctive ethical, legal and practical challenges. The international media report that citizens from across the world are travelling or seeking to travel to Switzerland, where they hope to be helped to die. In this paper I aim to explore three issues associated with this phenomenon: how to define "suicide tourism" and "assisted suicide tourism", in which the suicidal individual is helped to travel to take up the option of assisted dying; the (il)legality of assisted suicide tourism, particularly in the English legal system where there has been considerable recent activity; and the ethical dimensions of the practice. I will suggest that the suicide tourist-and specifically any accomplice thereof risks springing a legal trap, but that there is good reason to prefer a more tolerant policy, premised on compromise and ethical pluralism.

AB Death, like many social problems, has become medicalized. In response to this medicalization, physician-assisted suicide (PAS) has emerged as one alternative among many at the end of life. And although the practice is currently legal in the states of Oregon and Washington, opponents still argue that PAS is unethical, is inconsistent with a physician's role, and cannot be effectively regulated. In comparison, Switzerland, like Oregon, permits PAS, but unlike Oregon, non-physicians and private organizations play a significant role in assisted death. Could the Swiss model be the answer ? The following essay explores the Swiss model of assisted suicide for its potential to enhance the regulation of PAS, reduce physician involvement, and perhaps demedicalize the way we die.

AB Recent research suggests that search volumes of the most popular search engine worldwide, Google, provided via Google Trends, could be associated with national suicide rates in the USA, UK, and some Asian countries. However, search volumes have mostly been studied in an ad hoc fashion, without controls for spurious associations. This study evaluated the validity and utility of Google Trends search volumes for behavioral forecasting of suicide rates in the USA, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Suicide-related search terms were systematically collected and respective Google Trends search volumes evaluated for availability. Time spans covered 2004 to 2010 (USA, Switzerland) and 2004 to 2012 (Germany, Austria). Temporal associations of search volumes and suicide rates were investigated with time-series analyses that rigorously controlled for spurious associations. The number and reliability of analyzable search volume data increased with country size. Search volumes showed various temporal associations with suicide rates. However, associations differed both across and within countries and mostly followed no discernable patterns. The total number of significant associations roughly matched the number of expected Type I errors. These results suggest that the validity of Google Trends search volumes for behavioral forecasting of national suicide rates is low. The utility and validity of search volumes for the forecasting of suicide rates depend on two key assumptions ("the population that conducts searches consists mostly of individuals with suicidal ideation", "suicide-related search behavior is strongly linked with suicidal behavior"). We discuss strands of evidence that these two assumptions are likely not met. Implications for future research with Google Trends in the context of suicide research are also discussed.

AB Although relatively rare, suicide is a leading cause of death in children and adolescents in the Western world. This study examined whether children and adolescents are drawn to other methods of suicide than adults. Swiss suicides from 1998 to 2007 were examined. The main methods of suicide were analysed with respect to age and gender. Of the 12,226 suicides which took place in this 10-year period, 333 were committed by children and adolescents (226 males, 107 females). The most prevalent methods of suicide in children and adolescents 0-19 years were hanging, jumping from heights and railway-suicides (both genders), intoxication (females) and firearms (males). Compared to adults, railway-suicides were over-represented in young males and females (both P < .001). Jumping from heights was over-represented in young males (P < .001). Thus, availability has an important effect on methods of suicide chosen by children and adolescents. Restricting access to most favoured methods of suicide might be an important strategy in suicide prevention.

AB In Switzerland, the highest rates of suicide are observed in persons without religious affiliation and the lowest in Catholics, with Protestants in an intermediate position. We examined whether this association was modified by concomitant psychiatric diagnoses or malignancies, based on 6,909 suicides (ICD-10 codes X60-X84) recorded in 3.69 million adult residents 20012008. Suicides were related to mental illness or cancer if codes F or C, respectively, were mentioned on the death certificate. The protective effect of religion was substantially stronger if a diagnosis of cancer was mentioned on the death certificate and weaker if a mental illness was mentioned.

AB Background: Homicide-suicides are rare but catastrophic events. This study examined the epidemiology of homicide-suicide in Switzerland.
   Methods: The study identified homicide-suicide events 1991-2008 in persons from the same household in the Swiss National Cohort, which links census and mortality records. The analysis examined the association of the risk of dying in a homicide-suicide event with socio-demographic variables, measured at the individual-level, household composition variables and area-level variables. Proportional hazards regression models were calculated for male perpetrators and female victims. Results are presented as age-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).
   Results: The study identified 158 deaths from homicide-suicide events, including 85 murder victims (62 women, 4 men, 19 children and adolescents) and 68 male and 5 female perpetrators. The incidence was 3 events per million households and year. Firearms were the most prominent method for both homicides and suicides. The risk of perpetrating homicide-suicide was higher in divorced than in married men (HR 3.64; 95%CI 1.56-8.49), in foreigners without permanent residency compared to Swiss citizens (HR 3.95; 1.52-10.2), higher in men without religious affiliations than in Catholics (HR 2.23; 1.14-4.36) and higher in crowded households (HR 4.85; 1.72-13.6 comparing >= 2 with <1 persons/room). There was no association with education, occupation or nationality, the number of children, the language region or degree of urbanicity. Associations were similar for female victims.
   Conclusions: This national longitudinal study shows that living conditions associated with psychological stress and lower levels of social support are associated with homicide-suicide events in Switzerland.

AB Purpose: To assess violent death rates and trends between 1969 and 1997 among young people aged 10 - 24 years old in Switzerland. Methods: Total causes of death, all external causes of injuries, traffic injuries, suicides and overdoses were retrieved from the databank of the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (SFSO), using the eighth and tenth revisions of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Mortality rates per 100,000 individuals were computed by gender and by age ( 10 - 14, 15 - 19, 20 - 24) using census records as denominators. Results: In 1995 - 1997, violent deaths represented the primary cause of fatalities among young people. Rates of violent death were much higher among males than among females, with a ratio of 3.5: 1 in 1995 - 1997 and also became increasingly elevated from the age range of 10 - 14 to 20 - 24 years (1.9: 1 - 4.4: 1). In 1995 - 1997, violent deaths accounted for 66% (n = 1221) of all fatalities among young people. Among violent deaths, 36% were due to traffic injuries, 13% to other types of injuries, 32% to suicide, 15% to overdoses, 3% to homicides and 1% to undetermined intent. Between 1969 and 1997, rates of traffic injuries decreased in both genders and in the three age groups considered, while rates of suicide remained stable and rates of overdoses stabilised during the nineties after a sharp increase during the eighties. Conclusion: Although violent deaths in Switzerland have become significantly less frequent over the last 30 years, they still represent the single greatest cause of fatalities among young people and, as such, constitute a major public health challenge.

AB Objective: High rates of suicide have been described in HIV-infected patients, but it is unclear to what extent the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has affected suicide rates. The authors examined time trends and predictors of suicide in the pre-HAART (1988-1995) and HAART (1996-2008) eras in HIV-infected patients and the general population in Switzerland.
   Method: The authors analyzed data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study and the Swiss National Cohort, a longitudinal study of mortality in the Swiss general population. The authors calculated standardized mortality ratios comparing HIV-infected patients with the general population and used Poisson regression to identify risk factors for suicide.
   Results: From 1988 to 2008, 15,275 patients were followed in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study for a median duration of 4.7 years. Of these, 150 died by suicide (rate 158.4 per 100,000 person-years). In men, standardized mortality ratios declined from 13.7 (95% CI= 11.0-17.0) in the pre-HAART era to 3.5 (95% CI= 2.5-4.8) in the late HAART era. In women, ratios declined from 11.6 (95% CI= 6.4-20.9) to 5.7 (95% CI= 3.2-10.3). In both periods, suicide rates tended to be higher in older patients, in men, in injection drug users, and in patients with advanced clinical stage of HIV illness. An increase in CD4 cell counts was associated with a reduced risk of suicide.
   Conclusions: Suicide rates decreased significantly with the introduction of HAART, but they remain above the rate observed in the general population, and risk factors for suicide remain similar. HIV-infected patients remain an important target group for suicide prevention.

AB Few population-based surveys in Europe have examined the link between suicidality and sexual orientation. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalences of and risk for suicidality by sexual orientation, especially among adolescent and young adult men. Data came from three probability-based surveys in Switzerland from 2002: 1) Geneva Gay Men's Health Survey (GGMHS) with 571 gay/bisexual men, 2) Swiss Multicenter Adolescent Survey on Health (SMASH) with 7,428 16-20 year olds, and 3) Swiss Recruit Survey (ch-x) with 22,415 new recruits. In GGMHS, suicidal ideation (12 months/lifetime) was reported by 22%/55%, suicide plans 12%/38%, and suicide attempts 4%/19%. While lifetime prevalences and ratios are similar across age groups, men under 25 years reported the highest 12-month prevalences for suicidal ideation (35.4%) and suicide attempts (11.5%) and the lowest attempt ratios (1:1.5 for attempt to plan and 1:3.1 for attempt to ideation). The lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts among homo/bisexual men aged 16-20 years varies from 5.1% in ch-x to 14.1% in SMASH to 22.0% in GGMHS. Compared to their heterosexual counterparts, significantly more homo/bisexual men reported 12-month suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts (OR = 2.09-2.26) and lifetime suicidal ideation (OR = 2.15) and suicide attempts (OR = 4.68-5.36). Prevalences and ratios vary among gay men by age and among young men by both sexual orientation and study population. Lifetime prevalences and ratios of non-fatal suicidal behaviors appear constant across age groups as is the increased risk of suicidality among young homo/bisexual men. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background Homicide-suicide and domestic homicide without consecutive suicide might be regarded as an extreme form of domestic violence. According to the national crime-register, however, there might be some relevant differences between the perpetrators of the two.
   Method The files of all cases of homicide-suicide (n = 24) and of all cases of domestic homicide without suicide (n = 21), which had been examined at the Institute of forensic medicine in Basle between 1987 und 2006, were compared.
   Results Perpetrators of domestic homicide without suicide were significantly younger, had a poorer educational background and were rather foreigners. About two thirds of the perpetrators of homicide-suicide used a gun compared with only one third of those committing domestic homicide.
   Discussion Measures as they are known from suicide prevention programmes like limiting the access to lethal instruments like guns might be useful in the case of homicide-suicide, measures for the prevention of domestic homicide should aim at better integration and education of the perpetrators and their family.

AB Among the different research methods on suicide notes, the theoretical conceptual approach allows a particularly thorough understanding of the suicidal act. The present study focuses on 78 suicide notes collected in Geneva, Switzerland, between 2006 and 2014. The socio-demographic and medical data of the writers' notes were collected. The conceptual content of the notes was analyzed by two independent raters using the Leenaars method. The results showed that the concepts that appeared most frequently in the notes were: Inability to adjust, Rejection-aggression, Unbearable pain, and Ego. Very few differences were found in the conceptual content when stratified for age, gender, socio-economic status, or religion. This study confirms and complements the findings of similar studies on the content of suicide notes.

AB This study on suicide attempts is part of a large research project on dependent behavior in adolescents and young adults. 228 subjects aged 14-25 (107 "drug abusers," 121 controls) from the French speaking part of Switzerland were evaluated on the basis of a semi-structured interview (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview), enabling a DSM-IV diagnosis, and self-reports (SSS by Zuckermann, MMPI-2, IDI by Hirschfeld). 31.5% of "drug abuser" males and 41.2% of "drug abuser" females committed one or snore suicide attempts. The results of a logistic regression show that the significant factor explaining suicide attempts in drug users is emotional reliance for males and experience-seeking for females.

AB Homicides followed by the suicide of the perpetrator constitute a serious form of interpersonal violence. Until now no study has directly compared homicide-suicides to other violent deaths from multiple countries, allowing for a better understanding of the nature of these violent acts. Using country-specific data, this study describes and compares the incidence and patterns of homicide-suicide as well as the relationship between homicide-suicide, homicide, suicide and domestic homicide in the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United States. The results indicate that cross-nationally, homicide-suicides are more likely than other types of lethal violence to involve a female victim, multiple victims, take place in a residential setting and to be committed by a firearm. Although homicide-suicides display many similarities across the different countries, differences exist regarding age and the use of firearms in the offence. This study indicates that homicides followed by suicides differ from both homicides and suicides in similar ways internationally. Cross-national differences in the availability of firearms may explain the international variation of homicide-suicide rates and patterns. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We assess (i) whether being married is a protective factor against socio-economic inequalities in suicide, and (ii) whether any such buffering effect varies between countries. We used the data from a European cross-national comparison project, a prospective follow-up of several European population censuses matched with vital statistics. The data encompass 99.5 million person-years aged 30 and above and, 25,476 suicides in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Turin, Madrid, Norway and Switzerland. Standardised rates were computed and logistic regressions were used to assess educational inequalities. Among the non-married, the lower educational group had an increased risk of dying of suicide compared to the higher group (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.45). Inequalities among the married were lower (OR = 1.29). In all countries or regions except Austria, the lower educational group had a higher risk of suicide mortality among the non-married than among the married. The buffering effect of being married was not observed for elderly individuals (65 and over). Among younger individuals, the buffering effect of being married on relative inequalities in suicide was stronger in Madrid, Denmark, Norway and Switzerland (but significant only for Denmark and Norway). There was no indication that countries with stronger welfare policies or lower divorce rate had a lower buffering effect. We conclude that being married protects against inequalities in suicide and that this protective effect is not affected by the level of social capital at the country level. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

DT Article; Book Chapter
ID RATES; SWITZERLAND; HOMICIDE; FIREARMS; GAS
AB International studies show a positive correlation between the rate of households with guns, suicides and homicides with guns in a given country. Due to its unique defence system that requires a militia to keep personal firearms at home, Switzerland has a high rate of households with a gun and in fact, has one of the highest rates of firearm suicides in the world; precise figures, to what extent army weapons are involved, however, were lacking up to now. In order to obtain such data, the records of all suicides, that occurred in the region of Basle between 1992 and 1996 were reviewed. Suicides with either army weapons or private firearms and suicides by other means were compared and methods and types of homicides that occurred in the region at the same time were also analysed. Private firearms (18%) were clearly the most frequent means of suicide, army weapons (12%) ranked fourth. Firearms for suicide were mainly used by men, especially army weapons. Men who had used army weapons where younger, professionally better qualified and fewer had ever been treated in one of the local state psychiatric services. Army weapons were also used in 12% of all homicides, its absolute figure, however, was insignificantly small.
   Independently from this study, measures like an extended psychiatric-psychological assessment of future conscripts have been already introduced, but army-weapons with ammunition have still been left to the conscripts. Meanwhile, sufficient signatures in due time have been collected by political forces very critical towards the Swiss army to enforce about a referendum on the issue of no longer allowing conscripts to keep their personal weapon with ammunition at home.

AB Rates of suicide by jumping show large regional differences. Barriers on bridges may prevent suicides but also may lead to a substitution of jumping site or method. The aim of our study was to compare suicide data from regions with and without suicide bridges and to estimate the effects on method and site substitution if bridges were to be secured. In a national survey, suicide data for the years 1990 to 2003 were collected. Regions with high rates of bridge suicides were identified and compared with regions with low rates, and the analysis revealed that only about one third of the individuals would be expected to jump from buildings or other structures if no bridge was available. The results suggest no method substitution for women. For men, a trend of a substituting jumping by overdosing in regions without suicide bridges was found. We conclude that restricted access to suicide bridges will not automatically lead suicidal individuals to choose another jumping site or suicide method. The results support the notion that securing bridges may save lives.

TI The assisted suicide of Italians in Switzerland and the silence of
   psychiatry
SO RIVISTA DI PSICHIATRIA
LA Italian
DT Article
DE assisted dying; depression; euthanasia; suicide; assisted suicide
AB The debate on different forms of request of death has taken on a broad dimension in public opinion over last years, often referring on profoundly differentiated and often opposing positions of principle. Beyond cultural, political or ideal positions, a further critical issue, often underestimated or quite not considered, concerns a person's ability to express a valid consent to the request of death, according to the same criteria of validity of the informed consent to any medical act. This assumes particular importance in the case of assisted suicide. Assisted suicide represents a phenomenon in sharp growth in Western world. It is legal in many nations, and in Switzerland it is also allowed for foreign citizens, thus increasing the phenomenon of the so-called "tourism of suicide". In addition to neoplastic and neurological diseases, depression has also been accepted as a disease that makes assisted suicide possible. This imposes profound clinical and ethical considerations, since depression is unanimously recognized as a treatable disease and since in its most serious forms, such as those in which suicidal ideation dominates, it can compromise the patient's ability to express a valid consent to any medical act, including the assisted suicide. Furthermore, it is often overlooked that any serious and disabling somatic disease, source of intense and chronic suffering, carries the very high risk of the onset of unrecognized depressive conditions, able in turn to negatively influence the ability to express valid consent. Faced with this situation, which has involved a large number of Italian citizens in recent years, the personal and official voice of psychiatry is absolutely lacking, contrasting its silence with the opinions of those who do not want to take into account its potentially fundamental considerations.

AB BACKGROUND: This article presents epidemiological and clinical findings from the Basel research centre participating in the WHO/EURO Multicentre Study on Suicidal Behaviour.
   METHODS: Between January 2003 and December 2006, 984 suicide attempts were documented for patients presenting at medical institutions with a suicide attempt.
   RESULTS: The mean suicide attempt rate was 164/100,000 inhabitants. Women attempted suicide nearly twice as often as men. The highest suicide attempt rates were found for women aged 20-24 years, for men aged 30-34 years, and for people who were unmarried, of foreign nationality, and of low education or low employment status. 'Soft methods' were used significantly more often than 'hard methods'. Of the suicide attempt methods employed, a relatively high proportion was accounted for by self-poisoning with drugs (X60-64), especially with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, benzodiazepines and antidepressants. Significant gender differences were found in the various methods and in the frequency of psychiatric diagnoses. A total of 98.7% of the attempters were diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder according to ICD-10; 35% suffered from an affective disorder. Men were significantly more frequently affected by substance abuse disorder or psychosis, whereas in women adjustment disorders and personality disorders were diagnosed significantly more often.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study offers the first published representative data of an entire Swiss county. Established sociodemographic and clinical risk factors for suicide attempts were reproduced. The identification of risk factors contributes to developing local targeted prevention strategies, for example education of risk groups and care-givers, and pharmacolegal consequences for package sizes. Gender-and age-specific prevention and aftercare programmes are indicated.

TI Assisted Suicide in Switzerland An Analysis of Death Records From Swiss
   Institutes of Forensic Medicine
SO DEUTSCHES ARZTEBLATT INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: The aim of this research project, part of a program initiated by the Swiss Federal Council, was to trace the development of organized assisted suicide in Switzerland, starting from the very first case in 1985.
   Methods: Retrospective data on 3666 death records from Swiss institutes of forensic medicine for the years 1985 to 2014 were systematically compiled. read into a database, and for the most part quantitatively evaluated.
   Results: Alongside a marked increase in the overall number of assisted suicides since the turn of the century, the number of people traveling to Switzerland from other countries-predominantly Germany-for this purpose has risen steadily. The proportion of women was 60%, and the age at death ranged from 18 to 105 years (median 73). The largest diagnostic category was malignancy overall, neurological disease for those from other countries. The next largest category was age-related functional limitation, e.g., sensory impairment (loss of sight and hearing), the consequences of which were stated in writing as the reason for the wish to die. Following the Swiss Federal Court's promulgation of binding requirements in 2006. the documentation contained in the death records for the subsequent period up to 2014 is much more detailed, but still not uniform or even necessarily complete.
   Conclusion: The number of candidates for organized assisted suicide increased steadily during the study period, but no standard procedures were followed. The question therefore arises of whether further regulation or the introduction of a central registration office to maximize standardation and promote transparency would lead to improved quality assurance.

AB Objectives No consensus has been reached regarding the theoretical dimensions underlying the Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI) and Beck's Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSI), widely used in research and clinical practice. This undermines the understanding and management of suicidal behavior. Methods The factor structure of the SSI and the BSI was investigated in 201 patients visiting the emergency department of the Geneva University Hospital, Switzerland, for suicidal ideation or a suicide attempt. Results Exploratory factor analyses (EFAs) identified a unique theoretical dimension. Item removal based on analyses of communalities improved the explained part of variance in both scales. A joint factor analysis provided results very similar to those yielded by initial EFAs. Conclusions The single factor underlying the SSI and the BSI was composed of items encompassing a construct of suicide desire. Nonretained items corresponded to other elements of suicidal behavior (e.g., plans and preparations regarding the upcoming suicide attempt). These scales could not discriminate between suicide ideators and suicide attempters.

DE Forensic autopsy; Homicide-suicide; Geneva
AB This study provides a retrospective review from the forensic files of the University Centre of Legal Medicine in Western Switzerland in Geneva, from January 1956 to December 2005. The studied homicide-suicide cases cover a period of half a century (50 years). As a rule, all police-ordered forensic examinations of violent death cases in the Canton of Geneva are conducted by the University Centre of Legal Medicine. All of the data necessary for an exhaustive retrospective study are thus readily available. During the period covered in this work, 228 homicides were perpetrated in Geneva. In 23 cases, the homicide was followed by the suicide of the aggressor. The 34 victims of these homicides (18 women, 1 man and 15 children) had either an intimate or filial relationship with the perpetrator. Most of the suicidal perpetrators were men that killed their spouses or intimate partners, with children as additional victims in some cases. Shooting was the most common means to kill, followed by stabbing. The majority of the victims and perpetrators were Swiss nationals. This retrospective study shows that in the last 50 years, homicide-suicide cases in the Canton of Geneva have been a rare and an episodic phenomena with a very variable frequency from 1 year to another.

AB Homicide-suicides, the murder of one or several individuals followed by the suicide of the perpetrator, are rare but have devastating effects on families and communities. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing perpetrators of homicide-suicides with perpetrators of simple homicides and suicides and examined the proportion of firearm use and its correlation with firearm availability. We searched Medline and Embase from inception to July 2012 and identified 27 eligible studies. Perpetrators of homicide-suicides were older and more likely to be male and married to or separated from their victims than perpetrator of simple homicides or suicides. Influence of alcohol and a history of domestic violence or unemployment were less prevalent in homicide-suicides than in homicides. The proportion of firearm use in homicide-suicides varied across countries and was highest in the USA, Switzerland and South Africa, followed by Australia, Canada, The Netherlands and England and Wales, with a strong correlation between the use of firearms and the level of civilian gun ownership in the country. Our results indicate that homicide-suicides represent a distinct entity, with characteristics distinguishing them both from homicides and suicides. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The population, recruited in France, Belgium, and Switzerland, was composed of 570 subjects'(225 females, 345 males, mean age = 27.3, SD = 8.5). The subjects' psychological dimensions were investigated by means of several self-report questionnaires including: BDI-13 (Beck), Sensation-Seeking Scale (Zuckerman), Toronto Alexithymia Scale (Taylor), Interpersonal Dependency Inventory (Hirschfeld), MMPI-2, and some additional scales. For most dimensions, repeat attempters, both past and recent, but more specifically the recent repeaters, had a more severe psychological profile compared to the other suicide attempters.

AB Living in high-rise buildings could influence the health of residents. Previous studies focused on structural features of high-rise buildings or characteristics of their neighbourhoods, ignoring differences within buildings in socio-economic position or health outcomes. We examined mortality by floor of residence in the Swiss National Cohort, a longitudinal study based on the linkage of December 2000 census with mortality and emigration records 2001-2008. Analyses were based on 1.5 million people living in buildings with four or more floors and 142,390 deaths recorded during 11.4 million person-years of follow-up. Cox models were adjusted for age, sex, civil status, nationality, language, religion, education, professional status, type of household and crowding. The rent per m(2) increased with higher floors and the number of persons per room decreased. Mortality rates decreased with increasing floors: hazard ratios comparing the ground floor with the eighth floor and above were 1.22 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.15-1.28] for all causes, 1.40 (95 % CI 1.11-1.77) for respiratory diseases, 1.35 (95 % CI 1.22-1.49) for cardiovascular diseases and 1.22 (95 % CI 0.99-1.50) for lung cancer, but 0.41 (95 % CI 0.17-0.98) for suicide by jumping from a high place. There was no association with suicide by any means (hazard ratio 0.81; 95 % CI 0.57-1.15). We conclude that in Switzerland all-cause and cause-specific mortality varies across floors of residence among people living in high-rise buildings. Gradients in mortality suggest that floor of residence captures residual socioeconomic stratification and is likely to be mediated by behavioural (e.g. physical activity), and environmental exposures, and access to a method of suicide.

AB In Switzerland, assisted suicide developed outside of medical and juridical spaces, through activist associations. In the 1990s, intense confrontations between associations and the medico-administrative authorities led to the adoption of a moratorium on assisted suicide for people with mental disorders. It is in this context that a criminal trial was instituted against the psychiatrist Peter Baumann who broke this moratorium by helping an individual, Andreas U, to put an end to his life. The article highlights the heterogeneity of the positions of the actors involved in this case in terms of assessing Andreas U's capacity for discernment, the nature of the assessment made by Baumann, and the legitimacy of his actions. Through the study of the transformations of judgments rendered, from the first instance to the cantonal Parliament, the article illuminates tensions within the Swiss model of assisted suicide.

AB The annual suicide rate in South Korea is the highest among the developed countries. Paraquat is a highly lethal herbicide, commonly used in South Korea as a means for suicide. We have studied the effect of the 2011 paraquat prohibition on the national suicide rate and method of suicide in South Korea. We obtained the monthly suicide rate from 2005 to 2013 in South Korea. In our analyses, we adjusted for the effects of celebrity suicides, and economic, meteorological, and seasonal factors on suicide rate. We employed change point analysis to determine the effect of paraquat prohibition on suicide rate over time, and the results were verified by structural change analysis, an alternative statistical method. After the paraquat prohibition period in South Korea, there was a significant reduction in the total suicide rate and suicide rate by poisoning with herbicides or fungicides in all age groups and in both genders. The estimated suicide rates during this period decreased by 10.0% and 46.1% for total suicides and suicides by poisoning of herbicides or fungicides, respectively. In addition, method substitution effect of paraquat prohibition was found in suicide by poisoning by carbon monoxide, which did not exceed the reduction in the suicide rate of poisoning with herbicides or fungicides. In South Korea, paraquat prohibition led to a lower rate of suicide by paraquat poisoning, as well as a reduction in the overall suicide rate. Paraquat prohibition should be considered as a national suicide prevention strategy in developing and developed countries alongside careful observation for method substitution effects.

AB Frequency and gender differences of psychiatric medication intake in a sample of suicide victims from the Athens Greater Area were investigated with a particular focus on the implications for suicide prevention. Data were collected from the toxicological analyses of the suicide cases of the period November 2007-October 2009. Information was available for 262 individuals, 196 men (74.8%) and 66 women (25.2%); 109 of these (41.6%) were receiving psychiatric medication(s). Women were statistically more frequently under treatment: antidepressants (32.8% vs. 11.3%, p < 0.001), antiepileptics (9.1% vs. 0.5%, p = 0.001), antipsychotics (24.2% vs. 9.2%, p = 0.003), and benzodiazepines (16.7% vs. 6.6%, p = 0.024). Campaigns aiming to bring men with psychological difficulties in contact with mental health services and to lessen the stigma of mental illness, together with better training of nonpsychiatrists into "suspecting" "male" depression, could be particularly helpful for decreasing male suicides. More thoughtful choice of psychiatric medication could possibly already prevent a number of female suicides.

AB Suicides in Geneva in those less than 25 years old, from 1993 to 2002, were reviewed. Scenes investigations, autopsy findings, toxicology results, and psychiatric history (when available) were examined. There were 65 cases. The average annual suicide rate was 11/100,000. Seventy-seven percent were male, and 23% were female. The youngest was 12 years old and most of the victims were 18 years old and over (89%). For men, the use of firearms was the most common method (38%), followed by fall from height (16%) and drowning (10%). For women, fall from height was the most frequent (40%), followed by firearms and medication overdoses (20% each), hanging (13%), and drowning (7%). Toxicological analysis was performed in 41% of the cases and showed that alcohol was present in 26% and other drugs in 67% of these cases. The most common drugs present were benzodiazepines, cannabis, and cocaine.

AB A year after Mario Monicelli's suicide, the death of another famous person in Italy, Lucio Magri, reawakened the Italian debate on social, ethical and juridical issues in end-of-life decisions. Unlike Monicelli, Lucio Magri decided to end his own life in Switzerland with the help of a physician because his mental illness rendered his life unbearable. Both Monicelli and Magri suffered from a severe depression. The authors analyze the ethical issues regarding the right to die for mentally ill patients and neurological disabled patients, discussing the decision-making autonomy in persons suffering from severe depression. The role of the psychiatry in the management of end-of-life decision requests is considered along with pros and cons of suicide prevention and rationale suicide.

AB . Suicide has become one of the leading causes of death of Swiss males aged between 15 and 44 years, whose age-standardized rates are about three times higher than those for females. We compared age-stratified suicide rates of Swiss men and women aged 1579 years and analysed gender-specific differences from 1950 to 2007. Furthermore, we explored whether changes in measures of family integration can explain changes in suicide trends. The use of multivariate ageperiodcohort models avoids age aggregation and allows the exploration of heterogeneous time trends across age, period and birth cohort. In addition, explanatory variables can be included. We found strong gender-specific differences in suicide mortality. Although the same risk factors may act on age and overdispersion, there was no significant correlation between gender-specific cohort effects. Family integration had an effect on Swiss suicide risk but only partially explained the underlying trends over time.

AB Research has shown that there are different seasonal effects in suicide. The aim of this study is to demonstrate that the decrease in suicide rate at the end of the year is extended over the last weeks of the year and represents a specific type of seasonal effect. Suicide data were extracted firom individual records of the Swiss mortality statistics, 1969-2003. The data were aggregated to daily frequencies of suicide across the year. Specifically, the period October-February was examined using time-series analysis, i.e., the Box-Jenkins approach with intervention models. The time series models require a step function to account for the gradual drop in suicide frequencies in December. The decrease in suicide frequencies includes the whole Advent and is accentuated at Christmas. After the New Year, there is a sharp recovery in men's suicide rate but not in women's. The reduction in the suicide rate during the last weeks of the year exceeds the well-recognised effect of reduced rates on major public holidays. It involves valuable challenges for suicide prevention such as timing of campaigns and enhancement of social networks. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The death by assisted suicide in Switzerland of Australian Dr. John Elliott, in early 2007 has highlighted the inadequacy of the law pertaining to medical decisions at end-of-life, both from a legal as well as ethical perspective. Despite being illegal in most jurisdictions around the world, physician-assisted death is a reality, in part because of the flexibility, inconsistent application and, at times, invisibility, of laws surrounding it. The appropriate response to this should be greater transparency by a reform of the law.

AB In Switzerland, the practice of lay right-to-die societies (RTDS) organizing assisted suicide (AS) is tolerated by the state. Patient counseling and accompaniment into the dying process is overtaken by RTDS lay members, while the role of physicians may be restricted to prescribing the mortal dose after a more or less rigorous exploration of the patient's decisional capacity. However, Swiss health care facilities and professionals are committed to providing suicide prevention. Despite the liberal attitude in society, the legitimacy of organized AS is ethically questioned. How can health professionals be supported in their moral uncertainty when confronted with patient wishes for suicide? As an approach towards reaching this objective, two ethics policies were developed at the Basel University Hospital to offer orientation in addressing twofold and divergent duties: handling requests for AS and caring for patients with suicidal thoughts or after a suicide attempt. According to the Swiss tradition of consultation (Vernehmlassung), controversial views were acknowledged in the interdisciplinary policy development processes. Both institutional policies mirror the clash of values and suggest consistent ways to meet the challenges: respect and tolerance regarding a patient's wish for AS on the one hand, and the determination to offer help and prevent harm by practicing suicide prevention on the other. Given the legal framework lacking specific norms for the practice of RTDS, orientation is sought in ethical guidelines. The comparison between the previous and newly revised guideline of the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences reveals, in regard to AS, a shift from the medical criterion, end of life is near, to a patient rights focus, i.e., decisional capacity, consistent with the law. Future experience will show whether and how this change will be integrated into clinical practice. In this process, institutional ethics policies mayin addition to the law, national guidelines, or medical standardsbe helpful in addressing conflicting duties at the bedside. The article offers an interdisciplinary theoretical reflection with practical illustration.

ID RISK
AB Background: Suicide is the leading cause of death in Swiss prisons. The Federal Statistics Office provides numbers but no further details. Previous studies worldwide have focused on identifying suicide risk factors in prisoners, but very few have looked at the methods used in relation to prevention strategies. Aims: To obtain details of Swiss prison suicides, determine new findings in an international context, and establish prevention strategies based on the information acquired. Method: Retrospective data analysis of prison suicides extracted from the database of all suicides investigated by Swiss institutes of legal medicine between 2000 and 2010, using a standardized assessment sheet. Results: Out of 4,885 suicides investigated in the institutes of legal medicine in Switzerland, we identified 50 (1.02%) inmate suicides. Most were unmarried Swiss men, with a median age of 32 years. The two most common methods used were hanging and tricyclic antidepressant overdose. Two died due to self-immolation. Conclusion: Swiss prison suicides do not differ from those in other countries regarding sociodemographic details and the most common method of hanging. Anchoring devices, even low ones, should be avoided to prevent hanging and medication intake should be monitored. As prisoners use tricyclic antidepressants to die by suicide, we recommend the general monitoring of intake.

AB Psychiatrists, epidemiologists, and sociologists have debated the existence of an association between weather conditions and suicide seasonality since the preliminary statistical investigations in the 19th century. Provided that the effect of weather conditions on suicide operates via a dose-response-like mechanism, time-series (Box-Jenkins) analysis permits an indirect test of the hypothesis that temperature or other weather variables promote higher suicide frequencies in late spring and early summer months. The authors modeled monthly data on suicide and climatic conditions (i.e., temperature, sunshine, and precipitation data) in Switzerland. Cross-correlations between the filtered (prewhitened) residual series were calculated for the period 1881-2000, for consecutive 30-year periods, for different suicide methods, and-with regard to the seasonality hypothesis-for series relying on moving 1- and 3-month frames. Positive cross-correlations emerged between suicide and temperature data for the whole time series, as well as in all consecutive 30-year periods. However, cross-correlations of data series based on moving frames showed a minor peak in associations for summer frames and a major peak in associations for winter frames, the latter reflecting suicides performed mainly outdoors (being run over by a train and jumping from high places). The results represent a novel minor effect in seasonality of suicide, which is hardly compatible with the hypothesized role of temperature in suicide seasonality.

AB Background: Mental health and social professionals are at high risk of experiencing at least one patient suicide during their career. Aims: This paper investigates the impact of patient suicide on the reactions and working practices of mental health and social professionals. It also examines how such an impact may vary depending on the professionals' characteristics, their relationship with the patient, as well as the institutional setting in which they work. Methods: 275 professionals working in sociomedical institutions in French-speaking Switzerland completed a questionnaire. Results: Patient suicide can cause a wide range of long-lasting reactions and changes in the working practices of mental health and social professionals. Professional's gender, place of suicide, as well as responsibility for and emotional attachment to the patient significantly influence the impact that a patient suicide has on such professionals. Professional's age, the type of profession, the number of suicides experienced, and previous suicide attempts by the deceased patient were also found to play a significant role with regard to changes in working practices. Conclusions: Beyond the emotional and professional impact, patient suicide may have also a formative influence, encouraging professionals to review and improve their working practices. Recommendations to help mental health and social professionals who have experienced a patient suicide are discussed.

ID NONVIOLENT SUICIDE; SEX DIFFERENCE; VIOLENT; TRENDS
AB In general, suicide frequencies peak in spring and early summer and depict a low in autumn and winter months. Suicide seasonality is a ubiquitous phenomenon; however, recent studies have indicated that it is related particularly to violent suicide methods. We investigated differences in suicide seasonalities by suicide methods using Swiss mortality data. The suicide data were extracted from the Swiss cause of death statistics and cover the period 1969-1994. In this period 37,518 suicides (ICD-8 codes 950-959) were registered in the mortality statistics. The data were analysed by the Edwards' method, which examines unimodal sinusoidal patterns in aggregated monthly data, and by spectral analysis with disaggregated monthly data. Overall, Swiss suicide data in 1969-1994 depict the expected pattern with a peak in May and June and a low in December. However, analyses by suicide methods show that there is no common pattern. Suicide seasonalities are absent or weak in some violent as well as non-violent methods (firearms, cutting, crashing, poisoning). Even if clearly present (hanging, drowning, jumping from high places, unspecified/other), the seasonalities show distinct patterns and cycles. Apart from sinusoidal patterns, there are also outliers: in overall data as well as in most method-specific data, the December frequencies fall more than 10% below the neighbouring months. The decrease of the frequencies culminates at Christmas/New Year and then returns to average levels. Hence, the seasonality of the overall Swiss suicide frequencies is but a compound seasonality. It largely depends on specific suicide methods and different cyclical dynamics. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study, which was carried out in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, was to examine the relationship between suicide attempts and self-mutilation by adolescents and young adults. The population, aged 14-25 years (N = 308), included a clinical sample of dependent subjects (drug abuse and eating disorders) compared to a control sample. On the basis of the Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview (Sheehan et al., 1998), DSM-IV criteria were used for the inclusion of the clinical population. The results concerning the occurrence of suicide attempts as well as on self-mutilation confirm most of the hypotheses postulated: suicidal attempts and self-mutilation were more common in the clinical group compared to the control group, and there was a correlation between suicide attempts and self-mutilation. However, there was only a partial overlap, attesting that suicide and self-harm might correspond to two different types of behaviour.

AB Suicides due to fall from height in Geneva from 1991 to 2000 were reviewed. Scene investigations, autopsy findings, psychiatric histories, and toxicology results were examined. There were 197 of these suicides, an incidence of five cases per 100 000 inhabitants per year or one fourth of all suicides in Geneva per year. Autopsies were performed on 33%, the rest had external examinations. Of the victims, 56% were female and 44% were male. The age distribution peaked at 20-29 years in men and 60-69 years in women. Most of the victims jumped from their home, the range of 2 to 7 stories being the most frequent height. Major injury sites, in decreasing frequency, were the thorax, abdomen, skull, vertebrae, pelvis and limbs. Psychiatric illness was reported in 38% of the cases. Toxicological analysis was performed in 25% of the cases and showed that the main drugs present were benzodiazepines, cannabis and antidepressant.

AB The passive form of euthanasia is legalized almost in every civilized country. Its active form is not a generally accepted legal institution. In Europe, active euthanasia is legalized only in The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland. In Australia, the Act on the Rights of the Terminally Ill of 1995 legalized the institution of assisted suicide, which is not identical to active euthanasia. The difference lies in the fact that legalized active euthanasia means that the author of a murder is not punishable (under certain circumstances), whilst assisted suicide is not about murder, rather about suicide. In the first case, the patient is killed on his or her request by someone else. In the second case, the patient himself or herself executes the act of self-killing (by the assistance of a healthcare worker). In Australia, the institution of assisted suicide was repealed in 1997. Assisted suicide is legal in four USA member states: in Vermont, Washington, Montana and Oregon. In Uruguay, the active form of euthanasia has been legal since 1932.

TI Suicide assisted by two Swiss right-to-die organisations
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
ID NETHERLANDS; EUTHANASIA; SWITZERLAND; GENDER
AB Background: In Switzerland, non-medical right-to-die organisations such as Exit Deutsche Schweiz and Dignitas offer suicide assistance to members suffering from incurable diseases.
   Objectives: First, to determine whether differences exist between the members who received assistance in suicide from Exit Deutsche Schweiz and Dignitas. Second, to investigate whether the practices of Exit Deutsche Schweiz have changed since the 1990s.
   Methods: This study analysed all cases of assisted suicide facilitated by Exit Deutsche Schweiz (E) and Dignitas (D) between 2001 and 2004 and investigated by the University of Zurich's Institute of Legal Medicine (E: n = 147; D: n = 274, total: 421). Furthermore, data from the Exit Deutsche Schweiz study which investigated all cases of assisted suicide during the period 1990-2000 (n = 149) were compared with the data of the present study.
   Results: More women than men were assisted in both organisations (D: 64%; E: 65%). Dignitas provided more assistance to non-residents (D: 91%; E: 3%; p = 0.000), younger persons (mean age in years (SD): D: 64.5 (14.1); E: 76.6 (13.3); p = 0.001), and people suffering from fatal diseases such as multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (D: 79%; E: 67%; p = 0.013). Lethal medications were more often taken orally in cases assisted by Dignitas (D: 91%; E: 76%; p = 0.000). The number of women and the proportion of older people suffering from non-fatal diseases among suicides assisted by Exit Deutsche Schweiz has increased since the 1990s (women: 52% to 65%, p = 0.031; mean age in years (SD): 69.3 (17.0) to 76.9 (13.3), p = 0.000), non-fatal diseases: 22% to 34%, p = 0.026).
   Conclusions: Weariness of life rather than a fatal or hopeless medical condition may be a more common reason for older members of Exit Deutsche Schweiz to commit suicide. The strong over-representation of women in both Exit Deutsche Schweiz and Dignitas suicides is an important phenomenon so far largely overlooked and in need of further study.

AB Objectives Many psychiatrists and psychologists are likely to experience a patient suicide at a point in their professional career. The present paper examines the effects of patient suicide on psychiatrists' and psychologists' professional reactions and working practices and investigates factors that may affect the severity of repercussions on their professional lives.
   Method Data from 271 psychiatrists and psychologists working in various institutional settings and in private practice in French-speaking Switzerland were collected by a written questionnaire.
   Results Psychiatrists and psychologists reported a range of professional reactions and changes in working practices following a patient suicide. Professional reactions and changes in working practices were more significant among women. The length of therapy and the emotional closeness with the deceased patient were predictive of a greater impact. In contrast, social and psychological support served as a protective factor by reducing negative repercussions on professional practice. Finally, the impact of losing a patient to suicide did not differ between psychiatrists and psychologists in institutional settings and those in private practice.
   Conclusion Although patient suicide affected the professional life of psychiatrists and psychologists, it also encouraged them to review and adjust their working practices.

AB Introduction: Spirituality and religion have only been marginally investigated in the experiences of the bereaved by suicide (or survivors of suicide). Aim: This article directly addresses two questions: In what way was spirituality or religion an issue for survivors of suicide? How were they helpful (or not) during their reconstruction process? Method: Research involved qualitative studies, carried out in Switzerland with 50 survivors of suicide using in depth-interviews. Data were analyzed according to grounded theory principles. Results: Suicide triggered questioning mainly about the afterlife of the deceased and of how transcendency relates to agency and responsibility in the suicidal act. Spiritual or religious issues play an important role in the process of reconstruction for survivors, notably in meaning-making and responsibility-clarifying processes, in forging a continuing bond with the deceased and in honoring their life and memory. Nevertheless, this role is complex and can either support or make the recovery difficult (or both). Conclusion: Mental health and social care professionals may support survivors' resilience and their reconstruction process by valuing the constructive aspects of their spiritual and religious experiences and by taking into account the spiritual and religious struggles they face to offer effective support to survivors of suicide during recovery.

AB "Suicidal tendencies in everyday-life discourse: Popular interpretations of suicide in the 20th century". Starting with gender specific suicide rates, this essay analyzes popular interpretations of suicide in the 20th century in german-speaking countries. Under the term suicidal tendencies, all thoughts, notices, attempts and committed suicides are summarized. In a first step it will be shown that suicide was for both men and women a topic of autobiographical writing. They used the German term "Selbstmord" in a neutral way without judging the deed morally. After this the insignificance of religion for populate interpretations of suicide will be demonstrated. The next chapter analyzes the scope of popular explications of suicidal tendencies. Focusing on "Social relations" popular explanations resembled psychoanalytic ones. That was not the case for pathologizing medico-psychiatric explanations, that did not enter everyday-life discourse. Instead, these explanations followed a polythetic and polysemic logic that will be analyzed in the third step with a methodologically extended discourse analysis. Finally, genderspecific explanations will be presented. Popular interpretations endowed meaning for the surviving to comprehend the suicide as legitimated means to cope with life and crisis management. The essay is based on 155 unpublished, so called popular autobiographies from Germany (without GDR), Austria and Switzerland. They were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively.

AB This article reports findings from a qualitative study conducted in Switzerland, aimed at understanding how forty-eight survivors made sense of the suicide of a loved one. In-depth interviews were carried out and grounded theory analysis was performed. Suicide shatters the assumptive world of survivors. In their quest for meaning, they undergo three processes. Sense-making is seeking comprehensibility and consists of rebuilding the path which led to suicide and the figure of the person who died. Memory-building encompasses dealing with the legacy of suicide, by preserving reputation and presenting a public storyline intended for people outside the family circle. Meaning-making allows the survivor to journey towards an existential significance of the loss. Four ways of meaning-making were highlighted: for some, suicide becomes the driving force behind a commitment to suicide prevention; for others, it is the source of an increased awareness of life. Other survivors cannot find a constructive personal existential meaning, which prevents the rebuilding of self. Finally, for a minority, suicide is a mishap which needs to be dealt with. Suggestions are made on how social workers can assist survivors in their processes of meaning-making by supporting the elaboration of constructive narratives and offering tailored resources.

ID GERIATRICS; PEOPLE; RISK
AB Switzerland has the second-most-expensive healthcare system worldwide, with 11.5% of gross domestic product spent on health care in 2003. Switzerland has a healthcare system with universal insurance coverage and a social insurance system, ensuring an adequate financial situation for 96% of the 1.1 million older inhabitants.
   Key concerns related to the care of older persons are topics such as increasing healthcare costs, growing public awareness of patient autonomy, and challenges related to assisted suicide. In 2004, the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences issued guidelines for the care of disabled older persons.
   Since 2000, geriatrics has been a board-certified discipline with a 3-year training program in addition to 5 years of training in internal or family medicine. There are approximately 125 certified geriatricians in Switzerland, working primarily in geriatric centers in urban areas. Switzerland has an excellent research environment, ranking second of all countries worldwide in life sciences research-but only 13th in aging research. This is in part due to a lack of specific training programs promoting research on aging and inadequate funding. In addition, there is a shortage of academic geriatricians in Switzerland, in part due to the fact that two of five Swiss universities had no academic geriatric departments in 2005. With more-adequate financial resources for academic geriatrics, Switzerland would have the opportunity to contribute more to aging research internationally and to improved care for older patients.

   RATES
AB Background
   Hanging is a frequent suicide method, but developing measures to prevent suicide by this method is particularly challenging. The aim of this study is to gain new knowledge that would enable the design of effective of measures that would help prevent suicide by hanging.
   Methods
   A total of 6,497 suicides registered across the eight Swiss Forensic Institutes (IRM) were analysed. Of these, 1,282 (19.7%) persons hung themselves. T-test and chi-square tests. and chi-square tests were used to analyse...(or determine, or investigate)...group differences regarding sociodemographic variables and triggers
   Findings
   Men and women who hung themselves showed no significant differences in sociodemographic variables. However, women were significantly more likely to have a psychiatric illness history, whereas men were more likely to have somatic diagnoses. In controlled environments, people used shelves, plumbing and windows more often than beams, pipes, bars and hooks to hang themselves. Compared with other suicide methods, hanging was more likely to have been triggered by partner and financial problems.
   Conclusions
   Suicide by hanging can be best prevented in institutions (e.g. psychiatric hospitals, somatic hospitals, prisons). These institutions should be structurally evaluated and modified with a primary focus on sanitary areas, windows and shelves. Otherwise, it is important to use general suicide prevention measures, such as awareness raising and staff training in medical settings, low-threshold treatment options and regular suicide risk assessment for people at risk.

AB Objectives: There is convergent evidence from adoption, family, geographical, immigrant, molecular genetic, twin and, most recently, surname studies of suicide for genetic contributions to suicide risk. Surnames carry information about genetic relatedness or distance and, in patrilineal surname systems, are a close substitute for Y-chromosome markers and haplotypes, since surname transmission is similar to the transmission of the nonrecombining part of the Y chromosome. This study investigated whether differences in regional suicide rates correspond to the genetic structure of the Austrian population.
   Methods: Differences in district-level standardized suicide rates 1988-94 between the five major surname regions identified for Austria were analyzed. The surname regions used in the analysis reflect the contemporary population structure and closely follow the natural borders found in the topography of Austria, less so its administrative division into nine states.
   Results: Surname region accounted for a significant (P < 0.001) and substantial (38%) portion of the variance in district-level suicide rates. Adjusting the suicide rates for a set of five social and economic indicators that are established ecological correlates of suicide prevalence (income, and rates of the divorced, unemployed, elderly and Roman Catholics) left the results essentially unchanged.
   Conclusions: Regional differences in suicide rates within Austria correspond to the genetic structure of the population. The present evidence adds to related findings from geographical and surname studies of suicide that suggest a role for genetic risk factors for suicidal behavior. Genetic differences between subpopulations may partially account for the geography of suicide. Study limitations and directions for future research are discussed.

   Methods: We conducted a death certificate study on a nationwide continuous random sample of Swiss residents. Using an internationally standardized tool, we sent 4998, 2965, and 1000 anonymous questionnaires to certifying physicians in the German-,French-, and Italian-speaking regions.
   Results: The response rates were 63.5%, 51.9%, and 61.7% in the German-, French-, and Italian-speaking regions, respectively. Non-sudden, expected deaths were preceded by medical end-of-life decisions (MELDs) more frequently in the German- than in the French- or Italian-speaking region (82.3% vs. 75.0% and 74.0%, respectively), mainly due to forgoing life-prolonging treatment (70.0%, 59.8%, 57.4%). Prevalence of assisted suicide was similar in the German- and French-speaking regions (1.6%, 1.2%), with no cases reported in the Italian-speaking region. Patient involvement was smaller in the Italian-than in the French- and German-speaking regions (16.0%, 31.2%, 35.6%). Continuous deep sedation was more frequent in the Italian- than in the French- and German-speaking regions (34.4%, 26.9%, 24.5%), and was combined with MELDs in most cases.
   Conclusion: We found differences in MELD prevalence similar to those found between European countries. On an international level, MELDs are comparably frequent in all regions of Switzerland, in line with the greater role given to patient autonomy. Our findings show how cultural contexts and legislation can interact in shaping the prevalence of MELDs.

AB Due to the aging of the population, an increasing number of people suffer from chronic illnesses and increased fragility, which impair the quality of life. In association with this, increasingly more affected people decide to actively end their life. In addition to methods of suicide carried out by the person alone, assistance by medical personnel is also resorted to. The term assisted suicide implies that the act of committing suicide is done by the persons themselves but physicians can also play an important role. This article elucidates the legal regulations related to assisted suicide and explains the difference to active euthanasia. It explores the existing literature in order to elaborate the different aspects of assisted suicide in today's society. After examining the context of dying in this modern society, it explains various definitions of different types of active euthanasia and assisted suicide and summarizes recent developments in international regulations, with a special focus on the legal context in Switzerland. Finally, it discusses the impact that these developments have on legal medicine, as well as the challenges that need to be addressed in the future and sketches out the role legal medicine should play in this context.

ID RISK-FACTORS; DEPRESSION; IDEATION; DEBATE
AB Background: The internal suicide debate hypothesis assumes that in a suicidal crisis, individuals are involved in an internal struggle over whether to live or die. Reasons for living (RFL) and Reasons for dying (RFD) are important individual reasons for staying alive (e.g. family) or wanting to die (e.g. hopelessness) and reflect this internal motivational conflict of the suicidal mind. The aim of this study was to explore the association between RFL and RFD of suicide attempters and current and future suicide ideation and behavior.
   Method: The sample consisted of 60 patients who were admitted at a psychiatric emergency unit in Switzerland following an attempted suicide. They received treatment as usual, participated in an assessment interview and completed self-report questionnaires. Additionally, they were instructed to write down up to five individual RFL and RFD. The number of RFL and RFD responses, depressive symptoms, and suicide ideation were assessed at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months follow-up. Outcome measures were suicide ideation and repeated suicide attempts. Multiple imputations were used in order to address missing data.
   Results: The number of RFD responses was the strongest predictor for increased suicide ideation at baseline. The number of RFL responses was not associated with suicide ideation and reattempts. RFD, depressive symptoms, and baseline suicide ideation predicted subsequent suicide reattempt up to 12 months later in simple regression analyses. Mediation analyses suggested that RFD mediated the effect of depressive symptoms at baseline on suicide ideation at 12-months follow-up.
   Conclusion: RFL were unrelated to the mental health of study participants and did not function as protective factor against suicide risk. RFD may be an important motivational driver in the suicidal process. Clinical interventions should focus more on the reduction of RFD than on RFL in suicidal individuals.

AB The goal of the study was to determine social and diagnostic characteristics of persons who end their lives by jumping from heights and to compare the characteristics of those who jump from bridges with those jumping from other sites. Data on suicide in Switzerland between 1990 and 2003 were collected from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office and from local authorities. Persons who jumped from heights in general were more likely to suffer from schizophrenia than those who used other methods. Persons who jumped from bridges were younger than those committing suicide by other methods. Compared with those who jumped from other sites, subjects were on average 14.3 years younger and more often male. Individuals who jumped from bridges close to psychiatric hospitals were more likely to suffer from psychiatric illness. Individuals who jump from bridges differ in certain characteristics from those who jump from other sites. For future classification it may be helpful to distinguish suicides from bridges from suicides from other heights. For prevention of suicide from bridges, attention should be paid to characteristics of young persons at risk. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aim: To study the prevalence of psychoactive substance use disorder (PSUD) among suicidal adolescents, psychoactive substance intoxication at the moment of the attempt, and the association between PSUD at baseline and either occurrence of suicide or repetition of suicide attempt(s). Methods: 186 adolescents aged 16 to 21 y hospitalized for suicide attempt or overwhelming suicidal ideation were included (T0); 148 of them were traced again for evaluations after 6 mo (T1) and/or 18 mo (T2). DSM-IV diagnoses were assessed each time using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Results: At T0, 39.2% of the subjects were found to have a PSUD. Among them, a significantly higher proportion was intoxicated at the time of the attempt than those without PSUD (44.3% vs 25.4%). Among the 148 adolescents who could be traced at either T1 or T2, two died from suicide and 30 repeated suicide attempts once or more times. A marginally significant association was found between death by suicide/repetition of suicide attempt and alcohol abuse/dependence at baseline (OR=3.3, 95% CI 0.7-15.0; OR=2.6, 95% CI 0.7-9.3). More than one suicide attempt before admission to hospital at T0 (OR=3.2, 95% CI 1.1-10.0) and age over 19 y at T0 (OR=3.2, 95% CI 1.1-9.2) were independently associated with the likelihood of death by suicide or repetition of suicide attempt.
   Conclusion: Among adolescents hospitalized for suicide attempt or overwhelming suicidal ideation, the risk of death or repetition of attempt is high and is associated with previous suicide attempts-especially among older adolescents-and also marginally associated with PSUD; these adolescents should be carefully evaluated for such risks and followed up once discharged from the hospital.

AB The purpose of this article is to promote a debate about controversial issues there are pertinent to human ageing, but which are not often discussed by the society. Through bibliographic research, documentary and empirical studies, we presented questions related to ageing, death, euthanasia and suicide. It has been noted in this study that some topics are often considered a taboo, such as euthanasia, but there are countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Colombia where this procedure has already been adopted and, in some cases, even regulated. It has been found in this work that death is often not the greatest fear of the human being, but rather the fear of loss of freedom and control of one's life. Family support, clinical treatments and spirituality can be considered to be great allies in trying to prevent suicide by older people.

AB Objective: Numerous authors have reported serious shortcomings in the treatment of suicidal patients. This study examined the treatment suicide attempters admitted to a psychiatric hospital in Switzerland had received prior to the suicide attempt.
   Method: Thirty-one patients were admitted to this hospital within a year, representing 36 suicide attempts, which corresponds to 6.5% of the annual admission number. Three of these patients were admitted twice, and one patient was admitted three times. Information on previous treatment was collected in personal interviews and included medication, and its dosage, at I month and 2 weeks prior to the suicide attempt, and whether the patient had received psychotherapy. In addition, details of the psychosocial event and the means of the suicide attempt were recorded.
   Results: Twenty-one patients had been prescribed psychotropic drugs in 24 events, but only in 17 events concerning 15 patients, antidepressants were prescribed prior to hospitalisation. Antipsychotics and benzodiazepines were prescribed in 6 and 21 events, respectively (including 8 events with hypnotics). None of the patients was treated with lithium. In 19 events, 16 patients had received psychotherapy prior to admission. In 32 events, psychotropic drugs were used for the suicide attempt.
   Conclusion: The findings confirm the undertreatment of patients attempting suicide reported by other authors. In spite of the majority of patients being under psychiatric care, no adequate pharmacotherapy had been prescribed particularly for depressed patients. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Although there are numerous publications on the existing link between month of birth and suicide, only two studies focus on suicide attempts and auto-aggressive behavior. Research data suggest that month of birth is related to a variation of 5-HIAA in the cerebrospinal fluid, which correlates with violent behavior (VB). Therefore, the aim of this study is to search, for the first time, for a possible link between month of birth and the occurrence of VB in emergency, for patients admitted for a suicide attempt with medication. This is a 10 months prospective study among all the patients of the canton of Geneva, Switzerland, admitted in emergency for a suicide attempt with medication. During a 10 months study period we included 493 patients, of which 77 (15.62%) presented VB. Higher incidence of VB was found in subjects where born at the end of winter and the beginning of spring, with a maximum for April and a minimum for December. In spite of a relatively small number of subjects, it seems promising to study the occurrence of VB as a function of month of birth in patients admitted in emergency for a suicide attempt.

AB Adolescence corresponds to a transition period that requires adaptation and change capacities and skills. Most young people succeed with this challenge, whereas a minority fail. In order to identify with the teenage culture, become autonomous, and differentiate from their parents, some adolescents choose to use drugs, beginning with the use of cigarettes, alcohol, cannabis, followed by other illicit drugs such as opiates and stimulants. A high proportion of these adolescents attempt suicide, which is the primary cause of death during adolescence in many European countries. Who are the "vulnerable" adolescents? What are the mechanisms that can explain the varieties of drug-use initiation or suicide attempts? Can "protective factors" be identified? What kind of strategies might be developed at a social and political level in order to prevent or to minimize drug abuse and suicide attempts, among other harmful behaviors? These issues will be discussed on,the basis of the recent literature and in the light of a recent study carried out in the French-speaking part of Switzerland on large cohorts of adolescent drug users. Unresolved critical issues are noted and future needed research is suggested.

TI Familial Aggregation and Coaggregation of Suicide Attempts and Comorbid

AB Key PointsQuestionAre suicide attempts familial, and is familial aggregation explained by comorbid mental disorders? FindingsIn this study of data of 1119 adult probands and 5355 first-degree relatives, suicide attempts were moderately familial and associated with mental disorders, particularly mood disorders. Social anxiety disorder in probands was statistically significantly associated with suicide attempts in relatives. MeaningSuicide attempts appear to be familial, but much of the familial aggregation may be explained by comorbid mental conditions; the increase in suicide attempt risk among people with a familial diathesis for social anxiety or its underlying components may provide insight into the mechanisms and prevention of suicide.
   ImportanceClarification of the joint influence of familial patterns of suicide attempts and comorbid mental disorders can enhance the understanding and prevention of suicide attempts. ObjectiveTo investigate the familial patterns of suicide attempts and comorbid mental disorders and their associations in a 2-site family study of mood and anxiety disorders. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsData were obtained from 2 parallel community-based family studies conducted in the United States (National Institute of Mental Health [NIMH] study) and in Lausanne, Switzerland (PsyCoLaus study), on the comorbidity of mood and anxiety disorders. The study sample comprised 1119 adult probands and 5355 first-degree relatives. Data were collected and analyzed from October 2004 to December 2016. Main Outcomes and MeasuresLifetime suicide attempt and mental disorders in first-degree relatives, obtained through direct interviews or family history reports. ResultsThe study included 1119 adult probands (675 female [60.3%] and a mean [SD] age of 50 [12.0] years) and 5355 first-degree relatives (2752 female [51.4%] and a mean [SD] age of 52 [1.5] years). Of these participants, 90 (8.0%) of 1119 probands and 199 (3.7%) of 5355 relatives had a lifetime history of suicide attempt. Those with such a history had higher rates of all mental disorders, a greater number of disorders, and statistically significantly poorer current and lifetime global functioning. After adjustment for age and sex, a statistically significant association between suicide attempts in probands and in relatives was found at the NIMH site (OR,2.6; 95% CI,1.5-4.7), at the Lausanne site (OR, 3.1; 95% CI,1.6-6.0), and in the combined data (OR,2.9; 95% CI,1.9-4.5). All mood disorder subtypes and substance use disorders were statistically significantly associated with suicide attempts. The familial association between lifetime suicide attempts in probands and relatives was not statistically significant for the combined sample (OR,1.6; 95% CI,1.0-2.7) after adjustment for comorbid conditions in probands and relatives. Social anxiety disorder in probands was associated with suicide attempts in relatives (OR,2.4; 95% CI,1.7-3.5) after controlling for comorbid mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders. Conclusions and RelevanceFamiliality of suicide attempts appears to be explained by a history of mental disorders among those with suicide attempts; the novel finding of a common familial diathesis for suicide attempts and social anxiety, particularly in combination with mood disorders, has heuristic value for future research and may be a risk marker that can inform prevention efforts.
   This study examines participant data from the National Institute of Mental Health family study in the United States and the PsyCoLaus family study in Lausanne, Switzerland, for underlying mental disorders and history of suicidal behavior among adults in the same family.

ID ASSISTED SUICIDE; LIFE; END; EUTHANASIA; CARE; NETHERLANDS; THERAPY
AB In Switzerland, where assisted suicide but not euthanasia is permitted, the authors sought to understand how physicians integrate palliative sedation in their practice and how they reflect on existential suffering and death hastening. They interviewed 31 physicians from different care settings. Five major attitudes emerged. Among specialized palliative care physicians, convinced, cautious and doubtful attitudes were evident. Within unspecialized settings, palliative sedation was more likely to be considered as death hastening: clinicians either avoid it with an inexperienced attitude or practice it with an ambiguous attitude, raising the issue of unskilled and abusive uses of sedatives at the end of life.

AB This study addresses the psychometric properties, including the internal consistency and dimensionality, of the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) in French-speaking mental health and social professionals in Switzerland faced with a patient suicide. Data were obtained by a self-administered questionnaire from a sample of 297 individuals who had experienced a patient suicide during the previous 5 years. The internal consistency of the IES-R and its subscales was high (a coefficients between 0.82 and 0.91) as were the correlations between the subscores (coefficients between 0.54 and 0.69). The dimensionality of the IES-R was best captured by a three-factor structure accounting for 53.0% of the total variance, with four theoretical intrusion items loading on the hyperarousal factor. The intrusion subscale contributed to more than half of the total score. Variations in the total score were associated with age and profession, while no significant association was found with professional experience, length of time since the patient suicide, or number of patient suicides. The French version of the IES-R is an adequate and reliable instrument for addressing the impact of a patient suicide on mental health and social professionals. Its dimensionality is consistent with the theoretical structure of the original version.

AB Objective: To identify the most frequent gender-specific suicide methods in Europe.
   Design: Proportions of seven predominant suicide methods utilised in 16 countries participating in the European Alliance Against Depression (EAAD) were reported in total and cross-nationally. Relative risk (RR) relating to suicide methods and gender was calculated. To group countries by pattern of suicide methods, hierarchical clustering was applied.
   Setting and participants: Data on suicide methods for 119 122 male and 41 338 female cases in 2000-4/ 5 from 16 EAAD countries, covering 52% of European population were obtained.
   Results: Hanging was the most prevalent suicide method among both males (54.3%) and females (35.6%). For males, hanging was followed by firearms (9.7%) and poisoning by drugs (8.6%); for females, by poisoning by drugs (24.7%) and jumping from a high place (14.5%). Only in Switzerland did hanging rank as second for males after firearms. Hanging ranked first among females in eight countries, poisoning by drugs in five and jumping from a high place in three. In all countries, males had a higher risk than females of using firearms and hanging and a lower risk of poisoning by drugs, drowning and jumping. Grouping showed that countries might be divided into five main groups among males; for females, grouping did not yield clear results.
   Conclusions: Research on suicide methods could lead to the development of gender-specific intervention strategies. Nevertheless, other approaches, such as better identification and treatment of mental disorders and the improvement of toxicological aid should be put in place.

AB Objectives: Nowadays, euthanasia has the meaning of the direct administration of a lethal agent to the patient by another party with a merciful intent after patients' request. Physician assisted suicide refers to the patient intentionally and wilfully ending his or her own life with the assistance of a physician. The objectives of the manuscript were to investigate the opinions of Greek physicians, nurses, lay people and relatives of advanced cancer patients on euthanasia and physician assisted suicide.
   Methods: The final sample consisted of 215 physicians, 250 nurses, 218 relatives and 246 lay people. A survey questionnaire was used concerning issues such as euthanasia and physician assisted suicide. The survey instrument included 13 questions and described issues such as religious and spiritual beliefs, euthanasia, physician assisted suicide and decision-making situations.
   Results: 43.3% physicians and 41.3% relatives would agree in advance that in case of heart and/or respiratory arrest there would not be an effort to revive a terminally ill cancer patient. 20.5% physicians had a request for euthanasia. Significant associations were found between physicians (9.3%), relatives (1.8%, p = 0.001) and lay people (3.7%, p = 0.020) on their opinions regarding withdrawing treatment.

AB Suicidal behaviors are not uncommon, but rarely admitted in the families and in society at large. Violence is a public health and social problem of growing concern. Research on the relationship between violence and suicidal behaviors is scarce for the last decades, perhaps because suicide is no longer considered an offense. The present study is based on a sample of 21,314 valid interviews with 20 year old Swiss men, representing over 70 % of this cohort. The questionnaire contained over 900 variables, adressing issues such as previous history of parasuicide, self-reported violent acts and injuries, during childhood and adolescence, as well as over the last year before recruits training. The questionnaire also contains various items about mental health, familial and social conditions and situational factors. We used an ordinal scale for measuring violence and operationalisations of mental disturbances according to theoretical and empirical concepts such as conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder according to DSM IV, the dissocial syndrome according to Rauchfleisch's (1981) definition; 2,6 % of the recruits reported at least one suicide attempt during the last year, one third even multiple attempts. Life-time prevalence at age 20 was 3,9 %. Suicide attempters often showed signs of psychiatric disorders, especially for a dissocial (OR = 6,9) or an antisocial (OR = 5,8) syndrome. Other studies have shown that the rate of suicide in France and Switzerland is very high compared to other European countries. Our study confirms the existence of a real behavioural and existential problem among young Swiss men. Half of the suicide attempters had a history of physical violence against others and 20 % were themselves victims of violent acts during the previous year. Suicide attempters who were victims were also more violent than those who were not victimized. A suicide attempt during the previous year is a marker for violent behaviours (OR = 2,1) and victimisation (OR = 1,9) during this same year. We also found a positive link between multiple attempted suicides and the commission of serious violence. It is concluded that parasuicide among young men is related to other violent acts and should be considered as a positive marker of violent behavior in general and victimisation by crime. It seems that suicide is a transgression of social and cultural values because of the amount of aggression behind it, even if it is not a criminal offense. Suicide attempts of young men should receive more attention by professionals in the field of medicine, psychology and social work. Treatment of these men not only prevents an individual mental health problem but also contributes to crime prevention at the community level. Criminological theories could inspire further studies in suicidology, in order to improve the multidisciplinary knowledge of the phenomenology and etiology of parasuicide. In the same way, criminologists as policy makers should attach more attention to parasuicide given its many theoretical and practical connections with crime.

AB Previous references suggesting a high mortality of propofol addiction in medical personnel were mostly based on surveys of the heads of medical departments or case reports; therefore, a questionnaire was sent to 48 forensic medicine departments in Germany, Austria and Switzerland concerning the number of autopsies carried out between 2002-2112 on medical personnel with the suspicion of abuse of propofol or other analgesics. The response rate was 67%. In 16 out of the 32 responding departments 39 deaths (27 males) were observed with previous connections to anesthesiology, intensive care or emergency departments of which 22 were physicians, 13 nurses, 2 other personnel and 2 were unknown. Propofol was the major cause of death in 33 cases (85%), in 8 cases including 7 with propofol, an unintentional accident was recorded and 29 were determined to be suicide. In 14 cases chronic abuse was denied but actually excluded by toxicological analysis in only 2 cases. In 11 cases involving suicide the question of abuse was not investigated. This survey confirmed previous data about the central role of propofol for the fatal outcome of addiction and suicide of anesthetists and other medical personnel. A dual prevention strategy with low-threshold offers for persons at risk and strategies for early detection is urgently needed including a stricter control of dispensing, improvement in forensic medical documentation and the use of toxicological investigations in every case of suspected abuse.

ID COMPLICATED GRIEF; DIAGNOSTIC-CRITERIA; DEATHS; SUDDEN
AB In Switzerland, all deaths through assisted suicide are reported as unnatural deaths and investigated by a forensic team (police, medical examiner, and state attorney). However, there is limited knowledge concerning the impact these forensic investigations have on the development of post-traumatic stress disorder, complicated grief, or depression in those who have lost a loved one. A cross-sectional survey of 85 family members or close friends who were present at an assisted suicide was conducted in December 2007. The Impact of Event Scale, Inventory of Complicated Grief, and Brief Symptom Inventory were used to assess mental health. The newly developed Forensic Investigation Experience Scale measured the emotional experience of the legal investigation at the death scene. The data suggest that the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder is significantly related to having experienced the forensic investigation as emotionally difficult. Thus, the way the forensic investigation is conducted immediately after an unnatural death is evidently associated with the development of post-traumatic stress. It is recommended that a protocol be developed establishing a standardised response to cases of assisted suicide and that specific training be provided for the legal professionals involved.

AB Background: Care-dependency constitutes an important issue with regard to the approval of end-of-life decisions, yet attitudes towards assisted suicide and euthanasia are understudied among care-dependent older adults. We assessed attitudes towards assisted suicide and euthanasia and tested empirical correlates, including socio-demographics, religiosity, physical illness, psychological distress and social isolation.
   Methods: A nationwide cross-sectional survey among older care allowance recipients (50+) in private households in Austria was conducted in 2016. In computer-assisted personal interviews, 493 respondents were asked whether or not they approved of the availability of assisted suicide and euthanasia in case of long-term care dependency and whether or not they would consider using assisted suicide or euthanasia for themselves. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to assess the impact of potential determinants of attitudes towards assisted suicide and euthanasia.
   Results: About a quarter (24.8-26.0%) of the sampled care-dependent older adults approved of the availability of assisted suicide and euthanasia respectively indicated the will to (hypothetically) make use of assisted suicide or euthanasia. Attitudes towards assisted suicide were most favourable among care-dependent older adults living in urban areas, those who did not trust physicians, those who reported active suicide ideation, and individuals with a strong fear of dying. With regard to euthanasia, living alone, religiosity and fear of dying were the central determinants of acceptance.
   Conclusions: Positive attitudes towards and will to (hypothetically) use assisted suicide and euthanasia were expressed by a substantial minority of care-dependent older adults in Austria and are driven by current psychological suffering and fear of the process of dying in the (near) future. Community-based psychosocial care should be expanded to address psychological distress and fears about end-of-life issues among care-dependent older adults.

ID PSYCHIATRIC-INPATIENTS; TRANSLATION; INSTRUMENTS; AGREEMENT
AB In comparison to the general population, the suicide rates of psychiatric inpatient populations in Germany and Switzerland are very high. An important preventive contribution to the lowering of the suicide rates in mental health care is to ensure that the risk of suicide of psychiatric inpatients is assessed as accurately as possible. While risk-assessment instruments can serve an important function in determining such risk, very few have been translated to German. Therefore, in the present study, we reported on the German version of Nurses' Global Assessment of Suicide Risk (NGASR) scale. After translating the original instrument into German and pretesting the German version, we tested the inter-rater reliability of the instrument. Twelve video case studies were evaluated by 13 raters with the NGASR scale in a 'laboratory' trial. In each case, the observer's agreement was calculated for the single items, the overall scale, the risk levels, and the sum scores. The statistical data analysis was conducted with kappa and AC1 statistics for dichotomous (items, scale) scales. A high-to-very high observers' agreement (AC1: 0.62-1.00, kappa: 0.00-1.00) was determined for 16 items of the German version of the NGASR scale. We conclude that the German version of the NGASR scale is a reliable instrument for evaluating risk factors for suicide. A reliable application in the clinical practise appears to be enhanced by training in the use of the instrument and the right implementation instructions.

ID ASPHYXIAL SUICIDE; PLASTIC BAG; INHALATION
AB Background In Switzerland, right-to-die organisations assist their members with suicide by lethal drugs, usually barbiturates. One organisation, Dignitas, has experimented with oxygen deprivation as an alternative to sodium pentobarbital.
   Objective To analyse the process of assisted suicide by oxygen deprivation with helium and a common face mask and reservoir bag.
   Method This study examined four cases of assisted suicide by oxygen deprivation using helium delivered via a face mask. Videos of the deaths were provided by the Zurich police. Dignitas provided protocol and consent information.
   Results One man and three women were assisted to death by oxygen deprivation. There was wide variation in the time to unconsciousness and the time to death, probably due to the poor mask fit. Swiss law prevented attendants from effectively managing the face mask apparatus. Purposeless movements of the extremities were disconcerting for Dignitas attendants, who are accustomed to assisting suicide with barbiturates. None of the dying individuals attempted self-rescue.
   Conclusions The dying process of oxygen deprivation with helium is potentially quick and appears painless. It also bypasses the prescribing role of physicians, effectively demedicalising assisted suicide. Oxygen deprivation with a face mask is not acceptable because leaks are difficult to control and it may not eliminate rebreathing. These factors will extend time to unconsciousness and time to death. A hood method could reduce the problem of mask fit. With a hood, a flow rate of helium sufficient to provide continuous washout of expired gases would remedy problems observed with the mask.

AB In January 2006 the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV), a large university hospital in Lausanne, Switzerland, became the first hospital in Switzerland to allow assisted suicide (AS) in exceptional cases within its walls. However, euthanasia is illegal. This decision has posed several ethical and practical dilemmas for the hospital's palliative care consult service. To address these, the team embarked on a formal process of open dialogue amongst its members with the goal of identifying a collective response and position. This process involved meetings every 4 to 6 weeks over the course of 10 months. An iterative process unfolded. One of the principal dilemmas relates to finding a balance between the team's position against AS and the patient's autonomy and the institution's directive. Although all team members expressed opposition to AS, there were mixed opinions as to whether or not the team members should be present during the act if requested so by patients. Some thought this could be misinterpreted as complicity in the act and could send out mixed messages to the public and other health professionals about palliative care. Others felt that the team's commitment to nonabandonment obliged them to be present even if they did not provide the drug or give any advice or assistance. The implications of nonabandonment are explored, as are several other questions such as whether or not the teams are obliged to provide detailed information on AS when requested by patients.

ID TRAUMA; SYMPTOMS; DISORDER; SCALE
AB Background: In Switzerland, right-to-die organizations such as Exit Deutsche Schweiz offer suicide assistance to their members. However, there is limited knowledge of the impact that witnessing assisted suicide has on the post-traumatic stress severity or the grief process of family members. Low perceived social acknowledgement may affect mental health.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 85 family members who were present at an assisted suicide was conducted in December 2007. The Inventory of Complicated Grief and the Impact of Event Scale were used to assess symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complicated grief (CG) at 14 to 24 months post-loss. Further, the Social Acknowledgement Questionnaire was used to examine the impact that the social environment's acknowledgement of the end-of-life decision had on respondents' mental health.
   Results: As expected, social acknowledgement as a survivor was related to PTSD symptoms and CG. In particular, perceived general disapproval was strongly correlated with all outcome measures, whereas recognition was not significantly related to PTSD or CG (intrusion and avoidance).
   Conclusion: Family members of patients who use assisted suicide may hesitate to disclose the manner of death, and the community and societal environment may express strong views concerning the end-of-life decision. This can lead to increased levels of PTSD and CG.

AB QUESTIONS UNDER STUDY: Suicidal behaviour is a major source of burden of disease. While most studies focus on cost associated with completed suicides, data on costs of, non-lethal, suicide attempts are lacking. The aim of this study was to assess direct annual cost of suicide attempts in Basel in 2003 from a health services perspective.
   METHODS: Retrospective cost-of-illness-study of the Basel cohort of the 2003 WHO/EURO-Multicentre Study on Parasuicide. We extracted cost information from the two major hospitals involved in treatment of these patients. We determined overall cost, compared cost medians and identified variables associated with higher cost by means of logistic regression.
   RESULTS: For 2003, treatment of suicide attempters in Basel's main hospitals amounted to 3,373,025 Swiss Francs (CHF), mainly attributable to psychiatric care. Mean and median cost per case were 19,165 CHF and 6,108 CHF, respectively. Based on these findings, the extrapolated direct medical costs for medical treatment of suicide attempts in Switzerland per year amount to 191 million CHF. Parameters associated with high costs were age above 65 (p < 0.01), using a hard method (p < 0.05), receiving intensive care (p <.05), and lethal intention (p < 0.05). The ICD-10 diagnostic category F3 was associated with significantly higher costs than F1 (p < 0.05) and F4 (p < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Attempted suicide produces substantial direct medical costs, which are only a part of the financial burden. Prevention targeting mood disorders, the elderly and the use of hard methods may be most cost-effective. Further research should aim at identifying additional indirect costs and the cost-effectiveness of prevention measures.

TI Drug suicide: a sex-equal cause of death in 16 European countries

   TRENDS; ANTIDEPRESSANTS; AVAILABILITY; RESTRICTIONS
AB Background: There is a lack of international research on suicide by drug overdose as a preventable suicide method. Sex-and age-specific rates of suicide by drug self-poisoning (ICD-10, X60-64) and the distribution of drug types used in 16 European countries were studied, and compared with other self-poisoning methods (X65-69) and intentional self-injury (X70-84).
   Methods: Data for 2000-04/05 were collected from national statistical offices. Age-adjusted suicide rates, and age and sex distributions, were calculated.
   Results: No pronounced sex differences in drug self-poisoning rates were found, either in the aggregate data (males 1.6 and females 1.5 per 100,000) or within individual countries. Among the 16 countries, the range (from some 0.3 in Portugal to 5.0 in Finland) was wide. 'Other and unspecified drugs' (X64) were recorded most frequently, with a range of 0.2-1.9, and accounted for more than 70% of deaths by drug overdose in France, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain. Psychotropic drugs (X61) ranked second. The X63 category ('other drugs acting on the autonomic nervous system') was least frequently used. Finland showed low X64 and high X61 figures, Scotland had high levels of X62 ('narcotics and hallucinogens, not elsewhere classified') for both sexes, while England exceeded other countries in category X60. Risk was highest among the middle-aged everywhere except in Switzerland, where the elderly were most at risk.
   Conclusions: Suicide by drug overdose is preventable. Intentional self-poisoning with drugs kills as many males as females. The considerable differences in patterns of self-poisoning found in the various European countries are relevant to national efforts to improve diagnostics of suicide and appropriate specific prevention. The fact that vast majority of drug-overdose suicides came under the category X64 refers to the need of more detailed ICD coding system for overdose suicides is needed to permit better design of suicide-prevention strategies at national level.

AB Assisted suicide (AS) is a controversial practice with which physicians and nurses are confronted more and more often. In Switzerland, it is available for Swiss residents and in certain cases for foreigners. Prisoners meet the same prerequisites for AS as the general population and should therefore be eligible for it. Ethical issues, such as informed choice and the autonomy of prisoners, and organizational questions need to be addressed. They must not lead to a denial of this practice. Even though prisons constitute a special area of work for medical staff, it is important to address the possibility of AS in prison openly. This can raise awareness of the difficulties health-care professionals face working in closed institutions.

AB This article addresses ethical issues in the conduct of ethnographic research with vulnerable study participants, such as individuals with cognitive impairment. Seven ethical issues emerged from this case study, in which a participant diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease wished to pursue euthanasia in Switzerland: (a) How to protect the participant's autonomy while ensuring his decision had not resulted from untreated depression or modifiable social factors; (b) How to interpret self-harm; (c) How to protect the research team members' "mandated reporter" status; (d) How to counteract the attractive qualities of pro-euthanasia videos depicting an easy end to personal suffering; (e) How to find a better alternative to the common practice of reporting self-harm cases to Adult Protective Services and then removing these cases from studies; (f) How to leverage a participant's trust to address these issues; and (g) Whether researchers should do anything further to help address unmet needs in similar situations.

AB Objective: The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and complaints among remand prisoners in Switzerland and to analyze the relationships between psychiatric symptoms, physical health and substance abuse problems in this population.
   Method: The medical files of all detainees attending the prison health service in 2007 were reviewed. Identified health problems were coded using the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC-2). Descriptive statistics and measures of association were computed.
   Results: A total of 1510 files were analyzed. Several associations between psychological symptoms (anxiety and insomnia) and physical health problems (skin, respiratory and circulatory) were observed. Substance abuse was also frequently associated with somatic health problems.
   Conclusions: These data provide the first comprehensive description of the mental health of detainees in Switzerland's largest remand prison. Our findings emphasize the need for coordinated health care services in detention settings. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Previous literature has suggested that laws and regulations may impact the use of palliative sedation. Our present study compares the attitudes of French-speaking physicians practicing in the Quebec and Swiss environments, where different laws are in place regarding physician-assisted suicide.
   Method: Data were drawn from two prior studies, one by Blondeau and colleagues and another by Beauverd and coworkers, employing the same two-by-two experimental design with length of prognosis and type of suffering as independent variables. Both the effect of these variables and the effect of their interaction on Swiss and Quebec physicians' attitudes toward sedation were compared. The written comments of respondents were submitted to a qualitative content analysis and summarized in a comparative perspective.
   Results: The analysis of variance showed that only the type of suffering had an effect on physicians' attitudes toward sedation. The results of the Wilcoxon test indicated that the attitudes of physicians from Quebec and Switzerland tended to be different for two vignettes: long-term prognosis with existential suffering (p = 0.0577) and short-term prognosis with physical suffering (p = 0.0914). In both cases, the Swiss physicians were less prone to palliative sedation.
   Significance of results: The attitudes of physicians from Quebec and Switzerland toward palliative sedation, particularly regarding prognosis and type of suffering, seem similar. However, the results suggest that physicians from Quebec could be slightly more open to palliative sedation, even though most were not in favor of this practice as an answer to end-of-life existential suffering.

TI A role for doctors in assisted dying?: An analysis of legal regulations
   and medical professional positions in six European countries
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
ID PALLIATIVE CARE; SUICIDE; EUTHANASIA; NETHERLANDS; ATTITUDES
AB Objectives: To analyse legislation and medical professional positions concerning the doctor's role in assisted dying in western Europe, and to discuss their implications for doctors.
   Method: This paper is based on country-specific reports by experts from European countries where assisted dying is legalised (Belgium, The Netherlands), or openly practiced (Switzerland), or where it is illegal (Germany, Norway, UK).
   Results: Laws on assisted dying in The Netherlands and Belgium are restricted to doctors. In principle, assisted suicide (but not euthanasia) is not illegal in either Germany or Switzerland, but a doctor's participation in Germany would violate the code of professional medical conduct and might contravene of a doctor's legal duty to save life. The Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill proposed in the UK in 2005 focused on doctors, whereas the Proposal on Assisted Dying of the Norwegian Penal Code Commission minority in 2002 did not.
   Professional medical organisations in all these countries except The Netherlands maintain the position that medical assistance in dying conflicts with the basic role of doctors. However, in Belgium and Switzerland, and for a time in the UK, these organisations dropped their opposition to new legislation. Today, they regard the issue as primarily a matter for society and politics. This "neutral'' stance differs from the official position of the Royal Dutch Medical Association which has played a key role in developing the Dutch practice of euthanasia as a "medical end-of-life decision'' since the 1970s.
   Conclusion: A society moving towards an open approach to assisted dying should carefully identify tasks to assign exclusively to medical doctors, and distinguish those possibly better performed by other professions.

   disorder; Depression
ID INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; IMPACT; EUTHANASIA; SYMPTOMS; FAMILY; SCALE; DIE
AB Background: Despite continuing political, legal and moral debate on the subject, assisted suicide is permitted in only a few countries worldwide. However, few studies have examined the impact that witnessing assisted suicide has on the mental health of family members or close friends.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 85 family members or close friends who were present at an assisted suicide was conducted in December 2007. Full or partial Post-Traumatic Distress Disorder (PTSD; Impact of Event Scale-Revised), depression and anxiety symptoms (Brief Symptom Inventory) and complicated grief (Inventory of Complicated Grief) were assessed at 14 to 24 months post-loss.
   Results: Of the 85 participants, 13% met the criteria for full PTSD (cut-off >= 35), 6.5% met the criteria for subthreshold PTSD (cut-off >= 25), and 4.9% met the criteria for complicated grief. The prevalence of depression was 16%; the prevalence of anxiety was 6%.
   Conclusion: A higher prevalence of PTSD and depression was found in the present sample than has been reported for the Swiss population in general. However, the prevalence of complicated grief in the sample was comparable to that reported for the general Swiss population. Therefore, although there seemed to be no complications in the grief process, about 20% of respondents experienced full or subthreshold PTSD related to the loss of a close person through assisted suicide.

AB Gay men are at higher risk of suicidality. This paper describes the causes of suicide attempts as perceived by the men themselves and analyzes their impact on severity and recidivism. Mental health surveys conducted among gay men in Geneva, Switzerland, from two probability-based time-space samples in 2007 and 2011, were merged to yield a combined sample N = 762. Suicide ideation, plans, and attempts were assessed, and respondents who had ever attempted suicide answered open questions about perceived causes which were coded and categorized for analysis within the framework of cultural epidemiology. In all, 16.7% of the respondents reported a suicide attempt in their lifetime (59.5% of them with multiple attempts). At their latest attempt, over two thirds asserted intent to die, and half required medical assistance. There was a wide variety of perceived causes, with most individuals reporting multiple causes and many of the most common causes cited at both the first and most recent subsequent attempts. Social/ inter-personal problems constitute the most prominent category. Problems with love/relationship and accepting one's homosexuality figure consistently among the top three causes. Whereas the former tend to be associated with weaker intent to die, the latter are associated with the strongest intent to die and reported at multiple attempts. Problems with family are among the most common perceived causes at first attempt but not at the most recent subsequent attempt. Nevertheless, they tend to be related to the strongest intent to die and the greatest medical severity of all the perceived causes. Ten percent of men attempting suicide cited depression as a cause. Although it tended to be associated with weaker intent to die, depression was most likely to be reported at multiple attempts. Respondent-driven assessment yielded both common and idiosyncratic causes of suicide and their distinct effects. Some of these perceived causes are not prominent in the current literature, yet they have important implications for understanding risk and preventing suicide among gay men.

AB The aim of this study was to compare patterns of contact made by patients with GPs and other healthcare professionals in two European cities prior to attempting suicide. The objective was to determine whether differences between a public and a private healthcare system could be a possible factor influencing the help-seeking behaviour of suicide attempters. Within the frame of the WHO/EURO Multicentre Study on Parasuicide, structured interviews were conducted with suicide attempters in Pecs, Hungary (n = 101) and Bern, Switzerland (n = 66). In Bern, slightly more patients visited their GPs throughout the year. However, within the last week before the suicide attempt, twice as many Hungarian patients went to see a GP compared with the Bern sample. Almost the same proportion of the patients had suicidal ideation, but in Pecs more than a quarter of them and in Bern half of them talked about their suicidal thoughts. in the Hungarian sample, more patients were prescribed medication and almost half of them used these drugs for self-poisoning compared to over a quarter in Bern. The differences in help-seeking behaviour between the two samples may be related to the higher number of practising GPs and a more consistent patient-doctor relationship in Bern. it is likely that a consistent and personal relationship with a medical helper or system (e.g. GP as gatekeeper) facilitates the communication Of suicidal ideation.

TI Suicide: Managing self-directed violence?
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have put forth recommendations to document events in terms of well-defined categories of self-directed violence even though the evolution of terminology for decriminalization and de-stigmatization from "self-murder" to "suicide" to "self-directed violence" may be just avoiding calling a spade a spade. Suicide causes mortality (and morbidity if suicide attempt) in an individual leading to (a) physical suffering to others by injuring them during-and-after the act, (b) psychological toll on the next-of-kin, and (c) isolation of society due to its suicide-statistics and economic losses with overall loss of spirit to pursue happiness potentially resulting more mortality if morbidity becomes too severe for the affected. What is the story (myth) instigating an individual to commit (or think of committing) the act of self-directed violence? And what is the story (myth) in the society that is allowing the act in some instances while prohibiting and sometimes even punishing the act in other instances? We believe that Switzerland can provide an apt example to understand suicide. Swiss ideology may inspire societies around the world to recognize their stories (myths) when they scientifically decipher prevalence of self-directed violence "suicide" even in nonhuman animals. Consequently, astounding statistics of physician suicide call for action from physicians' community to understand peers when none can remain untouched by harsh reality of unique stress which physicians' workspace entails. One of the possible remedies may be thoughtlessness (a form of meditation) which may require strenuous practicing; however, the first step towards achieving it may possibly involve mindfulness (another form of meditation) inspiring peers to learn the need to refocus onto whatever good there is over whatever better there could have been. Essentially, the conception of birth and the birth itself is always planned to be joyful; and the embrace of death itself and the life after death is always purported to be peaceful.

ID INPATIENT TREATMENT; SUICIDE
AB Introduction: Psychiatric Special Observation (PSO) is an intervention often used by nurses to prevent service users of harming themselves or to protect others. The intervention ranges between control and therapy and is resource intensive. Despite the widespread use of PSO, there is still no data on the practice of the intervention in Switzerland.Aim: What is the current practice of PSO in adults in psychiatric hospitals in the German-speaking part of Switzerland? Method: Descriptive cross-sectional study. Nurses from inpatient psychiatric services in the German-speaking part of Switzerland completed a questionnaire based on a concept analysis of PSO. Results: 538 questionnaires were analysed. PSO was more often conducted intermittent than as constant observation. In more than one out of four cases, suicidality reasoned as a cause for prescription. Nurses generally used standardized instruments to assess the risk of harming oneself or others. The duration of PSO lasted eight hours or more in three out of four cases. In every fifth case, there was no validation of the need of the intervention taking place during one shift. Nurses have a neutral attitude towards the intervention and are experiencing no or weak negative feelings during performance of PSO. Conclusions: The results suggest that there is an inconsistent performance of PSO in Switzerland as well as in other countries. The validation of the need of the intervention is insufficient. To facilitate PSO as a justified performance, the preparation of an interprofessional guideline is recommended.

AB IMPORTANCE The increasing legalization of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide worldwide makes it important to understand related attitudes and practices.
   OBJECTIVE To review the legal status of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide and the available data on attitudes and practices.
   EVIDENCE REVIEW Polling data and published surveys of the public and physicians, official state and country databases, interview studies with physicians, and death certificate studies (the Netherlands and Belgium) were reviewed for the period 1947 to 2016. FINDINGS Currently, euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide can be legally practiced in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Colombia, and Canada (Quebec since 2014, nationally as of June 2016). Physician-assisted suicide, excluding euthanasia, is legal in 5 US states (Oregon, Washington, Montana, Vermont, and California) and Switzerland. Public support for euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in the United States has plateaued since the 1990s (range, 47%-69%). In Western Europe, an increasing and strong public support for euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide has been reported; in Central and Eastern Europe, support is decreasing. In the United States, less than 20% of physicians report having received requests for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide, and 5% or less have complied. In Oregon and Washington state, less than 1% of licensed physicians write prescriptions for physician-assisted suicide per year. In the Netherlands and Belgium, about half or more of physicians reported ever having received a request; 60% of Dutch physicians have ever granted such requests. Between 0.3% to 4.6% of all deaths are reported as euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide in jurisdictions where they are legal. The frequency of these deaths increased after legalization. More than 70% of cases involved patients with cancer. Typical patients are older, white, and well-educated. Pain is mostly not reported as the primary motivation. A large portion of patients receiving physician-assisted suicide in Oregon and Washington reported being enrolled in hospice or palliative care, as did patients in Belgium. In no jurisdiction was there evidence that vulnerable patients have been receiving euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide at rates higher than those in the general population.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are increasingly being legalized, remain relatively rare, and primarily involve patients with cancer. Existing data do not indicate widespread abuse of these practices.

TI Suicide and Ambient Temperature: A Multi-Country Multi-City Study

DT Article
ID SOUTH-AFRICA; MORTALITY; SEASONALITY; RATES; ASSOCIATION; ENGLAND
AB BACKGROUND: Previous literature suggests that higher ambient temperature may play a role in increasing the risk of suicide. However, no multicountry study has explored the shape of the association and the role of moderate and extreme heat across different locations.
   OBJECTIVES: We examined the short-term temperature suicide relationship using daily time-series data collected for 341 locations in 12 countries for periods ranging from 4 to 40 y.
   METHODS: We conducted a two-stage meta-analysis. First, we performed location-specific time-stratified case-crossover analyses to examine the temperature suicide association for each location. Then, we used a multivariate meta-regression to combine the location-specific lag-cumulative nonlinear associations across all locations and by country.
   RESULTS: A total of 1,320,148 suicides were included in this study. Higher ambient temperature was associated with an increased risk of suicide in general, and we observed a nonlinear association (inverted J-shaped curve) with the highest risk at 27 degrees C. The relative risk (RR) for the highest risk was 1.33 (95% CI: 1.30, 1.36) compared with the risk at the first percentile. Country-specific results showed that the nonlinear associations were more obvious in northeast Asia (Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan). The temperature with the highest risk of suicide ranged from the 87th to 88th percentiles in the northeast Asian countries, whereas this value was the 99th percentile in Western countries (Canada, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, and the United Slates) and South Africa, where nearly linear associations were estimated. The country-specific RRs ranged from 1.31 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.44) in the United States to 1.65 (95% CI: 1.40, 1.93) in Taiwan, excluding countries where the results were substantially uncertain.
   DISCUSSION: Our findings showed that the risk of suicide increased with increasing ambient temperature in many countries, but to varying extents and not necessarily linearly. This temperature suicide association should be interpreted cautiously, and further evidence of the relationship and modifying factors is needed.

AB The aim of this study was the validation of a brief form of the Perceived Neighborhood Social Cohesion questionnaire using data from 5065 men from the Cohort Study on Substance-Use Risk Factors. A 9-item scale covering three factors was proposed. Excellent indices of internal consistency were measured (=.93). The confirmatory factor analyses resulted in acceptable fit indices supporting measurement invariance across French and German forms. Significant correlations were found between the brief form of the Perceived Neighborhood Social Cohesion questionnaire, and satisfaction and self-reported health, providing evidence of the concurrent validity of the scale. Perceived neighborhood social cohesion, and depression and suicide attempts were negatively associated, sustaining the protective effect of perceived social cohesion.

AB Objective: Some evidence suggests that suicidal behaviour of Turkish migrants differs from the native population's suicidal behaviour. In most studies on this topic, however, analyses have not been based on representative populations; moreover, they partly suffer from methodical shortcomings. We have therefore analysed the suicidal behaviour of Turkish migrants in comparison to that of native Swiss citizens of Basel, Switzerland, using sound methodology; Materials and methods: In 2003 and 2004 in the framework of the WHO/EURO-Multicentre study we investigated all inhabitants of the canton Basel City over 15 years of age who got medical help subsequent to an attempt of suicide. Data of Swiss and Turkish patients were compared. Results: The suicide attempt rate among Turkish migrants was on average more than 2.7 times higher in all age groups than in Swiss citizens. The rate of women was twice as high as that of men. Young females showed the highest rates. Migrants suffered more often from disorders of the ICD-10-category F4 and more often used medication overdoses. Conclusions: Preventative efforts should concentrate especially on young Turkish females and migrants suffering from stress-related disorders. Clinical relevance: When prescribing medication, especially analgesics, lowest toxicity and smallest packaged quantity should be aimed at.

AB Two right-to-die organisations offer assisted suicide in Switzerland. The specific legal situation allows assistance to Swiss and foreign citizens. Both organisations require a report of the person's health status before considering assistance. This qualitative study explored these reports filed to legal authorities after the deaths of individuals in the area of Zurich. Health status reports in the legal medical dossiers of the deceased were analysed using content analysis and Grounded Theory. From 421 cases of assisted suicide (2001-2004), 350 reports on health status were filed. Many cases contained diagnosis lists only. Other reports had more elaborate reports revealing that some physicians were aware about the patient's death wish and the intention to solicit assisted suicide. Physicians' attitudes ranged from neutral to rather depreciative. Few physicians openly referred the patient to the organisations and supported the patient's request by highlighting a history of suffering as well as reporting understanding and agreement with the patient's wish to hasten death. In the health status reports five categories could be identified. Some files revealed that physicians were aware of the death wish. The knowledge and recognition of the patient's death wish varied from no apparent awareness to strongly supportive. This variety might be due to difficulties to discuss the death wish with patients, but might also reflect the challenge to avoid legal prosecution in the country of origin. To require comparable health status reports as requirements for the right-to-die organisations might be difficult to pursue.

DE assisted suicide; coping stages; presuicidal development; accompanying
AB Three patients are presented in their development during the planning of an assisted suicide. The underlying illnesses were: a progressive motor neuron disease starting in infancy, progressive multiple sclerosis, and locked-in syndrome after on ischemic-hemorrhagic brainstem stroke. The latter, unable to perform a forceful enough hand-movement to switch the PEG-pump died from pneumonia. The other two committed suicide in Switzerland. Numerous conversations with the patients and their relatives gave insight to the reasons and motifs. Seven stages of coping can be distinguished: hoping for therapy, losing certainty depression, setting plans in motion, spiritual re-orientation, letting-go, and for the relatives: working through the aftermath. The distinction of the stages will be qualified by variability of duration, overlap, anticipation and flashback, as well as interpersonal variations between all concerned. For a better understanding one has to keep in mind that appealing for help and taking stock exist complementarily, and that ambiguous tendencies exist in both the patient and in his/her environment. Formally the development towards on assisted suicide is marked by a threshold of anticipated increasing deterioration, as well as the dichotomy between a prognosis of an almost undiminished life-expectancy and an increasing loss of independence. This leads to the perception of an increasing rift between the desire to survive, and decreasing self-respect, autonomy and dignity. This rift demonstrates the complementary nature of freedom and dependancy involved in making this decision. If those accompanying manage to realise a careful personal encounter the one leaving con be granted comfort, consolation and a growth in understanding and development.

AB The issue of rational suicide of a competent patient suffering from a hopeless but not terminal disease is controversial. Little is known about how psychiatrists, other physicians or judges make decisions about involuntary hospitalization of such patients, or about their ethical reasoning. The objective of this study was to identify future physicians' and lawyers' views on involuntary hospitalization of a suicidal Huntington's disease (HD) patient and to evaluate whether they are ethically defendable. Five-hundred and ninety-nine law students and advanced medical students reported whether they agree or not to involuntary hospitalize a suicidal HD patient (audio/video recording). No significant differences were found between medical and law students. Forty-four percent of students agreed to hospitalization, 49.3% disagreed. The comments indicate that medical and law students had pessimistic views about the quality of life of an HD patient. Medical students referred more often than law students to patients' autonomy rights and less often to benefits to relatives. Involuntary hospitalization of a suicidal but not terminal HD patient is controversial among future physicians and lawyers. Students underestimated the need for careful evaluation. More open discussion and more ethical teaching on the subject of acceptance of rational suicide for hopelessly, but not yet terminally ill patients are needed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may be associated with the wish to hasten death (WTHD). We aimed to determine the prevalence and stability of WTHD and end-of-life attitudes in ALS patients, identify predictive factors, and explore communication about WTHD. We conducted a prospective questionnaire study among patients and their primary caregivers attending ALS clinics in Germany and Switzerland. We enrolled 66 patients and 62 caregivers. Half of the patients could imagine asking for assisted suicide or euthanasia; 14% expressed a current WTHD at the baseline survey. While 75% were in favour of non-invasive ventilation, only 55% and 27% were in favour of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and invasive ventilation, respectively. These attitudes were stable over 13 months. The WTHD was predicted by depression, anxiety, loneliness, perceiving to be a burden to others, and a low quality of life (all p < 0.05). Lower religiosity predicted whether patients could imagine assisted suicide or euthanasia. Two-thirds of patients had communicated their WTHD to relatives; no-one talked to the physician about it, yet half of them would like to do so. In conclusion, physicians should consider proactively asking for WTHD, and be sensitive towards neglected psychosocial problems and psychiatric comorbidity.

AB Background and methods: the Swiss "Right-toDie"-society EXIT enables assisted suicide by providing terminally ill members with a lethal dosage of barbiturates on request. This practice is tolerated by Swiss legislation. EXIT insists on its assumption that people with serious illness and suffering have the competency to take such a decision. The case of two patients who committed suicide a short time after their release from a psychiatric clinic raised some doubts about the practice of EXIT. The files of all 43 cases of suicide assisted by EXIT between 1992 and 1997 in the region of Basle kept in the Institute of Forensic Medicine were examined for accuracy of the medical data. This sample was compared for age, gender-ratio and prior psychiatric treatment with 425 ordinary suicides in the same region. An attempt was made to assess whether only terminally ill and people with intolerable suffering had been assisted with suicide and what efforts EXIT had made to rule out psychiatric illnesses or poor social conditions as the reason for the wish to die.
   Results: a medical report of the treating doctor(s) was in the files in only five cases. The "EXIT" cases where older than the "ordinary"-sample. Among those over 65 years old there were almost mice as many women as men. 16 of the 24 women older than 65 years were widowed. There were 20 cases of cancer; but in eleven cases medical files revealed no apparent medical condition to explain a death-wish. Five of the patients declared a social loss or fear of such loss as the reason for their wish to die. Six persons had formerly been in psychiatric care, though this was not mentioned in the files.
   Conclusions: due to the scarcity of information in the files as regards previous palliative care, the high proportion of old women and the high percentage of people not suffering from a terminal illness compared to the literature we conclude that psychiatric or social factors are not an obstacle for EXIT to assist with suicide.

TI Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide: what about in Europe?

DT Review
DE Euthanasia; Assisted suicide; Legal liability; Europe
ID OF-LIFE PRACTICES; CHILDREN; TRENDS
AB INTRODUCTION: End-of-life legislation, because of its bioethical, medico-legal, and judicial implications, is heatedly disputed in Europe and throughout the world, engendering a variety of legal end-of-life care options in different countries. We thought it could be interesting to compare the Italian law with current European legislation regulating end-of-life matters.
   EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic search of the Medline, Cochrane Central, Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct databases was conducted using the search words: "euthanasia", "law", "Europe", and "assisted suicide". The search word "euthanasia" was entered singly or in combination with each of the other search terms.
   EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: To date, only three countries in Europe (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) have legalized euthanasia, and four countries (Switzerland, France, Austria, Germany) permit only assisted suicide. Acceptance by the general public of euthanasia and assisted suicide increased in 11 of 13 European countries between 1981 and 2008, in parallel with a decrease in religiosity (except for Italy and Holland) and an increase in secularization. There was also a trend toward a correlation between an increase of the value of self-determination in important life issues and an increase in acceptance of euthanasia.
   CONCLUSIONS: This review shows that end-of-life decisions constitute a challenge for political governance and bioethical deliberation in modern liberal democracies. It appears that in certain situations, euthanasia is perceived more as a means to reduce health care costs rather than an ethical question regarding self-determination.

AB Background: Patient suicide is a professional hazard for mental health professionals and an event likely to trigger stress reactions among them.
   This study aimed to identify typical profiles of professionals after a patient suicide to address the severity of stress reactions and its discriminant variables.
   Methods: Mental health professionals (N = 666) working in institutional settings or private practice in the French-speaking part of Switzerland filled out a self-administered questionnaire including the IES-R (Impact of Event Scale-Revised). Profiles were identified by cluster analysis.
   Results: The interplay of variables pertaining to the relationship to the patient, exposure to suicide, support and training contributed to explaining the severity of stress reactions after a patient suicide. Five profiles of professionals were identified. Low-impacted professionals (55.8 % of the sample) were characterised either by high support and anticipation (anticipators with support), emotional distance to the patient (distant professionals) or no contact with the patient at the time of death (no more contact with patient professionals). Emotional closeness to, and responsibility for the patient were typical of moderately-impacted professionals (36.6 %, concerned professionals), while highly-impacted professionals felt emotionally close to the patient and lacked support although more than half of them sought it (7.7 %, unsupported professionals).
   Conclusions: Differences in the professionals' profiles relate prominently to the interplay between risk and protective factors. Professionals who were appropriately supported, i.e., according to their risk profile, were able to cope with the event. Taking into account the profiles of professionals and the severity of stress reactions may enable the screening of those professionals most in need of support. Those most impacted sought out help more frequently. However, only a minority of them were offered sufficient support. Institutional or vocational bodies should take measures to ensure that professionals seeking help find it easily and promptly.
   The combination of training and support seems to be crucial for mitigating risk factors since the three low impacted subgroups had received the most training and support.

AB Background: Every year, more than 800,000 people worldwide die by suicide. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the effectiveness of brief psychological interventions in addressing suicidal thoughts and behaviour in healthcare settings.
   Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, systematic searches were conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and PsycINFO databases. A predefined search strategy was used. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts followed by full texts against predefined inclusion criteria. Backward and forward citation tracking of included papers was conducted. Quality appraisal was conducted using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for Randomized Controlled Trials and the CASP tool for randomised controlled trials. The small number and heterogeneity of studies did not allow for meta-analysis to be conducted. A narrative synthesis was conducted.
   Results: Four controlled studies of brief psychological interventions were included, conducted in Switzerland, the U.S. and across low and middle-income countries. Three studies were conducted with adults and one with adolescents. All studies were judged to be at low risk of bias. All of the interventions were implemented with patients after attending emergency departments and involved 3412 participants. The main outcomes were suicide, suicide attempts, suicidal ideation, depression and hospitalization. The components of the interventions were early therapeutic engagement, information provision, safety planning and follow-up contact for at least 12 months. The interventions drew to, different degrees, on psychological theory and techniques. Two trials that measured suicidal ideation found no impact. Two studies showed fewer suicide attempts, one showed fewer suicides and one found an effect on depression.
   Conclusions: Although the evidence base is small, brief psychological interventions appear to be effective in reducing suicide and suicide attempts. All studies to date have been conducted with people who had attended the ED but the interventions could potentially be adopted for inpatient and other outpatient settings. Early engagement and therapeutic intervention based on psychological theories of suicidal behaviour, sustained in follow-up contacts, may be particularly beneficial.

AB Some form of assisted dying (voluntary euthanasia and/or assisted suicide) is lawful in the Netherlands, Belgium, Oregon, and Switzerland. In order to be lawful in these jurisdictions, a valid request must precede the provision of assistance to die. Non-adherence to the criteria for valid requests for assisted dying may be a trigger for civil and/or criminal liability, as well as disciplinary sanctions where the assistor is a medical professional. In this article, we review the criteria and evidence in respect of requests for assisted dying in the Netherlands, Belgium, Oregon, and Switzerland, with the aim of establishing whether individuals who receive assisted dying do so on the basis of valid requests. We conclude that the evidence suggests that individuals who receive assisted dying in the four jurisdictions examined do so on the basis of valid requests and third parties who assist death do not act unlawfully. However, further research on the elements that may undermine the validity of requests for assisted dying is warranted. More research on the reasons why requests for assisted dying are refused is also desirable.

AB Background: There is growing evidence that it is important to have well-standardized procedures for identifying the mental health needs of youths in welfare and juvenile justice institutions. One of the most widely used tools for mental health screening in the juvenile justice system is the Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument-second version (MAYSI-2). To contribute to the body of research examining the utility of the MAYSI-2 as a mental health screening tool; the first objective of the current study was to examine the relationship between the MAYSI-2 and the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children, Present and Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL) in a sample of Swiss youths in welfare and juvenile justice institutions using a cross-sectional design. Secondly, as the sample was drawn from the French, German-and Italian-speaking parts of Switzerland, the three languages were represented in the total sample and consequently differences between the language regions were analyzed as well. The third objective was to examine gender differences in this relationship.
   Methods: Participants were 297 boys and 149 girls (mean age = 16.2, SD = 2.5) recruited from 64 youth welfare and juvenile justice institutions in Switzerland. The MAYSI-2 was used to screen for mental health or behavioral problems that could require further evaluation. Psychiatric classification was based on the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children, Present and Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL). Binomial logistic regression analysis was used to predict (cluster of) psychiatric disorders from MAYSI-2 scales.
   Results: The regression analyses revealed that the MAYSI-2 scales generally related well to their corresponding homotypic (cluster of) psychiatric disorders. For example, the alcohol/drug use scale identified the presence of any substance use disorder and the suicide ideation scale identified youths reporting suicide ideation or suicide attempts. Several MAYSI-2 scales were also related to heterotypic (cluster of) psychiatric disorders. For example, the MAYSI-2 scale alcohol/drug use, was positively related to any disruptive disorder. Furthermore, the results revealed gender differences in the relationship between the MAYSI-2 and K-SADS-PL (e.g., in the boys' subsample no MAYSI-2 scale was significantly related to any affective disorder; whereas, in the girls' subsample the MAYSI-2 scales depressed-anxious and somatic complaints were significantly related to any affective disorder).
   Conclusions: Overall, The MAYSI-2 seems to serve well as a first-stage screen to identify service needs for youths in welfare and juvenile justice institutions in Switzerland. Its effectiveness to identify the presence of ( cluster of) psychiatric disorders differs between genders.

AB The Assisted Dying for the Terminally III Bill proposed to legalise both euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide for those with a terminal illness in the UK. A House of Lords Select Committee was convened to scrutinise this Bill and has recently published its report, which will be debated in Parliament on October 10th 2005.
   The written and oral evidence submitted to the Select Committee represented a wide range of views on 'assisted dying'. Much of the evidence from those countries which have legalised euthanasia/physician-assisted suicide (The Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Oregon, USA) dealt with the practicalities of ending life, and the legal procedures and safeguards instigated in these countries.
   All the written and oral evidence in the public domain was scrutinised by the authors whilst the Select Committee was sitting. We have extracted those themes relevant to specialist palliative care practice and present them in this paper. We hope that this will provide a useful resource to inform the forthcoming public debate on assisted dying. The evidence of harms inherent in making such a change in the law, as presented to the Select Committee, has moved all three authors to oppose a change in the law.

ID CANCER-PATIENTS; TERMINALLY-ILL; LIFE; DIE; DESIRE; DEATH; RISK
AB In debates about euthanasia and assisted suicide, it is rare to find an article that begins with an expression of neutral interest and then proceeds to examine the various arguments and data before drawing conclusions based upon the results of a scholarly investigation. Although authors frequently give the impression of being impartial in their introduction, they invariably reach their prior conclusions. Positions tend to be clearly dichotomized: either one believes that the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide is totally acceptable or completely unacceptable in a just and moral society. Where there is some admission of a gray zone of incertitude, authors attempt to persuade us that their beliefs (preferences) are the only sensible way to resolve outstanding dilemmas. The practice of vehemently promoting a "pro" or "con" position may be useful when societies must decide to either legalize certain practices or not. Although only a handful of countries have thus far accepted the legal practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide (Belgium, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, the U.S. states of Montana, Oregon, Vermont and Washington, and Switzerland), scholarly articles in recent trends mainly promote legalization, to the point of recommending expansion of the current practices. Is this a case of the philosophers being ahead of their time in promoting and rationalizing the wave of the future? Alternatively, does the small number of countries that have legalized these practices indicate a substantial gap between the beliefs and desires of common citizens and the universe of the 'abstracted realm'? For the time being, what we do know is that more countries and states are debating legalization of euthanasia or assisted suicide, the nature of laws and legal practices vary greatly and both ethical and empirical assessments of current practices are the subject of much controversy. This article presents an examination of the premises and evidence in the rhetoric of assisted suicide and euthanasia. Inasmuch as any analysis cannot be totally impartial, we do not contend that our analysis is without influence from our experiences and philosophical affinities. Notwithstanding this caveat, we venture to propose that our scrutiny of the arguments and empirical data may offer some guidance to individuals who are attempting to reach practical conclusions based upon the available evidence, whether empirical or rationalized.

AB Since 1914, a collection of artistical productions (paintings, ceramics, writings) of psychiatric patients built up by W Morgenthaler exists at the Psychiatric University Hospital in Berne/Switzerland. Part of it are 170 water-color paintings by Rosa Marbach (1881-1926). From 1908 until 1926 when she committed suicide, she was hospitalized in two psychiatric asylums, the last years in Berne, under the diagnosis of katatonia. Her paintings demonstrate a touching contrast between her sufferings as a severely mentally ill person and the dreamy idyll of an aesthetic phantasy world in which she encounters her former sweetheart as a ,,Lowenbraut" (bride of a lion).

TI Cost-effectiveness of a Brief Structured Intervention Program Aimed at
   Preventing Repeat Suicide Attempts Among Those Who Previously Attempted
   Suicide A Secondary Analysis of the ASSIP Randomized Clinical Trial
SO JAMA NETWORK OPEN
LA English

AB IMPORTANCE This is the first cost-effectiveness analysis of a brief therapy, the Attempted Suicide Short Intervention Program (ASSIP), for individuals who attempt suicide.
   OBJECTIVE To explore the cost-effectiveness of the ASSIP intervention in the context of the Swiss health care system.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this economic evaluation, the cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from a health care perspective between January 2017 and April 2018 using data from a randomized clinical trial conducted between June 2009 and December 2014. Participants were individuals who had attempted suicide and were receiving treatment at a psychiatric university hospital in Switzerland that provides inpatient and outpatient services for suicide attempters referred from an emergency department of a general hospital.
   INTERVENTIONS The intervention group received 3 manual-based therapy sessions followed by regular personalized letters over 24 months. The control group was offered a single suicide risk assessment.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main economic analysis explored cost per suicide attempt avoided expressed in 2015 Swiss francs (CHF). Cost-effectiveness planes were plotted and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves calculated.
   RESULTS One hundred twenty participants (mean [SD] age, 37.8 [14.4] years; 66 [55%] women and 54 [45%] men) were assigned to an intervention group or a control group, each with 60 participants. At 24 months of follow-up, 5 suicide attempts were reported in the ASSIP group among 59 participants with follow-up data available, and 41were reported in the control group among 53 participants with follow-up data available. The ASSIP group had higher intervention costs, with CHF 1323 vs CHF 441 for the control group. At 24 months of follow-up, psychiatric hospital costs were lower in the ASSIP group than in the control group, although this difference was not significant (mean [SD], CHF 20 559 [38 676] vs CHF 45 488 [73 306]; mean difference, CHF -16 081; 95% CI, CHF -34717 to 1536; P = .11). General hospital costs were significantly lower for the ASSIP group. Total health care costs were also lower, but the difference was not significant (mean [SD], CHF 21302 [38 819] vs 41 287 [74 310]; difference, CHF -12 604; 95% CI, CHF -29 837 to 625; P = .14). In a basecase analysis, ASSIP was dominant, with significantly fewer reattempts at lower overall cost. The intervention had a 96% chance of being less costly and more effective. A sensitivity analysis showed a 96% and 95% chance of ASSIP being more effective and less costly at willingness-to-pay levels of CHF 0 and CHF 30000, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The ASSIP intervention is a cost-saving treatment for individuals who attempt suicide. The findings support the use of ASSIP as a treatment for suicide attempters. Further studies are needed to determine cost-effectiveness in other contexts.

AB Background: An association between isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid, sold under trade names including Accutane [Hoffmann-La Roche Inc, Basel, Switzerland]) and birth defects, depression, and suicide is well documented but controversial. A link to psychosis and exacerbation of bipolar symptoms is less extensively addressed in the literature.
   Objective: Given recent conceptualization of psychotic disorders as neurodevelopmental, and current interest in possible shared etiology of different neurodevelopmental disorders such as psychosis, autism, and intellectual disability, this review concurrently examines the literature on developmental (primarily teratogenic) and psychiatric side effects of isotretinoin exposure. The goal of concurrent review is to identify shared mechanisms in the literature that may inform future efforts to clarify the neurocognitive and psychiatric effects of isotretinoin exposure at different developmental stages or given different genetic backgrounds.
   Methods: Literature was obtained by PubMed search for the term isotretinoin in combination with each of the terms psychosis, psychiatric, and teratogenic. Resulting articles met inclusion criteria for review if they addressed psychiatric side effects of isotretinoin treatment or the neurobehavioral teratology of isotretinoin.
   Conclusions: The extent to which isotretinoin influences pediatric and adult development and cognition, and whether and why certain individuals may be susceptible to psychiatric side effects, remains to be clarified. (C) 2019 The Author. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Background: Families' experiences of assisted dying are under-investigated and families are rarely considered in clinical guidelines concerning assisted dying. Aim: To systematically review family experiences of assisted dying. Design: A systematic literature review using thematic synthesis. Data sources: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine) and PsycINFO databases (January 1992 to February 2019). Studies investigating families' experiences on the practice of legalised assisted dying were included. We excluded studies prior to legalisation within the jurisdiction, secondary data analysis and opinion papers. Results: Nineteen articles met the inclusion criteria. Publications were derived from four countries: The Netherlands, United States (Oregon, Washington and Vermont), Canada and Switzerland. Dutch studies predominately investigated family involvement in euthanasia, while Swiss and American studies only reported on assisted suicide. Eleven studies had a qualitative design, using predominately in-depth interviews; seven were retrospective surveys. Five analytical themes represented families' experiences in assisted dying: (1) context of the decision, (2) grounding the decision, (3) cognitive and emotional work, (4) experiencing the final farewell and (5) grief and bereavement. The results showed that families can be very involved in supporting patients seeking assisted dying, where open communication is maintained. Family involvement appeared to be influenced by the type of legislation in their country and the families' perception of the social acceptability of assisted dying. Conclusion: Our data confirm that families across all jurisdictions are involved in assisted suicide decision and enactment. Family needs are under-researched, and clinical guidelines should incorporate recommendations about how to consider family needs and how to provide them with evidence-based tailored interventions.

AB Background:Legal in some European countries and US states, physician-assisted suicide and voluntary active euthanasia remain under debate in these and other countries.Objectives:The aim of the study was to examine numbers, characteristics, and trends over time for assisted dying in regions where these practices are legal: Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Oregon, Washington, and Montana.Design:This was a systematic review of journal articles and official reports. Medline and Embase databases were searched for relevant studies, from inception to end of 2012. We searched the websites of the health authorities of all eligible countries and states for reports on physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia and included publications that reported on cases of physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia. We extracted information on the total number of assisted deaths, its proportion in relation to all deaths, and socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of individuals assisted to die.Results:A total of 1043 publications were identified; 25 articles and reports were retained, including series of reported cases, physician surveys, and reviews of death certificates. The percentage of physician-assisted deaths among all deaths ranged from 0.1%-0.2% in the US states and Luxembourg to 1.8%-2.9% in the Netherlands. Percentages of cases reported to the authorities increased in most countries over time. The typical person who died with assistance was a well-educated male cancer patient, aged 60-85 years.Conclusions:Despite some common characteristics between countries, we found wide variation in the extent and specific characteristics of those who died an assisted death.

AB A small proportion of deaths result from,the use of drugs with the intention to hasten death without an explicit request of the patient. Additional insight into its characteristics is needed for evaluating this practice. In the Netherlands in 2001, questionnaires were mailed to physicians that addressed the decision making that preceded their patient's death. Cases of ending life without an explicit request of the patient were compared with similar cases from 1995 and with cases from Belgium, Denmark, and Switzerland. In the Netherlands in 2001, patients receiving life-ending drugs without their explicit request were most Often 80+ years old and had cancer. Most of them were incompetent patients nearing death. Characteristics of this practice in 7995 were quite comparable, as were characteristics of this practice in Belgium, Denmark, and Switzerland. The use of drugs with the intention to hasten death without an explicit request of the patient is part of medical end-of-life practice in the studied countries, regardless of their legal framework, and it occurs in similar fashion.

AB Objective: To examine differences in end-of-life decision-making in patients dying at home, in a hospital or in a care home.
   Design: A death certificate study: certifying physicians from representative samples of death certificates, taken between June 2001 and February 2002, were sent questionnaires on the end-of-life decision-making preceding the patient's death.
   Setting: Four European countries: Belgium (Flanders), Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland (German-speaking part).
   Main outcome measures: The incidence of and communication in different end-of-life decisions: physician-assisted death, alleviation of pain/symptoms with a possible life-shortening effect, and non-treatment decisions.
   Results: Response rates ranged from 59% in Belgium to 69% in Switzerland. The total number of deaths studied was 12 492. Among all non-sudden deaths the incidence of several end-of-life decisions varied by place of death. Physician-assisted death occurred relatively more often at home (0.3-5.1%); non-treatment decisions generally occurred more often in hospitals (22.4-41.3%), although they were also frequently taken in care homes in Belgium (26.0%) and Switzerland (43.1%). Continuous deep sedation, in particular without the administration of food and fluids, was more likely to occur in hospitals. At home, end-of-life decisions were usually more often discussed with patients. The incidence of discussion with other caregivers was generally relatively low at home compared with in hospitals or care homes.
   Conclusion: The results suggest the possibility that end-of-life decision-making is related to the care setting where people die. The study results seem to call for the development of good end-of-life care options and end-of-life communication guidelines in all settings.

TI Atypical suicides or the first undiagnosed autoerotic deaths in Europe?
SO JOURNAL OF FORENSIC AND LEGAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Auto-erotic death; Asphyxiophilia; Suicide; History
AB Autoerotic accidental deaths (AAD) are increasingly reported deaths occurring during solitary sexual rituals used to enhance sexual excitement. The majority of these fatalities involve hanging or other form of self-inflicted asphyxia. The German medical literature, with the first recognized AAD published in the early 1900s, has antedated by decades the first significant AAD reports (1950-1953) in English. Early contributions in languages other than English and German are mostly overlooked in current AAD reviews, although AAD were recognised in some European countries as early as the 1940s and 1950s. For a variety of reasons, it is likely that, before the description of the first AAD in the medical literature, some asphyxia deaths have been classified as suicides with peculiar features, instead of as accidents resulting from life-threatening sexual practices. In the present study, we review and comment on three such atypical asphyxia deaths investigated in central Europe (Austria, Italy, Switzerland) during the period 1821 to 1927. The retrospective analysis of these cases revealed some circumstantial and individual features which nowadays could be linked to AAD, and disclosed the reluctance of medical examiners to analyse their motivational, and possibly sexual, background. The medico-legal approach to some autopsy findings of these cases also illustrates some controversial diagnostic issues regarding mechanical asphyxia, issues recurrently debated during the 19th century.

ID LAST 6 MONTHS; HEART-FAILURE; RESOURCE USE; CARE; LIFE
AB Increased life expectancy, which reflects progress in living conditions, medical knowledge and technology, has given rise to an aging of the population. Thus, the number of older subjects requiring care has increased. As a result, the resources that modern state must devote to healthcare are increasing, directly affecting the cost of health insurance premiums to taxpayers. This has resulted in a certain social stigma surrounding medical costs of older persons, causing them to feel insecure and guilty, sometimes to the point where they forgo care or even envisage assisted suicide, lest they become an economic burden on their loved ones. Explicit rationing of access to care or reimbursement of medical services does not seem to globally reduce healthcare costs (reduction of outpatient costs, but a strong increase in hospital costs). Therefore, an ethical approach established equitably and knowingly through shared decision-making by clinicians and patients could consent to omitting certain diagnostic procedures or onerous and futile care, thereby, contributing, in parallel, to restricting increases in health costs.

ID INCOME INEQUALITY; POPULATION HEALTH; ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; DETERMINANT;
   TRENDS
AB We investigate whether changes in economic inequality affect mortality in rich countries. To answer this question we use a new source of data on income inequality: tax data on the share of pretax income going to the richest 10% of the population in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the US between 1903 and 2003. Although this measure is not a good proxy for inequality within the bottom half of the income distribution, it is a good proxy for changes in the top half of the distribution and for the Gini coefficient. In the absence of country and year fixed effects, the income share of the top decile is negatively related to life expectancy and positively related to infant mortality. However, in our preferred fixed-effects specification these relationships are weak, statistically insignificant, and likely to change their sign. Nor do our data suggest that changes in the income share of the richest 10% affect homicide or suicide rates. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A qualitative study on existential suffering and assisted suicide in
   Switzerland
SO BMC MEDICAL ETHICS
LA English
DT Article
ID OF-LIFE; EUTHANASIA; REQUEST; DIAGNOSIS; END
AB BackgroundIn Switzerland, people can be granted access to assisted suicide (AS) on condition that the person whose wish is to die performs the fatal act, that he has his decisional capacity and that the assisting person's conduct is not selfishly motivated. No restrictions relating to the ground of suffering are mentioned in the act. Existential suffering as a reason for wanting to die, however, gives raise to controversial issues. Moreover, existential suffering lacks definition and no consensus exists on how to evaluate and manage it. This study explores the perspectives of care professionals and volunteers from a right-to-die organization on existential suffering as a motive for assisted suicide requests.MethodsA qualitative study based on face-to-face interviews was conducted with twenty-six participants: palliative care and primary care providers as well as EXIT right-to-die organization volunteers. Elements from the grounded theory approach were used.ResultsThe twenty-six participants described existential suffering in a multiplicity of individual ways. In total, sixty-three stories were recounted. Their representations were grouped into eight categories: physical decline and its consequences, loneliness, fear of the future, life is over, loss of social significance, loss of hope for a better future, being a financial burden and loss of pleasurable activities. According to all participants, suffering coming from the loss of self-identity was always linked to physical decline, as if one's image completely defined someone's identity. Society's perception of old people and vulnerable people were also often questioned. Another interesting point was that only four stories referring to a pure existential suffering were found. This suffering was related to a feeling that life has come to an end, without identification of any other related restriction or suffering.ConclusionsExistential suffering is multifaceted. Legislators and right-to-die organisations have to address the question of what make a AS acceptable. The plurality of existential suffering implies the need of a very personalized care. A better understanding of what it is made of could provide a toolbox to people concerned by these requests, helping them to explore it in order to offer suffering people a wider range of alternatives.

AB Since 2004, the psychiatric Department of the University of Lausanne has run a service dedicated to first episode psychosis (FEP). The drop out after a first hospitalization, a bad prognosis in relationship with the duration of untreated psychosis and a high percentage of suicide attempts before the onset of psychosis were definite arguments to take this issue seriously. In this article, we intend to describe from a practical point of view our program for FEP by stressing the importance of case management. After describing shortly the new trend throughout the world towards emerging psychosis, we will focus on our work in Lausanne and conclude by our research centered on this young population.

AB Objective: Very few studies specifically have examined the health status of 20-year-olds. The purpose of the present study is to examine the changes in health status and behaviour among young Swiss adults between 1993 and 2003.
   Methods: The present study used data from the Swiss Federal Surveys of Adolescents, conducted in 1993 and 2003 among 20-year-olds in Switzerland. The study sample included military recruits and a representative community cohort. More than 20,000 subjects participated in each survey.
   Results: Young adults in 2003 reported fewer traffic- and sports-related accidents, but more work-related and other accidents versus young adults in 1993. A greater percentage of men were over-weight or obese in 2003. Also in 2003, a greater percentage of males and females regularly used alcohol, cigarettes and cannabis. In particular, the number that smoked cigarettes daily increased by almost 30% and daily cannabis users increased more than two-fold. Young adults reported higher rates of inter-personal violence and theft in 2003. Compared to 1993, in 2003 young adults were more likely to report a sense of coherence; they also had fewer thoughts of suicide, but a greater sense that life is meaningless.
   Conclusions: Our study provides the first Swiss data comparing the health status of 20-year-olds a decade apart. The findings suggest a significant increase in substance use. Health prevention efforts among young adults ages 18-24 should focus on substance use. In addition, developing strategies to decrease interpersonal violence, delinquent behaviour, and obesity should be a major public health priority.

AB Background: Euthanasia requests have increased as the number of debilitated patients rises in both developed and developing countries such as India due to medical, psychosocial-emotional, socioenvironmental, and existential issues amid fears of potential misuse. World's position: Albania, Colombia, the Netherlands, and Switzerland permit euthanasia conditionally. Australia's legalization of euthanasia has been withdrawn. The United States permits withdrawal of life support. Mexico and Norway permit active euthanasia. India's position: Following the Aruna Shanbaug case the Supreme Court granted legal sanction to passive, but not active, euthanasia that is valid till the Parliament legislates on euthanasia. Handling euthanasia requests: Acknowledging the complexity of the problem; individualizing the palliative approach; and accepting the There is no alternative' or There is no answer' (TINA) factor.

AB Objectives: To investigate attitudes to end-of-life decisions, and the influence of cultural factors and of doctors' personal characteristics on these attitudes.
   Method. As part of a European research project (EURELD), a study on attitudes towards medical end-of-life decisions was conducted among doctors in the German-, French-, and Italian-, speaking areas of Switzerland. A written questionnaire was sent to a random sample of nine different types of specialist; it presented 14 statements on end-of-life decisions and doctors were asked whether they agreed or disagreed with them.
   Results: The response rate was 64%. 1360 questionnaires were studied. The results show general agreement with statements on the alleviation of pain and other symptoms with possible life-shortening effect, as well as on non-treatment decisions. The language region was a strong determinant of agreement on some attitudes towards end-of-life decisions. Agreement on the use of lethal drugs and alleviation of pain and other symptoms with possible life-shortening effect was higher among French-speaking than among German- and Italian-speaking doctors. For non-treatment decisions, agreement was higher in the German-speaking region than in the French- and Italian-speaking regions of the country. Italian-speaking doctors.. were,,strongly opposed to any kind of end-of-life decision. Religious believers and those who attended a larger number of terminal patients tended to disagree more often with end-of-life decisions than the other doctors.
   Conclusions: In end-of-life decision-making, Switzerland represents "Europe in miniature". The impact on end-of-life decisions of cultural factors and the number of terminal patients attended needs further consideration.

AB Hanging is one of the most common methods of suicide, and, although it is known that decomposition and patterns of insect fauna colonization of hanging cadavers differ from those of cadavers decomposing on the ground, these differences have only been sparsely studied in Europe so far. We studied the decomposition and insect colonization patterns of ten pig (Sus scrofa domestica) carcasses in a spruce forest near Neuchatel, Switzerland, over a 32-day period in summer 2013 (July 1st - August 2nd). Five pig carcasses were suspended horizontally in metal cages one meter above the ground and five carcasses were placed directly on the ground. The species occurrence and abundance of Coleoptera and Diptera recovered from passive pitfall traps and collected manually on the carcasses were recorded. Indicator species of decomposition stages and suspended vs. ground cadavers were identified by Indicator Value (IndVal) analysis. The ground carcasses decomposed significantly faster than the suspended carcasses. Coleoptera and Diptera communities differed significantly over time, between treatment, and the treatment effect varied over time. Diptera were evenly distributed among the two treatments. Coleoptera were more abundant and less differentiated on the ground carcasses and represent better indicators of cadavers decomposing on the soil as well as decomposition stages. Our results suggest possible applications such as evaluating if a hanged cadaver has been dropped to the ground, or inversely if a cadaver first lying on the soil has later been hung to fake a suicide. However differences among studies suggest possible effects of meso-climate determined by habitat which should be explored further.

AB AIMS OF THE STUDY: Self-harm is a major risk factor for suicide but remains poorly documented. No data on self-harm in French-speaking Switzerland exist. To address this deficiency, the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health commissioned a specific self-harm monitoring programme. We present and discuss its implementation and first findings.
   METHODS: Every patient aged 18-65 years presenting for self-harm to the emergency departments of the Lausanne and Neuchatel general hospitals were included in the monitoring programme over a 10-month period (December 2016 to September 2017). Clinicians collected anonymous sociodemographic and clinical data.
   RESULTS: The sample included 490 patients (54.9% female and 45.1% male) for 554 episodes of self-harm, showing a higher proportion of patients aged 18-34 (49.2%) than older age groups (35-49, 33.7% and 50-65, 17.1%). Patients were mostly single (56.1%) and in problematic socioeconomic situations (65.7%). Self-poisoning was the most commonly used method (58.2%) and was preferred by women (71% of females and 42.5% of males, Fisher's exact test, p < 0.001) and the majority of patients (53.3%) had experienced at least one previous episode of self-harm. The self-harm rate was 220 per 100,000 inhabitants in Lausanne and 140 in Neuchatel. Suicidal intent was clear for 50.6% of the overall sample, unclear for 25.1% and absent for 24.3%. It differed significantly between sites (.2(2) = 9.068, p = 0.011) as Lausanne reported more incidents of unclear intent (27.7% versus 17.4% in Neuchatel) and Neuchatel more incidents with absence of intent (33.1% versus 21.3% in Lausanne). In Lausanne, patients more frequently resorted to methods such as jumping from a height (11.4%) and hanging (9%) than in Neuchatel (1.6% and 4.9%, Fisher's exact test, p = 0.006).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results are globally consistent with previous research on self-harm. We found significant intersite differences in methods, suicidal intent and self-harm rates. Our findings highlight the importance of implementing local self-harm monitoring to identify specific at-risk groups and develop targeted preventive intervention.

TI Paraplegia after suicidal attempt
SO PSYCHIATRISCHE PRAXIS
LA German
DT Article
ID SPINAL-CORD INJURY; DIALYSIS; DENMARK
AB For the first time in Switzerland, patients were followed up who had become paraplegic after a suicidal attempt, and who had to spend a certain time in a center for paraplegics (corresponding to 3% of all traumatically induced cases of myeloparalysis). Records and catamnestic data of patients with paraplegia after suicidal attempt during the years 1982-1996 (n = 38) - all being or having been patients of the centers for paraplegics of Basel and Nottwil (canton of Lucerne) - were evaluated. Catamnestic investigations performed from one month to 14 years after the suicidal attempt, based on a structured dialogue with a standardized, computerized questionnaire, led, among others, to the following conclusions: The average age of these patients (20 males and 18 females) was 38 years. The most frequently encountered suicidal method, leading to the paraplegic lesion, was a fall from a window of a building (89,6%). In 55% of the cases, psychiatric disease, especially depression, alcohol and drug dependence, had been diagnosed prior to the suicidal attempt. 37% of patients hat attempted suicide at least once before the attempt leading to the paraplegic condition. 34% had been hospitalized for psychiatric reasons on an earlier occasion. In 26%, a farewell letter was written. As far as the level of the paraplegic lesions is concerned, patients were equally distributed (50% each) between thoracal/cervical and lumbar lesions. The associated sexual impairment was experienced by each one of the 38 patients as a most disturbing problem. Despite the limited number of cases and the partially short time interval between the suicidal attempt and the follow-up investigation, results seem to indicate that such patients are not likely to commit suicide on a later occasion. One single patient had tried to commit suicide several times after the suicidal attempt event under discussion.

AB We assessed change between 1996 and 2006 in the opinions of the general public on priorities for the prevention of health problems.
   Postal questionnaire surveys in 1996 and 2006, in representative samples of the general population of Geneva, Switzerland. Participants indicated, for each of 13 health problems, a priority rating for the spending of prevention resources.
   There were 742 participants in 1996 (response rate 75%) and 1487 in 2006 (response rate 76%). According to participants, in 2006, resources should be spent, with priority, for: the prevention of sexual abuse of children (67% answered 'high priority'), illegal drugs (58%), AIDS (55%), tobacco smoking (45%), road traffic accidents (43%), alcoholism (42%), family violence (42%), suicide in young people (39%), mammography screening for breast cancer (37%), abuse of medications (27%), cannabis use (24%), poor diet (22%) and lack of physical activity (20%). Between 1996 and 2006, the largest change was observed for tobacco smoking (+18.6% answered 'high priority'), poor diet (+11.4%), lack of physical activity (+10.8%) and AIDS (-10.8%, P < 0.001 for all change scores).
   Smoking, poor diet and lack of physical activity were more likely to be perceived as priorities in 2006 than in 1996, whereas priority ratings decreased for AIDS. The prevention of sexual abuse of children was perceived as the highest priority by all respondent groups.

AB Queering Medicine addresses the role of medicine and psychology in transgender healthcare against a historically heavily charged relationship between transgender persons and professionals. Improved and adequate professional care for transgender persons will only be succesful when prejudices and traditional convictions about the gender dichotomy will be overcome. It is crucial for a professional and respectful relationship with transgender persons that medicine and psychology learn to accept gender individuality and diversity. This article also describes terminology, and briefly depicts the historical background of transgender medicine. Moreover recommended proceedings for Germany, Austria and Switzerland are described and critically appraised. Also, special attention is paid to the recently released German S3-guideline on ,Gender incongruence, genderdysphoria and trans-health'. Last but not least role and duties of endocrinologists dealing with transgender persons is illuminated.

AB This study provides an overview of homicide clearance in four West European countries: Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. Using data from the European Homicide Monitor, employing similar definitions and uniform coding schemes, this study allowed for unique cross-country comparisons in factors influencing differences in homicide clearance rates. Findings based on homicides occurring in the period 2009-14 revealed overall low homicide rates in all countries, with a wide variety in homicide clearance rates, ranging from 77 percent in the Netherlands to 98 percent in Finland. Results further showed that both event-based as well as victim-based characteristics significantly influenced the likelihood of homicide clearance, suggesting that homicide clearance rates can, for a large part, be attributed to the prevalent types of homicide in each of these European countries.

DE Euthanasia; Minors; Belgium; Legal competence
ID SWITZERLAND; CHILDREN; SUICIDE
AB In 2014, the Belgian Euthanasia Law was amended so as to extend the possibility of obtaining euthanasia to minors who have the capacity for discernment. The amendment led to considerable debate among Belgian legal experts, health care professionals and ethicists, in large part due to concerns about the scope and assessment of the minor's capacity for discernment', a concept first introduced in Belgian medical law by the amendment. This article offers a critical legal analysis of the concept of capacity for discernment' and its implications for euthanasia practice in Belgium. We do so by focusing on a ruling of the Belgian Constitutional Court of 29 October 2015, where the concept figured prominently in the examination of the constitutionality of the amendment. This approach also allows us to shed light on the interpretation of several core aspects of the original 2002 Euthanasia Law and its 2014 amendment.

AB The authors retrospectively reviewed all homicides of children under 15 years of age referred to the Institute of Legal Medicine in Lausanne from January 1990 to December 2000. We report on 41 cases during this eleven-year period. Among those, 17 newborns and 24 older children, a higher proportion of males was found. Regarding newborn homicides, when the identity of the mother was known she was always identified as the perpetrator. With non-newborn homicides, the majority of the victims were killed at home and knew the offender. Two common profiles of these homicides could be determined. In the first scenario, one of the parents shot all the children and committed suicide afterwards. The second profile is defined as 'fatal child abuse' and concerned younger victims whose cause of death was the result of a cranio-cerebral trauma from battering or shaken baby syndrome.

AB Significant others are often crucial for suicidal persons or suicide attempters' access to care, yet little is known about their efforts to seek help. This article presents the findings of a qualitative pilot study carried out in Switzerland on the help-seeking process of 18 significant others, their perception of the care received by their loved one, and the interactions and collaboration they experienced with professionals. Most significant others repeatedly sought out support for their loved one and themselves. The help-seeking process seemed mostly difficult, was seldom successful on the first attempt, and was filled with multiple difficulties, such as availability and continuity of care and cooperation issues with professionals. Two-thirds of participants were not satisfied with the care provided to their loved ones and half of them faced challenges in their cooperation with professionals, i.e., poor sharing of information or not being acknowledged as partners or supported by professionals. Based on their experience, providing education about suicidal crises and care programs to significant others might lighten their burden and improve their cooperation with professionals, who in turn may benefit from training in communication issues and specific methods of cooperation with significant others in suicidal situations.

AB Adolescents seeking professional help with their gender identity development often present with psychological difficulties. Existing literature on psychological functioning of gender diverse young people is limited and mostly bound to national chart reviews. This study examined the prevalence of psychological functioning and peer relationship problems in adolescents across four European specialist gender services (The Netherlands, Belgium, the UK, and Switzerland), using the Child Behavioural Checklist (CBCL) and the Youth Self-Report (YSR). Differences in psychological functioning and peer relationships were found in gender diverse adolescents across Europe. Overall, emotional and behavioural problems and peer relationship problems were most prevalent in adolescents from the UK, followed by Switzerland and Belgium. The least behavioural and emotional problems and peer relationship problems were reported by adolescents from The Netherlands. Across the four clinics, a similar pattern of gender differences was found. Birth-assigned girls showed more behavioural problems and externalising problems in the clinical range, as reported by their parents. According to self-report, internalising problems in the clinical range were more prevalent in adolescent birth-assigned boys. More research is needed to gain a better understanding of the difference in clinical presentations in gender diverse adolescents and to investigate what contextual factors that may contribute to this.

   HOPELESSNESS; DEPRESSION
AB Objectives: To examine whether help-negation (i.e. not accepting or accessing available helping resources) among suicidal youth could also be found in a Swiss sample.
   Methods: Data from 7335 16-20-year olds, who participated in the 2002 Swiss Multicentre Adolescent Survey on Health, were analyzed. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to predict if a person would generally talk with no one when having a mental health problem (e.g. feeling depressed or anxious). Not talking about such problems was interpreted as indicator for help-negation. The main predictor was suicide severity. Additionally, an indicator of depression and socio-demographic variables were included in the statistical models.
   Results: People with higher levels of suicidality and depression were more likely to report that they would not talk about mental health problems. More non-Swiss (vs. Swiss) participants and apprentices (vs. students) reported high suicidality. Furthermore, these specific sub-groups seemed to be particularly likely to negate help.
   Conclusion: Help-negation can also be found in a Swiss sample of young people and seems to be particularly pronounced in some socio-demographic subgroups. By reducing this reluctance to seek help, premature death due to suicide might be reduced. (C) 2016 Asociacion Universitaria de Zaragoza para el Progreso de la Psiquiatria y la Salud Mental.

TI Legalising physician-assisted suicide in South Africa: Should it even be
   considered?
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOETHICS AND LAW
LA English
DT Article
ID EUTHANASIA; ETHICS
AB For many years, euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) have been topics that no one dared to mention. However, over the past few decades, the subject has emerged as a very pertinent issue around the world, for a number of reasons - so much so that these life-ending practices have already been legalised or decriminalised in some developed countries, such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland, and within certain states of the USA. In the states and countries where the practices have been legalised, or at least decriminalised, the effects of the legalisation have been relatively well documented. On the other hand, in countries like South Africa (SA), where they are illegal, whether or not they should be legalised (taking into consideration all the associated benefits and consequences) should be discussed, and a consensus reached, sooner rather than later. A consensus regarding the feasibility of legalising euthanasia and/or PAS in SA is needed because these practices (or mere requests for them) are becoming increasingly common, especially among people with terminal illnesses. Furthermore, the relative ease with which patients who desperately seek to end their life through either of the aforementioned methods, and are able to access them - by applying for them in countries where the pertinent laws and regulations are adjudged to be more liberal - is alarming. This highlights the importance and need for each country to set clear laws or parameters (and regulations, where applicable) that relate to these life-ending practices.

AB Background: Some patients develop severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) which is therapy-refractory. The needs of these patients sometimes remain unmet by therapeutic interventions and they are at high risk of receiving care that is inconsistent with their life goals. Scholarly discourse has recently begun to address the suitability of palliative care approaches targeting at enhancing quality of life for these patients, but remains to be developed.
   Method: A cross-sectional survey asked 1311 German-speaking psychiatrists in Switzerland (the total number of German-speaking members of the Swiss Society for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy) about the care of SPMI patients in general, and about palliative care approaches in particular. 457 (34.9%) returned the completed survey. In addition, participants were asked to evaluate three case vignettes of patients with SPMI.
   Results: The reduction of suffering and maintaining daily life functioning of the patient were rated as considerably more important in the treatment of SPMI than impeding suicide and curing the underlying illness. There was broad agreement that SPMI can be terminal (93.7%), and that curative approaches may sometimes be futile (e.g. 72.4% for the anorexia nervosa case vignette). Furthermore, more than 75% of the participating psychiatrists were in favour of palliative care approaches for SPMI.
   Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest that the participating psychiatrists in Switzerland regard certain forms of SPMI as posing high risk of death. Additionally, a majority of respondents consider palliative care approaches appropriate for this vulnerable group of patients. However, the generalizability of the results to all psychiatrists in Switzerland or other mental health professionals involved in the care of SPMI is limited. This limitation is important considering the reservations towards palliative care in the context of psychiatric illness, mainly because of the association with death and futility. Palliative care approaches, however, are applicable in conjunction with other therapies intended to prolong life. A next step could be to involve service users and develop a consensus of what palliative care might encompass in SPMI. A framework for identifying which patients might benefit from palliative care, should be explored for the future development of care for SPMI patients.

AB The Foehn is a warm, dry, downslope wind found on the lee side of mountains; the type-location for this adiabatic wind is the European Alps. In the Swiss village of Leukerbad, residents are quite familiar with the Foehn, which sweeps regularly through the main Rhone valley from the southeast. Leukerbad, located in a side valley, rarely experiences the full force of the Foehn, but the effects of this wind are well known: people say that the Foehn brings headaches, makes them depressed, invites suicide, and generates a feeling of ill health. In contrast, another wind occurring in this valley, the Gemmiwind - which comes over the Gemmi pass into Leukerbad from the north - is known only as a cold wind. Drawing on ethnographic data and literary representations as well as biomedical and meteorological analyses, we consider the meanings of the Foehn as it has penetrated the bodies and minds of mountain inhabitants in Switzerland and beyond.

AB Introduction. Human contact with potentially toxic plants, which may occur through abuse or by accident or attempted suicide, is frequent and sometimes results in clinically significant toxicity. Objective. The aim of the present study was to identify which plants may lead to severe poisoning, and to define the clinical relevance of plant toxicity for humans in Switzerland. Methods. We analyzed 42 193 cases of human plant exposure and 255 acute moderate, severe, and lethal poisonings, which were reported to the Swiss Toxicological Information Centre between January 1995 and December 2009. Results. Plant contact was rarely responsible for serious poisonings. Lethal intoxications were extremely rare and were caused by plants with cardiotoxic (Taxus baccata) or mitosis-inhibiting (Colchicum autumnale) properties. Conclusions. Most often, plant contact was accidental and patients remained asymptomatic or developed mild symptoms, which fully resolved within a short time.

AB Objectives: To determine the direction and magnitude of participation bias in end-of-life research.
   Methods: Within the framework of a European survey on medical end-of-life decisions, a non-response study was conducted among physicians in Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. People were asked about their attitudes and experiences in the area of medial end-of-life decision. The response rates ranged from 12.8% (Netherlands) to 39.4% (Switzerland). The responders (n = 5403) and the non-responders (n = 866) were compared regarding socio-demographic characteristics, experiences with terminal patients and agreement with attitudes towards "end-of-life decisions". The reasons for non-participation to the study were analyzed.
   Results: Non-response did not cause socio-demographic distortion, but non-responders had statistically significantly fewer terminal patients than responders. Agreement rates were statistically significantly higher among responders than among non-responders for euthanasia, non-treatment decision and life-preserving statements. Neutral answers were statistically significantly more frequent among non-responders than among responders for life-preserving and euthanasia statements. The most commonly mentioned reason for non-participation was "lack of time".
   Conclusion: Non-participation does cause an overestimation of proponents of life-shortening, as well as of life-preserving end-of-life decisions. Non-responders more often have ambiguous attitudes towards end-of-life decisions than responders.

AB Objective: Switzerland has mountains and valleys complicating the access to a hospital and critical care in case of emergencies. Treatment success for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or stroke depends on timely treatment. We examined the relationship between distance to different hospital types and mortality from AMI or stroke in the Swiss National Cohort (SNC) Study.
   Design and setting: The SNC is a longitudinal mortality study of the census 2000 population of Switzerland. For 4.5 million Swiss residents not living in a nursing home and older than 30 years in the year 2000, we calculated driving time and straight-line distance from their home to the nearest acute, acute with emergency room, central and university hospital (in total 173 hospitals). On the basis of quintiles, we used multivariable Cox proportional hazard models to estimate HRs of AMI and stroke mortality for driving time distance groups compared to the closest distance group.
   Results: Over 8 years, 19 301 AMI and 21 931 stroke deaths occurred. Mean driving time to the nearest acute hospital was 6.5 min (29.7 min to a university hospital). For AMI mortality, driving time to a university hospital showed the strongest association among the four types of hospitals with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.19 (95% CI 1.10 to 1.30) and 1.10 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.20) for men and women aged 65+ years when comparing the highest quintile with the lowest quintile of driving time. For stroke mortality, the association with university hospital driving time was less pronounced than for AMI mortality and did not show a clear incremental pattern with increasing driving time. There was no association with driving time to the nearest hospital.
   Conclusions: The increasing AMI mortality with increasing driving time to the nearest university hospital but not to any nearest hospital reflects a complex interplay of many factors along the care pathway.

AB A major issue in the care of terminally ill patients is communication and information provision. This paper reports the extent to which physicians in Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland discuss topics relevant to end of life care with terminally ill patients and their relatives (without first informing the patient), and possible associations between physician-specific characteristics and such discussions. Response rates to the postal survey ranged from 39% to 68% (n = 10139). Physicians in most of the countries except Italy in principle, always' discuss issues related to terminal illness with their patients but not with patients' relatives without first informing the patient, unless the relatives ask. Cross-national differences remained strong after controlling for physician characteristics. The majority of physicians appeared to support the principle of patient-centred care to terminally ill patients, consistent with palliative care philosophy and with the law and/or professional guidelines in most of the countries studied.

AB In the context of an European collaborative research project (EURELD), a study on attitudes towards medical end-of-life decisions was conducted among physicians in Belgium, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. Australia also joined the consortium. A written questionnaire with structured questions was sent to practising physicians from specialties frequently involved in the care of dying patients. 10,139 questionnaires were studied. Response rate was equal to or larger than 50% in all countries except Italy (39%). Apart from general agreement with respect to the alleviation of pain and symptoms with possible life-shortening effect, there was large variation in support-between and within countries-for medical decision that may result in the hastening of death. A principal component factor analysis found that 58% of the variance of the responses is explained by four factors. 'Country' explained the largest part of the variation of the standardized factor scores. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID CARE; END; IMPACT
AB Background: Lack of health insurance claims (HIC) in the last year of life might indicate suboptimal end-of-life care, but reasons for no HIC are not fully understood because information on causes of death is often missing. We investigated association of no HIC with characteristics of individuals and their place of residence.
   Methods: We analysed HIC of persons who died between 2008 and 2010, which were obtained from six providers of mandatory Swiss health insurance. We probabilistically linked these persons to death certificates to get cause of death information and analysed data using sex-stratified, multivariable logistic regression. Supplementary analyses looked at selected subgroups of persons according to the primary cause of death.
   Results: The study population included 113,277 persons (46% males). Among these persons, 1199 (proportion 0.022, 95% CI: 0.021-0.024) males and 803 (0.013, 95% CI: 0.012-0.014) females had no HIC during the last year of life. We found sociodemographic and health differentials in the lack of HIC at the last year of life among these 2002 persons. The likelihood of having no HIC decreased steeply with older age. Those who died of cancer were more likely to have HIC (adjusted odds ratio for males 0.17, 95% CI: 0.13-0.22; females 0.19, 95% CI: 0.12-0.28) whereas those dying of mental and behavioural disorders (AOR males 1.83, 95% CI: 1.42-2.37; females 1.65, 95% CI: 1.27-2.14), and males dying of suicide (AOR 2.15, 95% CI: 1.72-2.69) and accidents (AOR 2.41, 95% CI: 1.96-2.97) were more likely to have none. Single, widowed, and divorced persons also were more likely to have no HIC (AORs in range of 1.29-1.80). There was little or no association between the lack of HIC and characteristics of region of residence. Patterns of no HIC differed across main causes of death. Associations with age and civil status differed in particular for persons who died of cancer, suicide, accidents and assaults, and mental and behavioural disorders.
   Conclusions: Particular groups might be more likely to not seek care or not report health insurance costs to insurers. Researchers should be aware of this aspect of health insurance data and account for persons who lack HIC.

AB Background: High prevalences of depression and suicidality have been found among gay men. This paper assesses the possible impact of Blues-out, a depression awareness campaign based on the European Alliance Against Depression targeting the gay/lesbian community in Geneva, Switzerland.
   Methods: In 2007 and 2011, pre- and post-intervention surveys were conducted among two distinct samples of gay men in Geneva, recruited by probability-based time-space sampling. Effect sizes and net percent changes are reported for mental health literacy and mental health outcomes in 2007 and 2011 as well as among men aware and unaware of Blues-out in 2011.
   Results: 43% of the respondents correctly recognized depression in 2011 with no change vis-a-vis 2007. Despite small effect sizes, significant net decreases (from -18% to -28%) were seen in lifetime suicide plans, 12-month suicidal ideation, lifetime depression, and 4-week psychological distress between 2007 and 2011. These decreases were not accompanied by changes in any of the numerous items on attitudes/knowledge, found only when comparing men aware and unaware of Blues-out in 2011. More men aware of Blues-out found specialists and psychological therapies helpful than their counterparts and correctly identified depression and gay men's greater risk for depression.
   Limitations: Community-level assessment with no control.
   Conclusions: Although improvement in depression recognition and decrease in suicide attempts could not be replicated unequivocally in this adapted intervention among gay men, there are indications that this evidence-based depression awareness campaign may have lessened suicidality and mental morbidity and improved mental health literacy and help-seeking.

AB This paper unpacks the slippery slope argument as it pertains to assisted death.
   The assisted-death regimes of the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and the states of Washington and Oregon are discussed and examined with respect to the slippery slope analytical rubric. In addition to providing a preliminary explanation of how the slippery slope argument has been academically defined and constructed, the paper examines assisted-death models from the perspective of considering what might exist at the top and at the bottom of the slippery slope. It also explores the nature and scope of safeguards implemented to avoid slippage, and shows that what lies at the top and bottom of the slippery slope may be different from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. After identifying some of the recent concerns that have arisen within each of the jurisdictions (concerns that might be viewed by some as evidence of slide), the paper concludes by making note of certain critical issues in the current assisted-death debate that merit deeper examination.

DT Article
DE risk behaviours; authoritarianism; young men
ID AMBIVALENT SEXISM
AB Objectives: As possible explanations for risk behaviour in young men past strains, lack of resources, social individualisation processes and genderspecific aspects are discussed. For this study the concept of authoritarianism was used as the model for analysis.
   Methods: 4235 recruits from the German-speaking part of Switzerland were surveyed with regard to risk behaviours; in sexuality, alcohol consumption, suicide tendency, and violence. The predicting variables for non-risk behaviours and for different risk behaviour patterns were identified by means of logistic regression analysis. The main predicting variables included authoritarianism, disposition to discriminate, stressful life events, and personal and social resources.
   Results: The results show that the different aspects of authoritarianism not only influence prejudice and aggression towards dissenters as has been shown in other studies, but risk behaviours in general. Between the aspects of authoritarianism and risk behaviour patterns positive as well as negative correlations were found.
   Conclusion: We conclude that there are different types of authoritarian men who differ with regard to risk behaviours.

AB Context. Eight jurisdictions in the U.S. currently permit medical aid-in-dying (AID), yet little is known about the direct experience of caregivers in supporting a loved one through the process.
   Objectives. To explore the experiences of lay caregivers involved with AID in the U.S., focusing on the day of death.
   Methods. Semistructured in-depth interviews were conducted with caregivers of terminally ill patients who pursued AID under Vermont's 2013 "Patient Choice and Control at End of Life" Act. Deidentified interview transcripts were analyzed using an inductive iterative approach.
   Results. The final sample included 19 caregivers who had cared for a total of 11 patients. Most caregivers were females (89%), and more than half were close friends. Their mean age was 60.3. Social support provided by caregivers on the day of an AID death fell into two broad categories: emotional and instrumental. These overarching forms of support were further distributed between four distinct temporal phases: preparation, ingestion, waiting, and after death.
   Conclusion. Although AID is often presented as a simple matter of individual choice and autonomy, most patients who pursue it do so with tremendous support from caregivers, who are in turn deeply implicated, socially and morally, in the process. Including caregivers in education and planning, where warranted, can mitigate feelings of unpreparedness and ensure a smoother experience for everyone involved.

AB Background: This study estimates the frequency of different end-of-life decisions (ELDs) in medical practice in the UK, compares these with other countries and assesses doctors' views on the adequacy of current UK law. Method: Postal survey of 857 UK medical practitioners using a questionnaire used in other countries. Findings: The proportion of UK deaths involving an ELD were: 1) voluntary euthanasia 0.16% (0-0.36), 2) physician-assisted suicide 0.00%, 3) ending of life without an explicit request from patient 0.33% (0-0.76), 4) alleviation of symptoms with possibly life shortening effect 32.8% (28.1-37.6), 5) non-treatment decisions 30.3% (26.0-34.6). ELDs 1 and 2 were significantly less frequent than in the Netherlands and Australia; ELD 2 was also less frequent than Switzerland. ELD 3 was less frequent than in Belgium and Australia. Comparison of UK and New Zealand general practitioners showed lower rates of ELDs 4 and 5 in the UK. ELD 5 was more common than in most other European countries. A few doctors attending deaths felt UK law had inhibited or interfered with their preferred management of patients (4.6% (3.1-6.1%) of doctors) or that a new law would have facilitated better management (2.6% (1.4-3.8%) of doctors). Interpretation: The lower relative rate of ELDs involving doctor-assisted dying in the UK, and the relatively high rate of non-treatment decisions, suggests a culture of medical, decision making informed by a palliative care philosophy.

TI Attitudes toward assisted suicide and life-prolonging measures in Swiss
   ALS patients and their caregivers
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE ALS; motor neuron disease; quality of life; depression; end of life
AB Objectives: In Switzerland, assisted suicide (AS) is legal, provided that the person seeking assistance has decisional capacity and the person assisting is not motivated by reasons of self-interest. However, in this particular setting nothing is known about patients' and their caregivers' attitudes toward AS and life-prolonging measures. Methods: Data was retrieved through validated questionnaires and personal interviews in 33 patients and their caregivers covering the following domains: physical function according to the revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R), demographic data, quality of life, anxiety, depression, social situation, spirituality, burden of disease, life-prolonging, and life-shortening acts. Results: In patients the median time after diagnosis was 9 months (2 90) and the median Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) FRS-R score was 37 (22-48). The majority of patients (94%; n=31) had no desire to hasten death. Patients' and caregivers' attitudes toward Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG) and Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) differed. Significantly more patients than caregivers (21.2 versus 3.1%) stated that they were against NIV (p=0.049) and against PEG (273 versus 3.1%; p=0.031). Answers regarding tracheotomy were not significantly different (p=0.139). Caregivers scored significantly higher levels of "suffering" (p=0.007), "loneliness" (p=0.006), and "emotional distress" answering the questionnaires (p < 0.001). Suffering (p < 0.026) and loneliness (p < 0.016) were related to the score of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) in patients. Conclusion: A liberal legal setting does not necessarily promote the wish for AS. However, the desire to discuss AS is prevalent in ALS patients. There is a higher level of suffering and loneliness on the caregivers' side. A longitudinal study is warranted.

AB ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to describe the demographic, social and medical characteristics, and healthcare use of highly frequent users of a university hospital emergency department (ED) in Switzerland.MethodsA retrospective consecutive case series was performed. We included all highly frequent users, defined as patients attending the ED 12 times or more within a calendar year (1 January 2009 to 31 December 2009). We collected their characteristics and calculated a score of accumulation of risk factors of vulnerability.ResultsHighly frequent users comprised 0.1% of ED patients, and they accounted for 0.8% of all ED attendances (23 patients, 425 attendances). Of all highly frequent users, 87% had a primary care practitioner, 82.6% were unemployed, 73.9% were socially isolated, and 60.9% had a mental health or substance use primary diagnosis. One-third had attempted suicide during study period, all of them being women. They were often admitted (24.0% of attendances), and only 8.7% were uninsured. On average, they cumulated 3.3 different risk factors of vulnerability (SD 1.4).ConclusionHighly frequent users of a Swiss academic ED are a highly vulnerable population. They are in poor health and accumulate several risk factors of being even in poorer health. The small number of patients and their high level of insurance coverage make it particularly feasible to design a specific intervention to approach their needs, in close collaboration with their primary care practitioner. Elaboration of the intervention should focus on social reinsertion and risk-reduction strategies with regard to substance use, hospital admissions and suicide.

AB Background and objective: The aims of this study were to estimate the lifetime and 12-month prevalence of exposure to potentially traumatic events (PTEs) in young men in Switzerland and to assess factors and mental health outcomes associated with such events.
   Method: Data were drawn from the Cohort Study on Substance Use Risk Factors (C-SURF), encompassing 5,223 young men. Exposure to PTEs was assessed using the Post-traumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS), Trauma History Questionnaire (THQ) and Life Event Checklist (LEC).
   Results: Lifetime prevalence of PTEs was 59.4%, with 37.3% reporting multiple types of events. Twelve-month prevalence was 31.2%, with 12.7% reporting multiple types of events. Low education level of participants, high maternal education, family affluence below average, and not living with biological parents were associated with a higher risk of having experienced one or more PTEs in one's lifetime. Low education level of participants and high maternal education were also related to exposure to one or more PTEs over the past 12 months. Logistic regression analyses demonstrated that PTE exposure was directly associated with all assessed mental health outcomes. The strongest relationship was found between exposure to multiple types of PTEs and suicide attempts (adjusted OR 4.9 [95% CI: 2.9-8.4]).
   Conclusions: These results indicate that having experienced one or multiple types of PTEs is common in Swiss young men. Efforts should be intensified to reduce exposure to PTEs and prevent and treat resulting problematic mental health outcomes in young adults.

TI Psychoactive substances and violent offences: A retrospective analysis

SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID ACUTE RECREATIONAL DRUG; CANNABIS USE; COCAINE; ALCOHOL; ABUSE;
   MARIJUANA; HOMICIDE; TOXICITY; INJURIES
AB Background
   Psychoactive substances are often regarded as causal factors contributing to violent injuries, sexual abuse and homicides. While these effects have been demonstrated for some substances (e.g. cocaine), current available data for others are more controversial (e.g. cannabis) or very limited (e.g. ecstasy).
   Aims of the study
   To collect data on the type and frequency of psychoactive substance use in cases of emergency department (ED) presentations related to interpersonal violence.
   Methods
   Retrospective study at the University Hospital of Bern, Switzerland, between May 2012 and June 2016. The study covered cases of violent crime associated with psychoactive substances. Cases of isolated ethanol intoxication, suicide attempts, and substance use for medical purposes were excluded.
   Results
   The study included 103 cases among the 164,846 ED attendances. In the majority of the cases, the type of violence was bodily force (52%) related to urban violence (83%). The mean patient age was 29 years and 79% were male. 63% of the patients reported use of more than one drug; alcohol co-use was reported in 60% of the cases. Besides alcohol, the substances most often reported were cannabis (50%) and cocaine (21%). Alcohol and cannabis was also the most commonly reported substance combination (36% of the total cases). Urine drug screening was performed in 34% of the cases and cannabis and cocaine were the most commonly detected substances (46% and 19%, respectively). There were no cases of novel substances. 23% of the patients were admitted to a hospital ward, 10% to a psychiatric clinic.
   Conclusion
   Cannabis and cocaine were, besides alcohol, the substances most often reported in ED presentations related to offences of violence. Because of the high prevalence of alcohol co-use, no final conclusions can be drawn on the contribution of single substances.

   DEFINITION
AB The objective was to evaluate the prevalence of chronic conditions (CC) in adolescents in Switzerland; to describe their behaviour (leisure, sexuality, risk taking behaviour) and to compare them to those in adolescents who do not have CC in order to evaluate the impact of those conditions on their well-being. The data were obtained from the Swiss Multicentre Adolescent Survey on Health, targeting a sample of 9268 in-school adolescents aged 15 to 20 years, who answered a self-administered questionnaire. Some 11.4% of girls and 9.6% of boys declared themselves carriers of a CC. Of girls suffering from a CC, 25% (versus 13% of non carriers; P=0.007) and 38% of boys (versus 25%; P=0.002) proclaimed not to wear a seatbelt whilst driving. Of CC girls, 6.3% (versus 2.7%; P=0.000) reported within the last 12 months to have driven whilst drunk. Of the girls, 43% (versus 36%; P=0.004) and 47% (versus 39%; P=0.001) were cigarette smokers. Over 32% of boys (versus 27%; P=0.02) reported having ever used cannabis and 17% of girls (versus 13%; P=0.013) and 43% of boys (versus 36%; P=0.002) admitted drinking alcohol. The burden of their illness had important psychological consequences: 7.7% of girls (versus 3.4%; P=0.000) and 4.9% of boys (versus 2.0%; P=0.000) had attempted suicide during the previous 12 months. Conclusion: experimental behaviours are not rarer in adolescents with a chronic condition and might be explained by a need to test their limits both in terms of consumption and behaviour. Prevention and specific attention from the health caring team is necessary.

AB This study examines the use of the Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument-Second Version (MAYSI-2) for mental health needs among 1643 youngsters in residential welfare/justice institutions in Europe and the USA, identifying gender differences across countries and settings. Overall, the MAYSI-2 appeared to be a reliable instrument among these youngsters, with only some scales falling (slightly) below the threshold of acceptable internal consistency. Girls (vs. boys) in Belgian/USA justice institutions and Swiss mixed welfare/justice institutions displayed higher scores for the angry-irritable, depressed-anxious, somatic complaints, suicide ideation scales. Also, detained girls from Belgium and Switzerland reported higher scores for traumatic experiences. No gender differences were revealed among adolescents in German welfare institutions. Our findings suggest that the MAYSI-2 may serve as a useful mental health screening instrument among youngsters in welfare/justice institutions and that girls in justice institutions and mixed welfare/justice institutions form a particularly vulnerable population with regard to mental health problems.

AB OBJECTIVE: Affected women and health professionals are still often unsure about how to react to exposures to potentially harmful agents during pregnancy. We wanted to find out which agents worry both pregnant women and professionals, under what circumstances the exposures take place, how they are currently dealt with and how serious they are.
   METHODS: Making use of the archives of Tox Info Suisse, the foundation that provides poisons information in Switzerland both for members of the general public and for healthcare professionals, we set up an analysis of exposures to possibly harmful agents during pregnancy. Queries during pregnancy between 1995 and 2015 were analysed. Demographic information, exposure and agent characteristics as well as - in a subgroup of cases - the corresponding treatments were considered in the present descriptive, retrospective analysis.
   RESULTS: Over the 21-year period, 2871 exposures during pregnancy were identified. The majority of the calls were made by members of the general public (2035, 70.9%; most often by the affected women themselves), followed by physicians (733, 25.5%). General public queries were mostly due to exposures connected with household chemicals (675/2035, 33.2%); those of physicians were most often due to medications (415/733, 56.6%). The majority of agent exposures occurred accidentally at home, at work, outdoors or at various other places (2297/2871, 80.0%). Less frequently, the exposures were intentional and had a suicidal, abusive, criminal or other character (471/2871, 16.4%). Of the 2871 calls, 905 cases with symptoms were recorded. Of the 1268 symptoms, 820 were mild (64.7%), 144 moderate (11.3%), 24 severe (1.9%, including 12 abortions) and 280 were not further specified (22.1%). In 1867 cases (65%), a total of 2331 measures were recommended by Tox Info Suisse, 1961 thereof to be carried out immediately. The two most common immediate measures were exposure interruption (412/1961, 21.0%) and forwarding to another institution (345/1961, 17.6%). In 70 cases, physicians' follow-up reports could be analysed; paracetamol was the agent most frequently involved (15 cases), followed by mefenamic acid (9) and the household product sodium hypochlorite (9).
   CONCLUSIONS: Tox Info Suisse recorded an average of 137 cases of agent exposure during pregnancy per year, mostly due to accidents with household products. Suicidal intentions played a role in a considerable number of exposures. Measures are needed to prevent accidental exposure of pregnant women to toxic substances and to support them in this exceptional life period.

AB Objectives Patients with advanced disease sometimes express a wish to hasten death (WTHD). In 2012, we published a systematic review and meta-ethnography of qualitative studies examining the experience and meaning of this phenomenon. Since then, new studies eligible for inclusion have been reported, including in Europe, a region not previously featured, and specifically in countries with different legal frameworks for euthanasia and assisted suicide. The aim of the present study was to update our previous review by including new research and to conduct a new analysis of available data on this topic.
   Setting Eligible studies originated from Australia, Canada, China, Germany, The Netherlands, Switzerland, Thailand and USA.
   Participants Studies of patients with life-threatening conditions that had expressed the WTHD.
   Design The search strategy combined subject terms with free-text searching of PubMed MEDLINE, Web of Science, CINAHL and PsycInfo. The qualitative synthesis followed the methodology described by Noblit and Hare, using the 'adding to and revising the original' model for updating a meta-ethnography, proposed by France et al. Quality assessment was done using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist.
   Results 14 studies involving 255 participants with life-threatening illnesses were identified. Five themes emerged from the analysis: suffering (overarching theme), reasons for and meanings and functions of the WTHD and the experience of a timeline towards dying and death. In the context of advanced disease, the WTHD emerges as a reaction to physical, psychological, social and existential suffering, all of which impacts on the patient's sense of self, of dignity and meaning in life.
   Conclusions The WTHD can hold different meanings for each individual-serving functions other than to communicate a genuine wish to die. Understanding the reasons for, and meanings and functions of, the WTHD is crucial for drawing up and implementing care plans to meet the needs of individual patients.

SO JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH; INDICATORS; SUICIDE; CONTEXT
AB Background Area-based measures of socioeconomic position (SEP) suitable for epidemiological research are lacking in Switzerland. The authors developed the Swiss neighbourhood index of SEP (Swiss-SEP).
   Methods Neighbourhoods of 50 households with overlapping boundaries were defined using Census 2000 and road network data. Median rent per square metre, proportion households headed by a person with primary education or less, proportion headed by a person in manual or unskilled occupation and the mean number of persons per room were analysed in principle component analysis. The authors compared the index with independent income data and examined associations with mortality from 2001 to 2008.
   Results 1.27 million overlapping neighbourhoods were defined. Education, occupation and housing variables had loadings of 0.578, 0.570 and 0.362, respectively, and median rent had a loading of -0.459. Mean yearly equivalised income of households increased from SFr42 000 to SFr72 000 between deciles of neighbourhoods with lowest and highest SEP. Comparing deciles of neighbourhoods with lowest to highest SEP, the age-and sex-adjusted HR was 1.38 (95% CI 1.36 to 1.41) for all-cause mortality, 1.83 (95% CI 1.71 to 1.95) for lung cancer, 1.48 (95% CI 1.44 to 1.51) for cardiovascular diseases, 2.42 (95% CI 1.94 to 3.01) for traffic accidents, 0.93 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.02) for breast cancer and 0.86 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.95) for suicide.
   Conclusions Developed using a novel approach to define neighbourhoods, the Swiss-SEP index was strongly associated with household income and some causes of death. It will be useful for clinical-and population-based studies, where individual-level socioeconomic data are often missing, and to investigate the effects on health of the socioeconomic characteristics of a place.

AB Background: Dying is inescapable yet remains a neglected issue in modern health care. The research question in this study was "what is going on in the field of dying today?" What emerged was to eventually present a grounded theory of control of dying focusing specifically on how people react in relation to issues about euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (PAS).
   Methods: Classic grounded theory was used to analyze interviews with 55 laypersons and health care professionals in North America and Europe, surveys on attitudes to PAS among physicians and the Swedish general public, and scientific literature, North American discussion forum websites, and news sites.
   Results: Open awareness of the nature and timing of a patient's death became common in health care during the 1960s in the Western world. Open dying awareness contexts can be seen as the start of a weakening of a taboo towards controlled dying called de-tabooing. The growth of the hospice movement and palliative care, but also the legalization of euthanasia and PAS in the Benelux countries, and PAS in Montana, Oregon and Washington further represents de-tabooing dying control. An attitude positioning between the taboo of dying control and a growing taboo against questioning patient autonomy and self-determination called de-paternalizing is another aspect of de-tabooing. When confronted with a taboo, people first react emotionally based on "gut feelings" - emotional positioning. This is followed by reasoning and label wrestling using euphemisms and dysphemisms - reflective positioning. Rarely is de-tabooing unconditional but enabled by stipulated positioning as in soft laws (palliative care guidelines) and hard laws (euthanasia/PAS legislation). From a global perspective three shapes of dying control emerge. First, suboptimal palliative care in closed awareness contexts seen in Asian, Islamic and Latin cultures, called closed dying. Second, palliative care and sedation therapy, but not euthanasia or PAS, is seen in Europe and North America, called open dying with reversible medical control. Third, palliative care, sedation therapy, and PAS or euthanasia occurs together in the Benelux countries, Oregon, Washington and Montana, called open dying with irreversible medical control.
   Conclusions: De-tabooing dying control is an assumed secular process starting with open awareness contexts of dying half a century ago, and continuing with the growth of the palliative care movement and later euthanasia and PAS legislation.

AB Rising numbers of ageing prisoners and goals on implementing equivalent health care in prison raise issues surrounding end-of-life care for prisoners. The paucity of research on this topic in Europe means that the needs of older prisoners contemplating death in prison have not been established. To investigate elderly prisoners' attitudes towards death and dying, 35 qualitative interviews with inmates aged 51 to 71 years were conducted in 12 Swiss prisons. About half of the prisoners reported having thought about dying in prison, with some mentioning it in relation with suicidal thoughts and others to disease and old age. Themes identified during data analysis included general thoughts about death and dying, accounts of other prisoners' deaths, availability of end-of-life services, contact with social relations, and wishes to die outside of prison. Study findings are discussed using Allmark's concept of "death without indignities," bringing forth two ethical issues: fostering autonomy and removing barriers. Attributing the identified themes to these two ethical actions clarifies the current needs of ageing prisoners in Switzerland and could be a first step towards the implementation of end-of-life services in correctional systems.

AB Background: Assisted dying and continuous deep sedation (CDS) are controversial practices. Little is known about the perceptions of physicians and surrogates about these practices for patients with advanced dementia. Objectives: To describe and compare physician and surrogate agreement with the use of assisted dying and CDS in advanced dementia. Design, Setting, Subjects: Physicians (n = 64) and surrogates (n = 168) of persons with advanced dementia were recruited as part of a randomized controlled trial in Switzerland that tested decision support tools in this population. Methods: At baseline, the participants were asked about their agreement with assisted dying and CDS in advanced dementia using the following response options: "completely agree," "somewhat agree," "somewhat disagree," "completely disagree," and "do not know." Multivariable logistic regressions compared the likelihood that surrogates versus physicians would completely or somewhat agree (vs. completely or somewhat disagree) with these practices. Results: The physicians and surrogates, respectively, had a mean age (SD) of 50.6 years (9.9) and 57.4 years (14.6); 46.9% (n = 30/64) and 68.9% (n = 115/167) were women. A total of 20.3% (n = 13/64) of the physicians and 47.0% (n = 79/168) of the surrogates agreed with assisted dying in advanced dementia. Surrogates were significantly more likely to agree with this practice than physicians (adjusted odds ratio, 3.87; 95% CI: 1.94, 7.69). With regard to CDS, 51.6% (n = 33/64) of the physicians and 41.9% (n = 70/169) of the surrogates agreed with this practice, which did not differ significantly between the groups. Conclusions: The surrogates were more agreeable to considering assisted dying in the setting of advanced dementia than the physicians, and about half of the participants in both groups reported CDS to be an appropriate option for this population.

AB Due to its chronic and fluctuating time course, multiple sclerosis (MS), thus far, has not been regarded as a focus of palliative care. However, sometimes we are confronted with severely affected MS patients, who suffer from complex medical, physical and psychosocial problems, which are not fully covered by the current health care services.
   We present two cases of severely affected MS patients we saw in our outpatient MS clinic, and who, we believe, are candidates for palliative care. The first patient, with primary chronic progressive (pcP) MS for many years (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). 8.0) presented with complex painful dysaesthesias and a depressive syndrome. He refused any treatment, and finally committed suicide with the help of a euthanasia group in Switzerland. The second patient was also severely affected by a secondary chronic progressive (scP) MS (EDSS: 9.0) and was finally admitted to our palliative care unit due to a complex pain syndrome associated with panic attacks and anxiety. She spent three weeks on the palliative care unit and her symptoms improved gradually after changing and optimising her pain medication. The patient was discharged with home care and is seen regularly on the palliative care unit.
   Additionally, as a first step, a questionnaire was sent to 53 German MS specialists regarding their general view on the needs for palliative care in MS. Our two cases and the results of the questionnaire demonstrated that MS patients and their caregivers are confronted with a variety of symptoms which are difficult to treat, and are a cause of great suffering for the patients, including ataxia, depression and fatigue. The data of the questionnaire also showed that neurologists usually do not deal with end-of-life care issues in MS.
   More research is needed to define the role of palliative care in MS and establish appropriate interventions to improve the quality of life in advanced stage MS patients and their relatives.

AB Background. Intoxication, whether from alcohol, drugs, or alcohol and drugs in combination, remains a challenging burden on emergency departments. The increasing alcohol consumption among adolescents and young adults, particularly heavy episodic drinking, and the resulting increase in the use of health care resources for alcohol intoxication has been a widely discussed topic. Objective. The aim of our study was to assess and characterize the use of emergency ambulance services that was required as a result of alcohol and drug intoxication in a major metropolitan area. Methods. We conducted a retrospective, longitudinal study over a 10-year period in the greater metropolitan area of Zurich, Switzerland. The study population included intoxicated patients assessed and initially treated by paramedics of the emergency ambulance service. Data were extracted from the ambulance service reports. The primary outcomes measured were trends over time in the numbers and types of intoxication and trends with respect to gender and age distributions of intoxicated patients. Results. An annual increase of about 5% in the number of intoxicated patients requiring emergency ambulance service was observed over the study period. Alcohol use was present in 73% of the cases. The highest number of cases was among patients 25-44 years of age. The greatest increase in the number of cases over time was among patients under 25 years of age. Women comprised 41% of the patients under 25 years of age but only about 35% of older patients. The number of severe injuries and suicide attempts was small, but the number of suicide attempts increased at a higher rate than the overall number of cases of intoxication. There was a significant increase (17.64% per year on average) in the incidence of aggressive behavior toward paramedics from intoxicated patients, although still small in numbers. Conclusions. Our findings suggest two main vulnerable groups: young persons under 25 years of age, with a particular focus on women, having the greatest increase over time, and middle-aged men, having the greatest proportion among all cases observed. Intervention efforts should include a high-risk approach to reduce alcohol-related problems.

AB Continuous deep sedation (CDS) is sometimes used to treat refractory symptoms in terminally ill patients. The aim of this paper was to estimate the frequency and characteristics of CDS in six European countries: Belgium, Denmark, Italy, The Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland. Deaths reported to death registries were sampled and the reporting doctors received a mailed questionnaire about the medical decision making that preceded the death of the patient. The total number of deaths studied was 20,480. The response rate ranged between 44 % (Italy) and 75 % (The Netherlands). Of all deaths, CDS was applied in 2.5 % in Denmark and up to 8.5 % in Italy. Of all patients receiving CDS, 35 % (Italy) and up to 64 % (Denmark and The Netherlands) did not receive artificial nutrition or hydration. Patients who received CDS were more often male, younger than 80 years old, more likely to have had cancer, and died more often in a hospital compared to nonsudden deaths without CDS. The high variability of frequency and characteristics of CDS in the studied European countries points out the importance of medical education and scientific debate on this issue.

AB Background: Requests for physician-assisted death (PAD) in patients with cognitive impairment are complex and require careful consideration. Of particular difficulty is determination of whether the request is voluntary and well considered. Results: Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) are both legal in The Netherlands, Luxemburg, Colombia, and Canada. Euthanasia is legal in Belgium, while PAS is legal in Switzerland and Oregon, Washington, Montana, Vermont, and California (USA). Upon a PAD request, evaluation of the capacity to consent medical treatment is relevant for the decision-making process, while evaluation of testamentary capacity is appropriate before an advance euthanasia directive is written. Anosognosia assessment throughout the Alzheimer's disease continuum provides essential and relevant information regarding the voluntary and well-considered nature of the PAD request; meanwhile, early assessment of hypernosognosia or subjective cognitive decline assists in formulation of a clinical prognosis. Furthermore, the assessment of physical and psychological suffering should incorporate verbal and nonverbal cues as well as consideration of the psychosocial factors that might affect due care criteria. Conclusion: The clinical approach to a PAD request should consider the legal framework and the decision-making capacity, assess memory deficit awareness and the perception of suffering, and evaluate mental competency when considered pertinent.

SO MEDICAL JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA

DT Article
AB Objective: To highlight recent reductions in mortality rates in Australia and identify conditions and population groups with the greatest potential for further reduction in mortality rates.
   Design: International benchmarking and intranational comparisons of mortality rates were used to identify areas with the greatest potential for improvement.
   Results: Latest data from Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries confirm that, while Japan's death rates remain the lowest in the world, Australia's are decreasing rapidly and we now rival Switzerland for second overall ranking. When the contributions of specific conditions are compared, the areas with the greatest potential for reductions are circulatory diseases (especially ischaemic heart disease); suicide; injury and violence; smoking-related conditions; and cancers amenable to prevention/early detection. Intranational comparisons show considerable scope for reduction in inequalities, especially those between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and other Australians, between males and females, and between low and high socioeconomic groups. These conditions and inequalities are highly interrelated, as differentials in health status are often mediated through broader societal inequalities.
   Conclusions: Australia should aim to become the country with the lowest mortality rate in the world. This could realistically be achieved by benchmarking performance nationally and internationally, applying current knowledge and available interventions, matching policies with funding, and implementing systemic national programs and activities to promote health and prevent "illth".

AB Objectives. - In Switzerland, adolescents are responsible for many crimes. In 2014, almost 13,000 juvenile offenders were convicted by the courts (mainly convicted under the Swiss Criminal Code and Narcotics Act Consumption). Although a decrease trend was observed for 2008, these delinquent behaviors remain a concern for public health, politics and educational authorities. In addition to repressive measures, the implementation of an effective and appropriate treatment program appears necessary. Indeed, the admission to an educational center is a "time-window" useful to establish short and specific interventions (rehabilitation programs, psychological treatment and educational measures). In order to propose interventions and appropriate educational measures, it is essential to know the situation of juvenile offenders. The aim of the present study is to describe adolescents admitted in an educational center for youth delinquents. The study highlighted gender-specific differences in sociodemographic data and psychiatric disorders.
   Methods. - The sample is composed of 43 delinquent adolescents with 32.6% of girls and 67.4% of boys. During a structured interview, each youth answered about social-economic, and sociodemographic questions. Psychiatric disorders were assessed with the French version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children Present and Lifetime version (K-SAD-PL).
   Results. - The results indicated that almost two-third of youths (61%) had dropped out of school. Additionally, results revealed that there are not gender differences in sociodemographic data. Furthermore, whereas girls presented a mix of internalizing and externalizing psychiatric disorders, boys where more exclusively externalizing psychiatric disorders. More specifically, girls showed a significantly higher level of anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder than boys. Girls showed a higher risk for suicide. In contrast, boys used more illegal substances than girls (mostly cannabis). Overall, in 40% of adolescents, illegal substances use started before the age of 14 years.
   Conclusion. - This study highlighted gender differences in psychiatric disorders related to delinquent behaviors. Indeed, girls showed more complex psychiatric disorders than boys. Thus, a therapeutic program should target gender-specific needs of young offenders, focusing on the most relevant aspects of psychiatric disorder such as internalizing problems in girls.

AB Background: Generational differences in disease rates are the main subject of age-period-cohort (APC) analysis, which is mostly applied in cancer and suicide research. This study applied APC analysis to selected neurological diseases: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Methods: The analyses were based on Swiss mortality data. Age-stratified data has been available for MS, PD and ALS since 1901, 1921, and 1942, respectively. APC analysis was performed within the framework of logit models. Main effect models were extended by implementing nested effects, i.e. age effects nested in sub-periods, in order to account for the fact that age profiles may change for reasons other than generational influences. Results: In preliminary analyses, APC analysis yielded noteworthy birth cohort effects in all three diseases. After implementing nested effects, the birth cohort effects disappeared in ALS, and smoothed out in PD, where they were greater for the generations born before the 1920s. In MS, the birth cohort effects remained stable, and exhibited a peak in cohorts born in the 1910s and 1920s. Conclusions: APC analysis yielded some evidence for birth cohort effects, i.e. predisposing risk factors that may change in historical terms, in MS and PD, but probably not in ALS.

AB Social and economic policies are inextricably linked with population health outcomes in Europe, yet few datasets are able to fully explore and compare this relationship across European countries. The European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) survey aims to address this gap using microdata on income, living conditions and health. EU-SILC contains both cross-sectional and longitudinal elements, with nationally representative samples of individuals 16 years and older in 28 European Union member states as well as Iceland, Norway and Switzerland. Data collection began in 2003 in Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Greece, Luxembourg and Austria, with subsequent expansion across Europe. By 2011, all 28 EU member states, plus three others, were included in the dataset. Although EU-SILC is administered by Eurostat, the data are output-harmonized so that countries are required to collect specified data items but are free to determine sampling strategies for data collection purposes. EU-SILC covers approximately 500 000 European residents for its cross-sectional survey annually. Whereas aggregated data from EU-SILC are publicly available [http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/income-and-living-conditions/data/main-tables], microdata are only available to research organizations subject to approval by Eurostat.

AB The Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) is a prospective cohort study of HIV-infected adolescents and adults seen at 7 outpatient clinics (Swiss University Hospitals in Basle, Berne, Geneva, Lausanne, Zurich, the St. Gall Cantonal Hospital and the Civico Hospital in Lugano). The SHCS serves as an infrastructure for different research projects and includes about 70% of all patients with advanced disease in Switzerland. From April 1984 to November 1995 3120 HIV-infected patients of the SHCS died. Autopsies were performed in 314 of these patients. The aim of our study is to analyse autopsy findings as well as causes of death in those 314 HIV-infected patients.
   An HIV-related cause of death was found in 271 (86%) of the patients, 12 patients (4%) died of a drug overdose, and 3 (1%) of the patients committed suicide. 28 (9%) died either from an HIV-unrelared or unidentified cause. The five most frequent causes of death were: bacterial pneumonia (52 patients, 17%), Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (40 patients, 13%), lymphoma (34 patients, 11%), cytomegalovirus infection (33 patients, 11%), and toxoplasmosis (30 patients, 10%).
   During our study marked progress occurred in treating HIV-infected patients and preventing opportunistic infections. These improvements have further changed the natural course of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. They are reflected in the falling rare of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and toxoplasmosis, as well as an increase in lymphoma as a cause of death over the period of our study.

AB Background: In this study we investigated (a) to what extent physicians have experience with performing a range of end-of-life decisions (ELDs), (b) if they have no experience with performing an ELD, would they be willing to do so under certain conditions and (c) which background characteristics are associated with having experience with/or being willing to make such ELDs.
   Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was sent to 16,486 physicians from specialities in which death is common: Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland.
   Results: The response rate differed between countries (39-68%). The experience of foregoing life-sustaining treatment ranged between 37% and 86%: intensifying the alleviation of pain or other symptoms while taking into account possible hastening of death between 57% and 95%, and experience with deep sedation until death between 12% and 46%. Receiving a request for hastening death differed between 34% and 71%, and intentionally hastening death on the explicit request of a patient between 1% and 56%.
   Conclusion: There are differences between countries in experiences with ELDs, in willingness to perform ELDs and in receiving requests for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. Foregoing treatment and intensifying alleviation of pain and symptoms are practiced and accepted by most physicians in all countries. Physicians with training in palliative care are more inclined to perform ELDs, as are those who attend to higher numbers of terminal patients. Thus, this seems not to be only a matter of opportunity, but also a matter of attitude.

AB INTRODUCTION: In general practice, the diagnosis of dementia is often delayed. Therefore, the Swiss National Dementia Strategy 2014 concluded that action was needed to improve patient care. Little is known about GPs' confidence in and approach to the diagnosis, disclosure and post-diagnostic management of individuals with dementia in Switzerland. The aim of this survey is to assess these elements of dementia care and GPs' views on the adequacy of health care services regarding dementia.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional postal survey in Switzerland in 2017 supported by all academic institutes of general practice in Swiss universities. Members of the Swiss Association of General Practitioners (n = 4460) were asked to participate in the survey. In addition to the GPs' demographic characteristics, the survey addressed the following issues GPs' views on the adequacy of health care services, clinical approach and confidence in the management of dementia.
   RESULTS: The survey response rate was 21%. The majority of GPs (64%) felt confident diagnosing dementia, but not in patients with a migration background (15%). For neuropsychological testing, three-quarters of GPs collaborated with memory clinics and were satisfied with the access to diagnostic services. At the time of first diagnosis, 62% of GPs diagnosed the majority of their patients with a mild stage of dementia, and 31% with a mild cognitive impairment. The most frequent actions taken by GPs after the diagnosis of mild dementia were giving advice to relatives (71%), testing fitness-to-drive (66%) and minimising cardiovascular risk factors (63%). While 65% of GPs felt confident taking care of patients with dementia, fewer (53%) felt confident in pharmacological treatment, coping with suicidal ideation (44%) or caring for patients with a migration background (16%). Half of GPs preferred to delegate the assessment of fitness-to-drive to an official authority. One in four GPs was not satisfied with the local provision of care and support facilities for patients with dementia.
   CONCLUSIONS: Overall, GPs reported confidence in establishing a diagnosis of dementia and sufficient access to diagnostic services. Post-diagnostic management primarily focused on counselling and harm reduction rather than pharmacological treatment. Future educational support for GPs should be developed, concentrating on coping with their patients' suicidal ideation and caring for patients with a migration background.

AB Background: Chronically ill persons experience conditions of life that can become unbearable, resulting in the wish to end their life prematurely. Relatives confronted with this wish experience ambivalence between loyalty to the person's desire to die and the fear of losing this person. Caring for a person during the premature dying process can be morally challenging for nurses. One way to end one's life prematurely is Voluntary Stopping of Eating and Drinking (VSED).
   Methods: This embedded single case study explored the experiences of registered nurses (embedded units of analysis: ward manager, nursing manager, nursing expert) and relatives who accompanied a 49-year-old woman suffering from multiple sclerosis during VSED in a Swiss long-term care institution (main unit of analysis). By means of a within-analysis, we performed an in-depth analysis of every embedded unit of analysis and elaborated a central phenomenon for each unit. Afterwards, we searched for common patterns in a cross-analysis of the embedded units of analysis in order to develop a central model.
   Results: The following central concept emerged from cross-analysis of the embedded units of analysis: As a way of ending one's life prematurely, VSED represents an unfamiliar challenge to nurses and relatives in the field of tension between one's personal attitude and the agents' concerns, fears and uncertainties. Particularly significant is the personal attitude, influenced on the one hand by one's own experiences, prior knowledge, role and faith, on the other hand by the VSED-performing person's age, disease and deliberate communication of the decision. Depending on the intention of VSED as either suicide or natural dying, an accepting or dismissing attitude evolves on an institutional and personal level.
   Conclusions: To deal professionally with VSED in an institution, it is necessary to develop an attitude on the institutional and personal level. Educational measures and quality controls are required to ensure that VSED systematically becomes an option to hasten death. As VSED is a complex phenomenon, it is necessary to include palliative care in practice development early on and comprehensively. There is a high need of further research on this topic. Particularly, qualitative studies and hypothesis-testing approaches are required.

AB ObjectiveThe road to legalization of Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID) across Canada has largely focused on legislative details such as eligibility and establishment of regulatory clinical practice standards. Details on how to implement high-quality, person-centered MAID programs at the institutional level are lacking. This study seeks to understand what improvement opportunities exist in the delivery of the MAID process from the family caregiver perspective.MethodThis multi-methods study design used structured surveys, focus groups, and unstructured e-mail/phone conversations to gather experiential feedback from family caregivers of patients who underwent MAID between July 2016 and June 2017 at a large academic hospital in Toronto, Canada. Data were combined and a qualitative, descriptive approach used to derive themes within family perspectives.ResultImprovement themes identified through the narrative data (48% response rate) were grouped in two categories: operational and experiential aspects of MAID. Operational themes included: process clarity, scheduling challenges and the 10-day period of reflection. Experiential themes included clinician objection/judgment, patient and family privacy, and bereavement resources.Significance of resultsTo our knowledge, this is the first time that family caregivers' perspectives on the quality of the MAID process have been explored. Although practice standards have been made available to ensure all legislated components of the MAID process are completed, detailed guidance for how to best implement patient and family centered MAID programs at the institutional level remain limited. This study provides guidance for ways in which we can enhance the quality of MAID from the perspective of family caregivers.

AB Mortality for people living with HIV (PLWH) has dramatically decreased since the mid-1990s and the proportion of deaths attributable to non-AIDS-related conditions has increased. Deceased PLWH were identified from a single academic medical center through provider survey and electronic medical record query. Cause of death was determined using the Coding Causes of Death in HIV tool following review of available medical records. Chart review of comorbidities, demographics, laboratory values, and previous completion of screening tests for malignancies was conducted for deaths during the period of 2013-2017. The proportion of AIDS-related deaths decreased markedly between 1995 and 2017, while the proportion of deaths from non-AIDS malignancies increased. From 2013 to 2017, 30 of 121 deaths were attributed to AIDS-related conditions, 32 to non-AIDS malignancies, 14 to suicide/homicide or sudden death, 10 to cardiac causes, 28 to other non-HIV causes, and 7 to unknown causes. Those who died of non-AIDS-related malignancies were older than AIDS-related deaths [mean age 55.8 (7.6) vs. 47.3 (13.5), p value = .003]. Less than half of potentially eligible patients had documented colon cancer screening. The number of individuals dying from AIDS-related conditions has decreased significantly and non-AIDS-related causes, particularly non-AIDS-related malignancies, have become more prominent causes of death. As our patients age, a greater focus needs to be placed on management of comorbid illnesses and screening and prevention of malignancy.

AB Introduction: Methylphenidate is a piperidine derivative structurally and pharmacologically similar to amphetamine. Methylphenidate is indicated for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children aged 6 years of age and over when remedial measures alone prove insufficient. In adults, its indication, except in narcolepsy, is not defined. Methylphenidate received regulatory approval almost sixty years ago with a first registration in Switzerland in October 1954.
   Objective: To evaluate the off-label use of methylphenidate and its characteristics from a database of spontaneous reports.
   Methods: This study analysed data from the French Pharmacovigilance Database of adverse drug reactions spontaneously reported by health professionals from 1985 to December 2011. Off-label use was evaluated according to age.
   Results: In the French Pharmacovigilance database, 181 cases of adverse drug reactions were reported with methylphenidate. Neuropsychiatric effects were the most frequent adverse event reported (41%) followed by cardiovascular and cutaneous side effects (14%). 143 reports concerned children (113 boys, 30 girls, mean age 10.6 +/- 3.3 years) of which 46 (30%) were off-label uses. There were 38 adults (20 men, 18 women), of which 32 (88%) off-label use. In adults, methylphenidate was prescribed for depression, and this practice was associated with serious adverse events of drug dependence, overdose and suicide attempt. Overall, off-label use was detected in 43% (78/181) of all cases reported.
   Conclusion: More than 40% of the patients with drug reactions received methylphenidate for off-label indications. Additional long-term exposures and independent clinical studies are necessary to establish the long-term profile safety of methylphenidate.

AB Background - Migration during the 1990s has been high and has been characterised by new migrations. Migration has been a key force in the demographic changes of the European population. Due to the different condition of migration in Europe, variables related to mental health of migrants are: motivation for migration, living conditions in the home and in the host country.
   Aims - To give an overview on (i) prevalence of mental disorders; suicide; alcohol and drug abuse; (ii) access to mental health and psychosocial care facilities of migrants in the European region, and (iii) utilisation of health and psychosocial institution of these migrants.
   Methods - Non-system review of the literature concerning mental health disorders of migrants and their access to and their consumption of health care and psychosocial services in Europe.
   Results - It is impossible to consider "migrants" as a homogeneous group concerning the risk for mental illness. The literature showed (i) mental health differs between migrant groups, (ii) access to psychosocial care facilities is influenced by the legal frame of the host country: (iii) mental health and consumption of care facilities is shaped by migrants used patterns of help-seeking and by the legal frame of the host country.
   Conclusion - Data on migrant's mental health is scarce. Longitudinal studies are needed to describe mental health adjusting for life conditions in Europe to identify those factors which imply an increased risk of psychiatric disorders and influence help seeking for psychosocial care. In many European countries migrants fall outside the existing health and social services, particularly asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants. (C)2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Psychiatric inpatient treatment is increasingly performed in settings with locked doors. However, locked wards have well-known disadvantages and are ethically problematic. In addition, recent data challenges the hypothesis that locked wards provide improved safety over open-door settings regarding suicide, absconding and aggression. Furthermore, there is evidence that the introduction of an open-door policymay lead to short-term reductions in involuntary measures. The aim of this study was to assess if the introduction of an open-door policy is associated with a long-term reduction of the frequency of seclusion and forced medication.
   Method: In this 6-year, hospital-wide, longitudinal, observational study, we examined the frequency of seclusion and forced medication in 17,359 inpatient cases admitted to the Department of Adult Psychiatry, Universitare Psychiatrische Kliniken (UPK) Basel, University of Basel, Switzerland. In an approach to enable a less restrictive policy, six previously closed psychiatric wards were permanently opened beginning from August 2011. During this process, a systematic change towards a more patient-centered and recovery-oriented care was applied. Statistical analysis consisted of generalized estimating equations (GEE) models.
   Results: In multivariate analyses controlling for potential confounders, the implementation of an open-door policy was associated with a continuous reduction of seclusion (from 8.2 to 3.5%; eta(2)(p)=0.82; odds ratio: 0.88) and forced medication (from 2.4 to 1.2%; eta(2)(p)=0.70; odds ratio: 0.90).
   Conclusion: This underlines the potential of the introduction of an open-door policy to attain a long-term reduction in involuntary measures. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Uncertainty is often deemed to be a quintessential fact of life. The social scientific literature often references a generalised or 'global' uncertainty, akin to a worldview. Far fewer studies, however, discuss the specific effects of 'event' focused uncertainty: how it is managed by groups and individuals, or how this type of uncertainy relates to the concepts of risk, trust, hope and time. This article seeks to identity and analyse key aspects of the condition of uncertainty through an empirical exploration of two very different case studies. asylum applications waiting for the state to decide whether to grant them the right to remain in the UK, and people with chronic or life-limiting illness who want to hasten their own death with the help of a Swiss right-to-die organistaion. In both cases, participants experienced a heightened state of uncertainty because of specific and substantial threats to their well-being: deportaion, and protracted suffering through illness in both cases, the acquistion of knowledge was considered to aid predictions about future events. However, both sets of individuals encountered barriers to acquiring the right kind of knowledge - knowledge which was trusted to be accurate or which came with a guarantee. While all the individuals were constrained in their ability to act to relieve their uncertainty, they found limited ways of doing so, knowledge and action are therby found to be crucial to the conditon of uncertainty and to the means of overcoming it through restoring a sense of control

AB Background: The PRISM-S task was developed at the Crisis Intervention Center (KIZ) Winterthur, Switzerland, to enable an assessment of the degree of suicidality in less than 5 minutes with a simple, visual instrument. Aims: Comparison of validity and clinical use of the new PRISM-S task with other instruments known as "gold standards". Method: Quantitative pilot study enlisting 100 inpatients admitted to the KIZ, aged 15-42 years. Patients' suicidality was assessed by the PRISM-S task during the first clinical interview and compared to data obtained by standardized suicidality instruments. Results: The patients completed the PRISM-S task in 2 to 5 minutes without difficulty. Data show significant positive correlations between the suicidality as assessed by PRISM-S and the gold standards, i.e., DSI-SS (r = 0.59, N = 65, p < .0001). Limitations: There is no strong evidence that PRISM-S is useful for outpatients or in other settings. The experiences gained with outpatients/patients with other disorders are promising but have not been systematically evaluated. The results do not rely on a randomized design. The sample consists of persons coming to the crisis intervention center. Conclusions: PRISM-S offers a brief, easy-to-administer, and valid method to assess patients' suicidality. The simple instruction facilitates its use in other languages and other cultures as well. The acceptance by patients and health professionals was good, with no one refusing to complete the task.

AB Several criteria (frequency, hazardous use, drunkenness) were used to delineate four distinct groups and to analyse the relations between patterns of alcohol use and other health variables. In the 1993 Swiss Multicentre Adolescent Survey on Health, anonymous self-administered questionnaires were distributed to a national representative sample of in-school 15 to 20-year-old adolescents. Of the respondents, 25% answered a module targeting alcohol use (n = 2359) of whom 13% were totally abstinent, 55.1% were moderate drinkers (less than or equal to 1 drink/week and <3 times drunk), 21.7% were 'social' drinkers (>3 times drunk and < twice driven when drunk) and 10.2% were 'problem drinkers' (> twice driven whilst drunk or >1 drink/day). Differences between problem drinkers and the rest of the sample showed the former as being predominantly boys with an odds ratio (OR) of 6.3, having a higher lifetime prevalence rate of cannabis use (OR = 3.4), never using seat belts (OR = 2.5), having their family/peers more often involved in alcohol consumption (OR = 1.9), being predominantly apprentices (against high school pupils OR = 1.9), having cheated during courses (OR = 1.9), being a member of a gang (OR = 1.7), having stolen in a public area (OR = 1.7) and having considered suicide (OR = 1.8).
   Conclusion Within the Swiss context, whereas moderate/occasional use of alcohol must be considered as part of an adolescents' development, regular use of alcohol, often associated with drunkenness and driving while drunk, is associated with various health hazards and problems. Preventive strategies should be built accordingly.

AB In the last decade, the number of patients continuously deeply sedated until death increased up to fourfold. The reasons for this increase remain unclear.
   To identify socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of sedated patients, and concurrent possibly life-shortening medical end-of-life decisions.
   Cross-sectional death certificate study in German-speaking Switzerland in 2001 and 2013.
   Non-sudden and expected deaths (2001: N = 2281, 2013: N = 2256) based on a random sample of death certificates and followed by an anonymous survey on end-of-life practices among attending physicians.
   Physicians' reported proportion of patients continuously deeply sedated until death, socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, and possibly life-shortening medical end-of life decisions.
   In 2013, physicians sedated four times more patients continuously until death (6.7% in 2001; 24.5.5% in 2013). Four out of five sedated patients died in hospitals, outside specialized palliative care units, or in nursing homes. Sedation was more likely among patients younger than 65 (odds ratio 2.24, 95% CI 1.6 to 3.2) and those dying in specialized palliative care (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.3 to 3.8) or in hospitals (1.7, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.3). Forgoing life-prolonging treatment with the explicit intention to hasten or not to postpone death combined with intensified alleviation of symptoms was very strongly associated with continuous deep sedation (OR 6.8, 95% CI 4.7 to 9.8).
   In Swiss clinical practice, continuously deeply sedated patients predominantly died outside specialized palliative care. The increasing trend over time appears to be related to changes in medical end-of-life practice rather than to patient's clinical characteristics.

AB In many European countries, the last decade has been marked by an increasing debate about the acceptability and regulation'of euthanasia and other end-of-life decisions in medical practice. Growing public sensibility to a 'right to die' for terminally ill patients has been one of the main constituents of these debates.

We used the European Values Study data of 1999-2000 with a total of 41 125 respondents (63% response rate) in 33 European countries. The main outcome measure concerned the acceptance of euthanasia (defined as 'terminating the life of the incurably sick', rated on a scale from I to 10).
   Results showed that the acceptance of euthanasia tended to be high in some Countries (e.g. the Netherlands, Denmark, France, Sweden), while a markedly low acceptance was found in others (e.g. Romania. Malta and Turkey). A multivariate ordinal regression showed that weaker religious belief was the most important factor associated with a higher acceptance: however, there were also socio-demographic differences: younger cohorts. people from non-manual social classes, and people with a higher educational level tended to have a higher acceptance of euthanasia. While religious belief. sociodemographic factors, and also moral values (i.e. the belief in the right to self-determination) could largely explain the differences between countries, our findings suggest that perceptions regarding euthanasia are probably also influenced by national traditions and history (e.g. Germany). Thus, we demonstrated clear cross-national differences with regard to the acceptance of euthanasia, which can serve as an important basis for further debate and research in the specific countries.

AB Background We compared mortality inequalities by occupational class in Japan and South Korea with those in European countries, in order to determine whether patterns are similar. Methods National register-based data from Japan, South Korea and eight European countries (Finland, Denmark, England/Wales, France, Switzerland, Italy (Turin), Estonia, Lithuania) covering the period between 1990 and 2015 were collected and harmonised. We calculated age-standardised all-cause and cause-specific mortality among men aged 35-64 by occupational class and measured the magnitude of inequality with rate differences, rate ratios and the average inter-group difference. Results Clear gradients in mortality were found in all European countries throughout the study period: manual workers had 1.6-2.5 times higher mortality than upper non-manual workers. However, in the most recent time-period, upper non-manual workers had higher mortality than manual workers in Japan and South Korea. This pattern emerged as a result of a rise in mortality among the upper non-manual group in Japan during the late 1990s, and in South Korea during the late 2000s, due to rising mortality from cancer and external causes (including suicide), in addition to strong mortality declines among lower non-manual and manual workers. Conclusion Patterns of mortality by occupational class are remarkably different between European countries and Japan and South Korea. The recently observed patterns in the latter two countries may be related to a larger impact on the higher occupational classes of the economic crisis of the late 1990s and the late 2000s, respectively, and show that a high socioeconomic position does not guarantee better health.

AB Background: Gay men are at higher risk of suffering from a variety of psychiatric disorders, yet the mental health literacy of this population has remained largely unknown.
   Methods: In 2007 and 2011, surveys were conducted among gay men in Geneva, Switzerland, recruited by probability-based time-space sampling. Based on a case vignette of a man with major depression, respondents were asked a series of questions about labelling, perceived risk, and help-seeking beliefs. Men meeting caseness for major depression were asked open questions about perceived causes and additional help-seeking/self-help.
   Results: Among the 762 respondents, 14.7% met diagnostic criteria for major depression (MDD) in the past 12 months. The vignette was labelled depression by 44.1% of the entire sample, and 61.9% of the men with MDD. Discrimination (33 2%), acceptance or rejection by others (21.4%), and loneliness (24.9%) were the most common reasons given for greater susceptibility among gay men, yet men with MDD reported problems with love/relationship (32.5%,) and work (28.9%) as the most common perceived causes of recent depression, and problems with love/relationship (21.9%), accepting one's homosexuality (21.1%), and family (20.2%) at initial outset. The highest proportions of gay men rated non-medical options such as a close friend (91.6%), relaxation exercises or meditation (84.4%), and physical activity (83.5%) as being helpful for the depression vignette.
   Limitations: No probes used for open questions, and findings generalizable only to gay men in the sampling scheme.
   Conclusions: There are many commonalities in labelling, perceived causes, and help-seeking with general populations, but also numerous specificities in mental health literacy and experience among gay men. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB During the last years many studies about prevalence rates in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) have been published. From Switzerland, however, there were no reliable data about the frequency of NSSI in adolescents till now. In consideration of the many studies that were concerned about NSSI in adolescents it has to be pointed out critically that most of them just reported the data but rarely gave any further descriptions about the groups of self-injurers and therefore these studies were unable to advise on effective prevention or intervention. In the context of an epidemiological study about NSSI in the Kanton Basel-Stadt, 447 pupils (M = 14.95 years, SD = 0.74, 52 % male) from various educational settings were assessed using several questionnaires. Despite the manner and form of the NSSI, the mental burden has been examined and it has been explored how many of the non-suicidal self-injurers described themselves as mentally burdened. The Modified Ottawa Ulm Self Injury Inventory MOUSI was used to assess NSSI symptomatology and the German Version of the Reynolds Adolescent Adjustment Screening Inventory (RAASI) for mental health screening. Of all the students, 61 (13.6 %) harmed themselves at least once, 29 (6.4 %) harmed themselves in the last month, and 4 of them four times or more. The results confirm the high prevalence rates of NSSI found in other studies. In the context of identification and prevention items about NSSI should be integrated in psychopathological screening-questionnaires to adequately show the burden of these adolescents. These results and the high prevalence show that different subgroups of adolescents with NSSI exist who require help that exactly fits their symptoms.

AB Although it has been shown that anxiety disorders (AD) are often found in children and juveniles with a disruptive behavior disorder (DBD; i.e., conduct disorder [CD] and oppositional defiant disorder [ODD]), research in this field is limited. The few papers that addressed this topic found indications for both positive and negative effects of AD on the course and treatment of DBD. The objective of the current study was to examine mental health problems, traumatic experiences, psychopathic traits, and offending behavior in juveniles and emerging adults with DBD with AD compared with those without AD. The total sample contained 207 children, adolescents, and emerging adults (age 9-25, 73.4% males) with DBD with AD (N = 27) and with DBDwithout AD (N= 180) in residential youth care institutions in Switzerland between 2007 and 2011. Half of the sample was placed under civil law (50.5%), 37.8% under penal law, and 11.7% for other reasons (e.g., voluntarily). Psychopathologywas examined with the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL), a semistructured interview for mental disorders. In addition, mental health problems were assessed using the Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument-second version (MAYSI-2), traumatic experiences with the Essener Trauma-Inventar (ETI), and psychopathic traits using the Youth Psychopathic Traits Inventory (YPI). Finally, conviction rateswere requested at the Federal Statistical Office. Results showed that the group with DBD and AD comprised significantly more female subjects than did the DBDwithout AD group, 48.1% vs. 77.2%;.2(1, N = 207) = 10.17, p < 0.01. Both groups did not differ on age, time of measure, drop-out, or previous placements. Furthermore, the DBD with AD group had significantly less additional externalizing disorders than the group without AD, 11.1% vs. 38.3%;.2(1, N= 207) = 7.67, p < 0.01. No significant differences between both groups were found for internalizing disorders or substance use disorders. The DBD with AD group, however, reported significantly more depressed-anxious problems, t (231) = -2.19, p =.030, somatic complaints t(231) = -3.34, p = .001, and suicide ideation, t(231) = -2.13, p = .034, as well as more traumatic experiences, 100.0% vs. 83.0%;chi 2(1, N = 207) = 4.39, p = 0.04, than did the DBD groupwithout AD. Finally, no differences were found between the two groups for psychopathic traits and both conviction and reconviction rates. The results of the current study demonstrate that although the group of juveniles with DBD and AD in residential youth care institutions in Switzerland is burdened differently than those juveniles with DBD without AD (fewer externalizing problems, more traumatic experiences, more internalizing problems), they are not at increased or decreased risk for being convicted or reconvicted. More longitudinal research, however, is needed to understand the relationship between DBD and comorbid AD.

AB Background: The number of older prisoners entering and ageing in prison has increased in the last few decades. Ageing prisoners pose unique challenges to the prison administration as they have differentiated social, custodial and healthcare needs than prisoners who are younger and relatively healthier. Objective: The goal of this study was to explore and compare the somatic disease burden of old and young prisoners, and to examine whether it can be explained by age group and/or time served in prison. Methods: Access to prisoner medical records was granted to extract disease and demographic information of older (>50 years) and younger (<= 49 years) prisoners in different Swiss prisons. Predictor variables included the age group and the time spent in prison. The dependent variable was the total number of somatic diseases as reported in the medical records. Results were analysed using descriptive statistics and a negative binomial model. Results: Data of 380 male prisoners from 13 different prisons in Switzerland reveal that the mean ages of older and younger prisoners were 58.78 and 34.26 years, respectively. On average, older prisoners have lived in prison for 5.17 years and younger prisoners for 2.49 years. The average total number of somatic diseases reported by older prisoners was 2.26 times higher than that of prisoners below 50 years of age (95% CI 1.77-2.87, p < 0.001). Conclusion: This study is the first of its kind to capture national disease data of prisoners with a goal of comparing the disease burden of older and younger prisoners. Study findings indicate that older inmates suffer from more somatic diseases and that the number of diseases increases with age group. Results clearly illustrate the poorer health conditions of those who are older, their higher healthcare burden, and raises questions related to the provision of healthcare for inmates growing old in prison.

AB Study objectives: Associations between sleep problems and suicidality are increasingly acknowledged, but prospective data from well-controlled long-term community studies are lacking.
   Methods: We analyzed data from a longitudinal cohort study with n = 591 young adults from Zurich, Switzerland, prospectively followed from 1979 (age 20/21 years) to 2008 (age 49/50 years). Twelve-month prevalence of various mental disorders, socio-environmental confounders and sleep problems were carefully assessed with semi-structured interviews at 7 assessment waves spanning overall a 30-year observation period. Interviews were conducted with the "Structured Psychopathological Interview and Rating of the Social Consequences of Psychological Disturbances for Epidemiology" (SPIKE). The 12-month prevalence of sleep problems was graded according to frequency and associated distress of reported symptoms. 12-month prevalence of suicidality was classified as either mild (transient suicidal ideation) or severe (self-harm, suicide attempts).
   Results: Concurrently, and fully adjusted for several covariates, including mental disorders, relative to no sleep problems there was an odds ratio (OR) of OR = 1.9 (95% confidence interval 1.4-2.5), OR = 3.3 (2.5-4.4), and OR = 1.9 (1.3-2.8) for mild, moderate and severe sleep problems in association with suicidality. There was no evidence for a prospective effect of broad sleep problems on subsequent suicidality. Mild suicidality, but not severe suicidality, prospectively predicted subsequent broad sleep problems in the fully adjusted multivariate model (adjusted OR = 1.5; 1.1-1.9). Disturbed sleep initiation, a proxy for insomnia, significantly predicted subsequent suicidality (OR = 1.5; 1.1-1.9), whereas mild suicidality, but not severe suicidality, significantly predicted subsequent insomnia (OR = 1.5; 1.1-2.0). Conclusions: Sleep problems and suicidality are longitudinally inter-related, which has important implications for clinical practice Most importantly, the causal pathways appear to be bi-directional and independent of socio-demographics and concomitant mental disorders More research is needed to examine the possible biopsychosocial etiological mechanisms linking suicidality to sleep problems.

AB Background
   Identifying essential competencies in end-of-life care, as well as general practitioners' (GPs) confidence in these competencies, is essential to guide training and quality improvement efforts in this domain.
   Aim
   To determine which competencies in end-of-life care are considered important by GPs, to assess GPs' confidence in these competencies in a European context and their reasons to refer terminally ill patients to a specialist.
   Design and Setting
   Cross-sectional postal survey involving a stratified random sample of 2000 GPs in Switzerland in 2014.
   Method
   Survey development was informed by a previous qualitative exploration of relevant end-of-life GP competencies. Main outcome measures were GPs' assessment of the importance of and confidence in 18 attributes of end-of-life care competencies, and reasons for transferring care of terminally-ill patients to a specialist. GP characteristics associated with main outcome measures were tested using multivariate regression models.
   Results
   The response rate was 31%. Ninety-nine percent of GPs considered the recognition and treatment of pain as important, 86% felt confident about it. Few GPs felt confident in cultural (16%), spiritual (38%) and legal end-of-life competencies such as responding to patients seeking assisted suicide (35%) although more than half of the respondents regarded these competencies as important. Most frequent reasons to refer terminally ill patients to a specialist were lack of time (30%), better training of specialists (23%) and end-of-life care being incompatible with other duties (19%). In multiple regression analyses, confidence in end-of-life care was positively associated with GPs' age, practice size, home visits and palliative training.
   Conclusions
   GPs considered non-somatic competencies (such as spiritual, cultural, ethical and legal aspects) nearly as important as pain and symptom control. Yet, few GPs felt confident in these non-somatic competencies. These findings should inform training and quality improvement efforts in this domain, in particular for younger, less experienced GPs.

AB The application of medical technology to prolong life at the expense of quality of life is widely debated in end-of-life care. A national survey of 3733 UK doctors reporting on the care of 2923 people who had died under their care is reported here. Results show that there was no time to make an 'end-of-life decision' (deciding to provide, withdraw or withhold treatment) for 8.5% of those reporting deaths. A further 55.2% reported decisions which they estimated would not hasten death and 28.9% reported decisions they had expected to hasten death. A further 7.4% reported deaths where they had to some degree intended to hasten death. Where patients or someone else had made a request for a hastened death, doctors were more likely to report expecting or at least partly intending to hasten death. Doctors usually made these decisions in consultation with colleagues, relatives and, where feasible, with patients. Intensive care specialists were particularly likely to report a degree of intention to hasten the end of life and to have treated patients lacking the capacity to discuss these decisions. Palliative medicine specialists were the least likely to report decisions they expected or at least partly intended to end life, in spite of reporting a high incidence of requests from their patients for a hastened death. Doctors with strong religious beliefs or who opposed the legalisation of assisted dying were unlikely to report such decisions. Elderly women and those with dementia are groups considered vulnerable in societies where a permissive approach is taken to hastening death in end-of-life care. but doctors describing these deaths were no more likely to report decisions which they expected or at least partly intended to end life. The survey suggests that concerns about the sanctity of life, as well as estimates of the quality of life, enter clinical decision-making. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To identify factors potentially protective against involvement with additional illicit drugs among adolescent users of marijuana.
   Design and Methods: A cross-sectional, secondary analysis of a national data set of Swiss adolescents was performed. The original survey was conducted in 1992-1993 (N = 9268). Stages of substance use were conceptualized as lifetime use of marijuana of three or more times and as use of marijuana and other illicit drugs (opiates, inhalants, cocaine, hallucinogens, or stimulants) more than twice in the past month. Behavioral characteristics associated with level of drug use were examined. Based on the resilience literature, factors potentially protective against progression of drug use were examined in their bivariate relationships and analyzed in a multiple regression model.
   Results: Almost one quarter of the surveyed adolescents were classified as past or current marijuana users. One in 20 of these adolescents also used other illicit drugs. Prevalence of risk-related behaviors (e.g., antisocial behavior, accidents, suicide attempts) was elevated for marijuana users compared to nonusers and even more elevated for users of marijuana with other illicit drugs. In a multivariate logistic regression model, communicating well with a parent was significantly associated with not having progressed to use of illicit drugs other than marijuana [for males, odds ratio (OR) = 0.72, confidence interval (CI) = 0.55, 0.92; for females, OR = 0.60, CI = 0.39, 0.93]. Other significant protective correlates for boys were academic achievement (OR = 0.66, CI = 0.47, 0.92), type of education: school versus apprenticeship (OR = 0.42, CI = 0.21, 0.87), confiding in a family member (OR = 0.49, CI = 0.28, 0.85), and regular participation in a sports club (OR = 0.39, CT = 0.22, 0.77).
   Conclusion: Within this national sample of Swiss adolescents, a cross-sectional analysis identified the quality of relationships within the family and factors related to school associated with lack of progression of illicit substance use. However, longitudinal studies will be necessary to confirm these associations and to allow for designing interventions targeting the enhancement of protective factors among young people already at risk for serious substance use.

AB Background: Involuntary admission (IA) for psychiatric treatment is a massive restriction of human rights. Therefore, its execution is regulated by law. During executing IAs referring physicians find themselves in a dual role: support of patients in the recovery process but also safe-keeper of society. In Zurich, Switzerland the law stipulates that physicians regardless of their medical specialization may admit patients who suffer from a mental disorder, mental disability or severe neglect involuntarily if care cannot be provided otherwise, regardless of their decision-making capacity. The referring physician is obliged to examine the patients, hear their views on the IA, inform them about the following steps and about their right of appeal at the civil court. We aimed to assess whether referring physicians can comply with those legal requirements for an IA. Additionally, we examined whether legal considerations differed according to the physicians professional backgrounds and attitudes towards coercion in general.
   Methods: We invited physicians from different in- and outpatient settings who executed IAs to the University Hospital of Psychiatry Zurich to participate in a newly developed online survey. We used correlation analysis, chi-square and t-tests to analyze the responses of 43 psychiatrists with those of 64 other physicians.
   Results: In about 1/3 of the IAs referring physicians were not able to hear the patients' views on the IA, to inform the patients about the following steps and about their right of appeal. Psychiatrists felt more certain with the legal basis of IA compared to physicians other than psychiatrists. Nevertheless, the latter stated that the assessment of the risk for suicide and danger should not be restricted only to psychiatrists. Both groups differed in their attitudes towards coercion with psychiatrists being more critical.
   Conclusions: Interventions should be developed to facilitate a compliance with legal requirements during IA. Physicians who execute IAs must have a thorough knowledge of the clinical and legal basis for their actions. We recommend specialized consultation teams for the assessment of PES and regular training including ethical discussions, especially for physicians other than psychiatrists.

AB Background: Results of epidemiological studies linking census with mortality records may be affected by unlinked deaths and changes in cause of death classification. We examined these issues in the Swiss National Cohort (SNC).
   Methods: The SNC is a longitudinal study of the entire Swiss population, based on the 1990 (6.8 million persons) and 2000 (7.3 million persons) censuses. Among 1,053,393 deaths recorded 1991-2007 5.4% could not be linked using stringent probabilistic linkage. We included the unlinked deaths using pragmatic linkages and compared mortality rates for selected causes with official mortality rates. We also examined the impact of the 1995 change in cause of death coding from version 8 (with some additional rules) to version 10 of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), using Poisson regression models with restricted cubic splines. Finally, we compared results from Cox models including and excluding unlinked deaths of the association of education, marital status, and nationality with selected causes of death.
   Results: SNC mortality rates underestimated all cause mortality by 9.6% (range 2.4%-17.9%) in the 85+ population. Underestimation was less pronounced in years nearer the censuses and in the 75-84 age group. After including 99.7% of unlinked deaths, annual all cause SNC mortality rates were reflecting official rates (relative difference between -1.4% and +1.8%). In the 85+ population the rates for prostate and breast cancer dropped, by 16% and 21% respectively, between 1994 and 1995 coincident with the change in cause of death coding policy. For suicide in males almost no change was observed. Hazard ratios were only negligibly affected by including the unlinked deaths. A sudden decrease in breast (21% less, 95% confidence interval: 12%-28%) and prostate (16% less, 95% confidence interval: 7%-23%) cancer mortality rates in the 85+ population coincided with the 1995 change in cause of death coding policy.
   Conclusions: Unlinked deaths bias analyses of absolute mortality rates downwards but have little effect on relative mortality. To describe time trends of cause-specific mortality in the SNC, accounting for the unlinked deaths and for the possible effect of change in death certificate coding was necessary.

AB Background: The current analyses examined whether the dysregulation profile (DP) 1) could be used to identify children and adolescents at high risk for complex and serious psychopathology and 2) was correlated to other emotional and behavioral problems (such as delinquent behavior or suicide ideation). DP was assessed using both the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Youth Self Report (YSR) in a residential care sample.
   Methods: Children and adolescents (N=374) aged 10-18 years living in residential care in Switzerland completed the YSR, and their professional caregivers completed the CBCL. Participants meeting criteria for DP (T-score >= 67 on the anxious/depressed, attention problems, and aggressive behavior scales of the YSR/CBCL) were compared against those who did not for the presence of complex psychopathology (defined as the presence of both emotional and behavioral disorders), and also for the prevalence of several psychiatric diagnoses, suicidal ideation, traumatic experiences, delinquent behaviors, and problems related to quality of life.
   Results: The diagnostic criteria for CBCL-DP and YSR-DP were met by just 44 (11.8%) and 25 (6.7%) of participants. Only eight participants (2.1%) met the criteria on both instruments. Further analyses were conducted separately for the CBCL-DP and YSR-DP groups. DP was associated with complex psychopathology in only 34.4% of cases according to CBCL and in 60% of cases according to YSR. YSR-DP was somewhat more likely to be associated with psychiatric disorders and associated problems than was the CBCL-DP.
   Limitations: Because of the relatively small overlap between the CBCL-DP and YSR-DP, analyses were conducted largely with different samples, likely contributing to the different results.
   Conclusions: Despite a high rate of psychopathology in the population studied, both the YSR-DP and the CBCL-DP were able to detect only a small proportion of those with complex psychiatric disorders. This result questions the validity of YSR-DP and the CBCL-DP in detecting subjects with complex and serious psychopathology. It is possible that different screening instruments may be more effective.
