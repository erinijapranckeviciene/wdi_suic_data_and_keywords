AB The purpose of this review is to explore the dynamics of suicide mortality rates in Ukraine during an ongoing armed conflict between 2014 and 2015. Suicide mortality data were obtained by reviewing annual analytical releases from the State Service for Emergent Situations of Ukraine and annual release of Russian Federal Service of State Statistics. Suicide mortality in mainland Ukraine and in the Crimea region demonstrated a mild decrease, whereas suicide mortality in the regions directly involved in the armed conflict demonstrated a prominent decrease. The results of this review support Durkheim theory. The limitation of this review includes general concern about quality of data at time of armed conflict in the country.

AB Background. Because the suicide rates in Eastern Europe have increased, the epidemiology of suicide behaviors in this part of the world is in urgent need of study. Using data from the Ukraine site of the World Mental Health (WMH) Survey Initiative, we present the first population-based findings from a former Soviet country on the descriptive epidemiology of suicide ideation, plans and attempts, and their links to current functioning and service utilization.
   Method. In 2002, a nationally representative sample of 4725 adults in Ukraine was interviewed with the World Health Organization (WHO) Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Risk factors included demographic characteristics, trauma, smoking, and parental and personal psychiatric disorders. Current functional impairments and recent service utilization were assessed.
   Results. The lifetime prevalence of suicide ideation was 8.2%. The average age of onset was 31. The key risk factors were female sex, younger age, trauma, parental depression, and prior alcohol, depressive and intermittent explosive disorders, especially the presence of co-morbidity. Ideators had poorer functioning and greater use of health services. One-third of ideators had a plan, and one-fifth made an attempt. Among ideators, young age, smoking and prior psychiatric disorders were risk factors for these behaviors.
   Conclusions. Together with the increasing suicide rate, these results suggest that suicide intervention programs in Ukraine should focus on the generation of young adults under 30. The associations with co-morbidity, impairments in current functioning and greater service use indicate that a physician education program on suicidality should be comprehensive in scope and a public health priority in Ukraine.

AB Having survived multiple catastrophes in the 20th century, newly independent Ukraine now has some of the highest injury death rates in Europe. The nation's most common type of injury death is suicide, and its rate is one of Europe's and the world's highest. Alcohol abuse occurs in 20% of men, and major depression in 20% of women. Suicide is the leading cause of death in the Ukrainian Army, which has begun to recognize and address the problem. Mental health is one of three current priorities of the Ukrainian Ministry of Public Health. The government is developing a mental health policy and plan, with potential for prevention of suicide. A national university in the capital has created a graduate school of public health to build human capacity to prevent and control disease and injury.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the spatial distribution of Eastern European suicide mortality both before and at the end of the Communist period, as well as the changes that occurred during this period.
   Regional data on suicide mortality were collected from Czarist "European Russia" in 1910 and from the corresponding area in 1989. The distribution of suicide mortality was mapped at both points in time. Regional continuity over time was further studied with the help of geographical units specially constructed for this purpose.
   In 1910, suicide mortality was found to be high in the northern Baltic provinces, in the urban parts of north and central Russia, the more urbanized parts of northern and western Poland, in east Ukraine, and in the northern Caucasus, while suicide rates were generally low in south Russia, Dagestan, and in southern Poland. In 1989, suicide mortality was highest in the Urals, the east Russian "ethnic" areas, and in southeast Russia. The rates were low in Poland, Moldavia, and in most of the northern Caucasus. The across-time analysis using specially constructed comparison units showed that the spatial distributions of suicide mortality in 19 10 and 1989 were not correlated with each other. Additional analyses pointed to a short-term consistency of regional patterns both in the 1900s-1920s and the 1980S-1990s.
   The lack of regional continuity in suicide mortality in the area may imply an absence of strong and continuous regional cultures, or a strong influence of other factors, such as societal modernization, on suicide mortality. Suicide as an act changed its social nature during the Communist period, becoming more normal, and more equally distributed among social classes and geographical locations. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Data on suicide rates and socioeconomic and medical factors were obtained from the Ukrainian State Statistical Office, WHO, and the European Social Survey. Structural equation modeling was used for data analysis. Religion and education were negatively associated with suicide. The relationship between drug addiction/alcoholism and suicide was positive. The association between urbanization and suicide mortality was negative. The relationship between gross regional product (GRP) and female suicide was slightly negative. Religiosity was the protective factor most strongly linked with suicide mortality followed by urbanization. The harmful role of drug addiction and alcoholism was confirmed. The role of education and GRP is controversial. No striking gender differences were found.

AB Male suicide rates in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and the Baltic countries increased substantially in the early 1990s and are now the highest in the world. To what extent is this suicide epidemic explained by the macroeconomic instability experienced by these countries in that period? Fixed effects regressions across 22 transition economies indicate that male suicide rates are highly sensitive to the state of the macroeconomy, suggesting that the steep and prolonged declines in GDP in the western countries of the former Soviet Union may have been partly to blame for the suicide epidemic. Evidence also indicates that the general adult male mortality crisis in the region had a 'feedback' effect on suicide rates, with the loss of a spouse or friend - or declining life expectancy itself - contributing to rising suicide rates. Female suicide rates, in contrast, are insensitive to the state of the macroeconomy and are more strongly related to alcohol consumption. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aims: Observed changes in subcategories of injury death were used to test the hypothesis that a sizeable proportion of "injury deaths of undetermined intent" (Y10-Y34 in ICD 10) in the Baltic and Slavic countries after the USSR dissolved in 1991 were hidden suicides. Methods: Using male age-adjusted suicide rates for two distinctly different periods, 1981-90 and 1992-2005, changes, ratios and correlations were calculated. The data were compared with the EU average. Results: After the USSR broke up, the obligation to make a definitive diagnosis became less strict. A massive increase in "injury deaths of undetermined intent" resulted. The mean rate for the second period reached 52.8 per 100,000 males in Russia (the highest rate) and 12.9 in Lithuania (the lowest), against 3.2 in EU-15. The rise from the first to the second period was highest in Belarus (56%) and Russia (44%). The number of injury deaths of undetermined intent was almost equal to that of suicides in Russia in 2005 (ratio 1.0) and Ukraine in 2002 (1.1). In all the countries, especially the Slavic ones, prevalence trends of injury-death subcategories were uniform, i.e. strongly correlated over time. No direct substitution of one diagnosis for another was evident. Conclusions: There is no evidence that the category of "injury deaths of undetermined intent" in the Baltic and Slavic countries hides suicides alone. Aggregate level analysis indicates that accidents and homicides could sometimes be diagnosed as undetermined.

AB Multiple lines of evidence indicate specific genetic contributions to suicidal behavior. In particular, geographic studies support the Finno-Ugrian Suicide Hypothesis, i.e., genetic differences between populations may partially account for geographic patterns of suicide prevalence. Specifically, within Europe the high suiciderate nations constitute a contiguous J-shaped belt. The present research replicated and extended 2003 findings of Voracek, Fisher, and Marugi with new data. Across 37 European nations, an interaction term of squared latitude multiplied with longitude (quantifying the J-shaped belt) accounted for 32% of the cross-national variance in total suicide rates alone, while latitude accounted merely for 18% of variance over and above those. Refined analysis included regional data from countries critical for testing the hypothesis (89 regions of Belarus, western Russia, and the Ukraine) and yielded an even more clear-cut pattern (56% and 3.5%, respectively), These results are consistent with the Finno-Ugrian Suicide Hypothesis. Study limitations and directions for further research are discussed.

AB Background The suicide rate is a macro indicator of the population's psychosocial wellbeing and an evaluation criterion of the effectiveness of suicide prevention strategies. A high level of injury deaths of undetermined intent (UD) is usually discussed in connection with the validity of suicide statistics. An effort is made to develop a criterion to characterise the quality of suicide statistics.
   Methods Standardised rates of suicides (X60-X84) and UD (Y10-Y34) by the International Classification of Disease version 10 as an average for the past five available years were taken from the WHO European mortality database. Rate ratios were computed by dividing rates of UD by suicide rates.
   Results There is considerable variation in suicide and UD rates among countries. The highest overall rates of UD were registered in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, and the lowest in Greece, Spain and Italy. The EU-15 average UD rate of 1.97 and the rate ratio of 0.194 UD to suicides were combined into a '2-20 benchmark', in which the primary indicator is 2.0 UD cases per 100 000 and the secondary indicator is the proportion of UD to suicides 0.20 (20%), which enables countries to be clustered according to the quality of suicide statistics. The following countries satisfied the benchmark: Greece, Norway, Spain, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Austria, Italy, Romania, Hungary, Ireland and Finland.
   Conclusion This study used the developed '2-20 benchmark' in Europe to assess suicide registration quality in a particular country, to compare the relative position of countries, and to set a target for those European countries that have not yet achieved the benchmark.

ID RISK-FACTORS; TRYPTOPHAN-HYDROXYLASE; TPH GENE; BEHAVIOR; RATES;
   METAANALYSIS; LONGITUDE; LATITUDE
AB There is now convergent evidence from classic quantitative genetics (family, twin, and adoption studies) and molecular genetic studies for specific genetic risk factors for suicidal behavior. This emerging research field has recently been supplemented by geographical studies concerned with the Finno-Ugrian Suicide Hypothesis (FUSH), which states that population differences in genetic risk factors may partially account for conspicuous geographical patterns seen in suicide prevalence. In particular, the European high-suicide-rate nations constitute a contiguous, J-shaped belt, spanning from Finland to Austria. This area maps onto the second principal component identified for European gene distribution, most likely reflecting a major migration event of the past (i.e., the ancestral adaptation to cold climates and the Uralic language dispersion) still detectable in modern European populations. The present research tested the hypothesis in the United States. Consistent with the hypothesis, available historical (1913-1924 and 1928-1932) U.S. state suicide rates were uniformly positively associated with available state proportions of reported American ancestries from European high-suicide-rate countries (Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, and the Ukraine). However, contrary to the hypothesis, available contemporary (1990-1994) suicide rates were uniformly negatively associated with these ancestry proportions. The findings of this first test outside Europe are therefore conflicting. A proposal based on the geographical study approach is offered to further the progress of investigations into the genetics of suicide.

AB To examine the pattern and trend of deaths due to external causes among Polish children and adolescents in 1999-2012, and to compare trends in Poland's neighboring countries.
   Death records were obtained from the Central Statistical Office of Poland. External causes mortality rates (MR) with 95 % confidence interval were calculated. The annual percentage change of MR was examined using linear regression. To compare MR with Belarus, Ukraine, Czech Republic and Germany, data from the European Mortality Database were used.
   MR were the highest in the age 15-19 years (33.7/100,000) and among boys (22.7/100,000). Unintentional injuries including transport accidents, drowning, and suicides (especially in children over 10 years old), were the main cause of death in the analyzed groups. Between 1999 and 2012 annual MR for unintentional injuries declined substantially. MR due to injuries and poisoning in Poland were higher compared with Czech Republic and Germany and lower in comparison with Belarus and Ukraine.
   Deaths due to unintentional injuries are still the leading cause of death among Polish children and adolescents. There are differences in death rates between Poland and neighboring countries.

AB In the present study, an attempt has been made to investigate the complete 'pattern' of a suicide attempter (SA) within the set of Big Five traits. Two models were used: M1, which includes the five main dimensions of Big Five in the analysis; and M2, which includes facets of those dimensions which were identified as important in M1. The study consisted of a group of SA (men - 326, women - 299) and a group of healthy volunteers (HV) (men - 143, women - 190) with a similar age range. Discriminant analysis (DA) showed that the factors most significant in discriminating the personality pattern of a male SA are (in decreasing order): (E) Extraversion, (N) Neuroticism, (C) Conscientiousness and (O) Openness; and for a female SA these factors were (E) Extraversion, (C) Conscientiousness and (A) Agreeableness. In M2 for men, the largest contribution to pattern recognition is (N3) Depression. Moreover, in M2 for men significant characteristics were (in descending order): (E6) Positive Emotions, (O1) Fantasy, (E4) Activity, and also (N2) Angry Hostility, (C3) Dutifulness, (C4) Achievement Striving, (C2) Order and (O6) Values; and for women: (E4) Activity, (C6) Deliberation, (C2) Order, (A6) Tender- Mindedness, (E5) Excitement Seeking, (E6) Positive Emotions, (C4) Achievement Striving, (A2) Straightforwardness, (C5) Self-Discipline and (E1) Warmth. Analysis of the obtained data demonstrates that suicide attempts amongst males, can largely be associated with personality variables reflecting negative emotions; while female suicide attempts are primarily associated with variables regarding activity and self-regulation.

AB Background. The psychological aftermath of the Chernobyl accident is regarded as the largest public health problem unleashed by the accident to date. Yet the mental health of the clean-up workers, who faced the greatest radiation exposure and threat to life, has not been systematically evaluated. This Study describes the long-term psychological effects of Chernobyl in a sample of clean-up workers in Ukraine.
   Method. The cohorts were 295 male clean-up workers sent to Chernobyl between 1986 and 1990 interviewed 18 years after the accident (71% participation rate) and 397 geographically matched controls interviewed as part of the Ukraine World Mental Health (WMS) Survey 16 years after the accident. The World Health Organization (WHO) Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) was administered. We examined group differences in common psychiatric disorders, suicide ideation and severe headaches, differential effects of disorder on days lost from work, and in the clean-up workers, the relationship of exposure severity to disorder and current trauma and somatic symptoms. Analyses were adjusted for age in 1986 and mental health prior to the accident.
   Results. Relatively more clean-tip workers than controls experienced depression (18.0% v. 13.1%) and suicide ideation (9.2% v. 4.1%) after the accident. In the year preceding interview, the rates of depression (14.9% v. 7.1%), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (4.1% v. 1.0%) and headaches (69.2% v. 12.4%) were elevated. Affected workers lost more work days than affected controls. Exposure level was associated with current somatic and PTSD symptom severity.
   Conclusions. Long-term mental health consequences of Chernobyl were observed in clean-up workers.

Among Southeast Asian boys and girls, smokers had elevated hopelessness in comparison to nonsmokers but among Central-Eastern European students, this relationship was true only for girls and there was no relationship for boys. Across the country samples, there was only association of smoking with loneliness among Southeast Asian girls and Central-Eastern European girls. While Southeast Asian girls who smoked scored higher on loneliness than nonsmokers, the opposite was true among Central-Eastern European girls, with smokers scoring lower on loneliness.

SO ECONOMIC ANNALS-XXI

DE Female Terrorism; Economic Background; Rational Choice; Legal Conflicts;
   Strategy of Eradicating Female Terrorism
AB The authors have researched the phenomenon of female terrorism in the area of rational choice and economic benefit. Popular quotations "qui prodesse" and "cherchez la femme" are combined from these positions in the non-standard authors' approach to understanding the motivational factors underlying extremist movements. It has been proved that the increase in the number of women in the ranks of terrorists is largely due to the so-called economic benefit factor for the terrorist acts organisers. The actions of a suicide bomber, in the broad sense, are predominantly based on a rational basis: the achievement of the last personal good - identity. The article presents the transformation of female terrorism in the historical perspective; actual conflicts and contradictions in international law and national legal systems, as well as false social attitudes and stereotypes complicating the fight against this dangerous social phenomenon.
   Data obtained from the social networks allows concluding that hundreds of women are now fighting in the ranks of militants in the East of Ukraine. At the beginning of the conflict, many of them hid their faces on personal pages on the Internet, hiding from their relatives a fact that they are hired killers. At the moment, most of them are proud of their participation in extremist groups, post their photos with weapons. Suicide terrorism of Muslim women and crimes committed by female militants in the East of Ukraine have one thing in common - the preparation and use of women as a living "weapon" by the extremist groups is cheaper either in terms of financial investments and costs for psychological brainwashing and military training.
   Based on the analytical data and identified patterns, we have argued the strategic directions of counteraction to female terrorism and have proved the following: mankind will be able to break this danger on the condition of a new, free of stereotypes way of thinking and coordinated efforts of the world community in all spheres of social life including economic, legal, socio- and cultural ones.

AB Mortality from circulatory diseases has been the greatest contributor to unfavorable changes in Russian life expectancy during the last 30 years. In the mid-1980s mortality from circulatory diseases experienced a short-term decrease, likely due to the anti-alcohol campaign of 1985. However, in the early 1990s there was a sharp increase in circulatory disease mortality, following socioeconomic crisis and rising alcohol consumption. This unusual trend, characteristic of Russia, the Ukraine and other countries of the former Soviet Union, stands in contrast to that of Western Europe, where mortality from circulatory diseases has been decreasing continuously. It also differs from mortality trends in Eastern Europe, where certain improvements have been achieved since the collapse of communism. Increasing mortality from ischemic heart disease and from cerebrovascular disorders are the biggest components of the overall increase in mortality from circulatory diseases in Russia. In proportional terms, mortality from "other" heart diseases experienced the greatest increase among other cardiovascular causes of death. Increases in circulatory disease mortality among men were greater than for women, and tended to occur at younger ages. Further, proportional mortality analyses on individual death records from the Udmurt Republic show that the risk of death at working ages from circulatory diseases is significantly elevated in people with low levels of education, although for men the educational gradient is stronger for external causes (accidents, homicides, suicides) and alcohol-related conditions. In addition, a case-control study based on "verbal autopsy" inter-views suggests that the risk of cardiovascular death among men aged 20 to 55 is also increased among those who are unemployed or not married. The social-status differentials in cardiovascular mortality among working-age men are largely attributable to smoking and heavy alcohol drinking, which are also the most important factors in terms of population attributable risk.

AB The article synthetically presents the actions of the military, the Internal Security Corps and the security apparatus against the underground after the of Operation Vistula. It aims to show the attempts to destroy the remainder of the UPA and OUN forces and the ensuing results. The displacements of the remaining Ukrainian population from the province of Lublin are also discussed, Even before the end of Operation Vistula, two operational groups were formed, numbering about 10,000 soldiers in total. Their task was facilitated by the demobilisation of partisans carried out in the autumn of 1947 by the command of the Ukrainian underground in Poland. The majority returned to Ukraine to continue fighting, while some tried to get through to the American zone of occupation in Germany. The actions of the military and the Internal Security Corps did not yield significant results. The biggest success was tracking down and surrounding the bunker in which the national OUN commander Jaro slaw Staruch "Stiah" was hiding, who later committed suicide. In November 1947, when the demobilisation of Ukrainian partisans was discovered, the operational groups were disbanded; combating the last Ukrainian partisans was entrusted to the local units of militia and the Internal Security Corps.

AB Objectives: We sought to examine whether there were gender differences in the relationship of depressive, anxiety-related, and somatic symptomatology to the presence, severity, and duration of asthma. Methods: A total of 54 adult asthma patients (24 women, 30 men) and 31 healthy subjects (19 women, 12 men) were studied. Within each gender group, patients' psychological distress levels were compared as a function of severity (mild vs. moderate) and duration of disease ( <5 vs. + years), to each other and with healthy subjects. Data were collected in Ukraine utilizing the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), the best-validated psychological assessment instrument in Eastern European populations. Results: Relative to healthy women, women with both mild and moderate asthma showed elevated distress in multiple domains reflecting somatic and psychological complaints. In contrast, only men with relatively more severe disease of longer duration showed elevated symptomatology relative to healthy men, with depressive symptoms predominating. Conclusion: To the extent that distress in response to asthma takes a more diffuse form and may be expressed at milder and earlier stages of the disease in women than men, the findings suggest the need to tailor asthma education and behavioral interventions to the unique psychological needs of women and men in order to be maximally effective.

AB The failure of central planning in the totalitarian systems of the USSR and its satellites adversely affected not only the economy and social relations but also the population health. While in the countries with established democracy (DEM) the general health and the life expectancy (LE) steadily improved, in countries declaring socialism (SOC) the LE was stagnant and in the USSR even decreased. Dramatic changes in Russia after the demise of Soviet Union resulted in an extraordinary destabilization of LE that reached a minimum in 1994. Remarkably, even twenty years after the breakdown of the Iron Curtain there persists a gap in the general health between the DEM and the SOC regions of Europe. Within the territory of the former Soviet influence there are additional differences in LE: Central Europe is much better off than Russia and its neighbours. Main cause of relatively high mortality in the post totalitarian Europe is the cardiovascular disease (CVD). Among females about 80 % difference in LE between DEM and SOC countries is related to premature CVD mortality. In SOC males compared to DEM, about 50 % of the higher mortality is caused by CVD, 20 % is related to external factors (trauma, suicide) and 10 % is oncologic disorders. The main suggested cause of such excess mortality, besides a low socioeconomic level and limited funding for health care, is an improper life style: alcoholism, smoking and inadequate intake of protective nutrients. Alcoholism, especially binge drinking is a prominent factor in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and in the Baltic Republics (Fig. 6, Tab. 4, Ref. 20). Full Text in free PDF www.bmj.sk.

ID CONSUMER-BEHAVIOR; AGGRESSION; WORKPLACE; EMPLOYEES
AB The beginning of the 21st Century is characterized by significant acceleration of various types of changes in the world, especially in Central and Easter European markets (Mruk 2007, p. 9). These changes generate important influence on customer/patient of medical market and may have both positive and negative effect on their behavior, which has been well demonstrated in the recent global economic crisis. It is worth noting that the current crisis is of a system character and spreads as a result of correlations which are typical of the globalization process (Kolodko 2009, p. 2). Difficulties caused by the crisis across the whole economy, mounted by constant transformation processes, often result in various social problems including alcoholism, drug addiction, crime, divorce, suicide mental and civilization diseases, social care and education failure, abuse in the family, etc. Hence, it can be stated that the rate of changes in the developing economies is bigger than consumers' awareness of the ongoing changes and their ability to grasp the processes. The emerging disintegrative processes are reflected in the consumer market behavior and leads to a phenomenon of consumers' negative adaptation to this reality. Systematically, consumers tend to take a more liberal approach towards phenomena that only recently were considered negative or even pathological. In these circumstances, customer behavior pathologyrelated issues on the medical market present one of the most interesting, both theoretically and practically, economic subjects. That is why the purpose of the paper was to identify pathologies in patients' behavior on medical market. Very important purpose of the paper was to characterize determinant which diversification pathological behavior of patients on medical market. To reach the above-presented purposes, a survey was conducted with the use of a structured questionnaire in Poland, Romania and Ukraine.
