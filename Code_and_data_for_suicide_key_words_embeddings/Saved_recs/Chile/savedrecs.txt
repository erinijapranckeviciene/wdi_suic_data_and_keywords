AB Background: Suicide is an important public health problem accounting for an important proportion of deaths in Chile. Aim: To describe trends in suicide mortality in Chile between 1998 and 2011, by year, region, sex and age. Material and Methods: A population survey study was conducted using suicide mortality data of Chile from 1998 to 2011, provided by the statistics department of the Ministry of Health, Coroners' offices and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/WHO). Age-adjusted suicide mortality rates were calculated per 100,000 habitants. Variables analyzed included year, age, sex, etiology and geographical distribution. An analysis of the average annual variation (AAV) was performed and the logarithm of the age-adjusted rates by year and region was fitted by applying linear regression models. Relative risks (RR) by sex, geographical distribution and age were also calculated. Results: The mean suicide rate in Chile, was 12.11 per 100.000 in the period 2000-2011. The rates were higher in men, with a higher AAV in women and a relative risk for men was 5.14 higher than in women. The rates were higher in the southern regions of the country Atacama had the highest AAV. By age, the rates are consistently higher in subjects aged 40 to 59 years until 2006, when this pattern started to change. Between 2006 and 2009, subjects aged 25-39 years had the highest rates. Subjects aged 0 to 14 years, exhibit the highest AAV Conclusions: The distribution of suicide rates by sex in Chile is similar to other countries, but it is different by age. The age range with the highest suicide rates changed over time.

TI Suicide and gross domestic product in Chile:: Toward a predictive model
SO REVISTA LATINOAMERICANA DE PSICOLOGIA
LA Spanish
DT Article
DE suicide; GDP; Chile; globalization
ID HEALTH; ENVIRONMENT; INEQUALITY; MORTALITY
AB In this article suicide is examined from a psychological and economical perspective. Contrasting with the relatively low rates of suicide in Latin America as compared to ex-URSS and other European countries, this phenomenon has experienced a progressive growth in Chile, especially among 15-34 years old population. The analysis of suicide rates in Chile for the 1981-2002 period shows an ascending and uneven curve, which is correlated with some economical indexes, such as GDP (r=0.87). A predictive model that relates GDP and suicide (error of 3.8%) is presented. Chilean global social market economy model has lead to economical growth but it has caused economic and health inequality, precarious labour conditions, and interpersonal distrust, which may explain the poor mental health indicators, as measure by growing suicide rates. In this analysis of suicide, several methodological difficulties were found. First, there is a lack of updated databases, which makes difficult the comparisons among Latin-American countries. Second, it is very difficult to get individual information for most cases of suicide, and, when it is available, the records are incomplete, lacking of epidemiologically relevant data, such a the educational level of the victim. It is concluded that an analysis of suicide in Latin-America should include both a psycho-social and an economical perspective. Researchers, officers and authorities are encouraged to update the databases in the countries of the region.

ID STRATEGIES
AB Objective: we present the preliminary results of the implementation of RADAR: a community suicide prevention program in adolescents implemented in two high schools in a south region of Chile. Method: In a pilot study, during 2016, we implemented RADAR in two high schools of Puerto Aysen, in in the Region of Aysen of Chile. A total of 409 actors were trained (among students, school teachers, caregivers and health professionals) for the screening and referral of high suicide risk adolescents. Results: Out of a total of 144 students who passed the RADAR screening systems, 29 cases were detected as suicide risk (20%) and 27 of them were opportunely referred to the Emergency Service of the Hospital of Puerto Aysen. In the second RADAR screening campaign, 3 months later, 90% of the cases no longer presented suicide risk. Conclusion: These results show the high proportion of adolescents at risk of suicide who are not visible by the health system and the feasibility of implementing RADAR in the community as an effective suicide prevention intervention.

AB Background: Despite the many studies trying to evaluate the magnitude of suicide in Chile, none of them include the new valid data, recently published by the DEIS of the Chilean Health Ministry. Aim: This paper sought to describe how suicide rates changed among Chileans who were at least 15 years of age during the period of 2001-2010; these rates were stratified by sex, age, urban/rural status, and region of the country. Method: An exploratory and temporal study was conducted. Suicide mortality rates were calculated by collecting information from the Chilean Ministry of Health's death registry between 2001 and 2010 among subjects who were at least 15 years of age. Crude and age-adjusted mortality rates were computed. Results: The standardized suicide rate in Chile during 2001-2010 was 14.7 deaths per 100,000, the highest in South America. The minimum age-adjusted suicide rate observed during the examined period was 13.49 per 100,000 in 2005, and the maximum, 16.67 per 100,000 in 2008. Suicide rates among men were up to 4.8 times the suicide rates among women. In addition, rates in rural areas were double compared with urban areas. Hanging was the most common suicide method, followed by use of firearms and explosives in men and poisoning in women. Finally, there was a progressive increase in suicide rates in the southernmost regions of the country. Conclusion: Suicide rates in Chile are relatively high among male subjects in rural areas. There is a disturbing increase in suicide rates among younger individuals and women, although these rates remain lower among younger individuals and women than among adults in general.

AB Background: There is an increasing concern for addressing suicide among adolescents in Latin America. Recent mental health policies encourage the development and implementation of preventive interventions for suicide. Such initiatives, however, have been scarcely developed, even in countries with solid mental health services such as Chile. The use of information and communications technology (ICT) might contribute to create accessible, engaging, and innovative platforms to promote well-being and support for adolescents with mental health needs and suicide risk.
   Objective: To evaluate a program based on ICT to prevent suicide and enhance mental health among adolescents in Chile. Method: A cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted including 428 high-school students aged 18-14 years in two regions of Chile. Study procedures will take place as follows: (1) design of the intervention model and creation of prototype; (2) selection and randomization of the participating public schools; (3) implementation of the 3-month intervention and evaluation at baseline, post-intervention period, and a 2-month follow-up. Suicidal ideation at the 2-month follow up is the primary outcome in this study. Secondary outcomes include negative psychological outcomes (e.g., stigma, depression, anxiety) as well as a number of protective psychological and social factors. Indicators regarding the study implementation will be also gathered. Discussion: Here we describe a novel program based on technological devices and aimed to target youth suicide in Chile. This is the first clinical trial of such a program in Latin America, and to our knowledge, the first of its kind in any middle income country.

AB Background: According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, suicide is one of the five leading causes of death among people aged 15-24 years. Suicide rates in Chile among young people have been increasing. In 1990 and 2005, the prevalence of suicide was 8.8% and 93 96 per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively Aims: To determine the prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt rates among teenagers aged 14 and 19 years, living in Metropolitan Santiago and analyze the factors related to suicide. Material and Methods: A self administered enquiry, containing a depression scale and five questions about suicide tendency, was applied to a representative sample of teenagers aged between 14 and 19 years, attending public and private schools in Metropolitan Santiago. Results: The enquiry was answered by 1567 teenagers aged between 14 and 20 years (54% males). Sixty two percent recognized suicidal ideation and 19%, suicidal attempts. These figures were significantly higher among women and those attending public schools. Sixteen years old adolescents had the highest rates of suicidal ideation and attempts Conclusions: There is a high rate of suicidal ideation and attempts among teenagers living m Metropolitan Santiago.

ID DEPRESSION; TRENDS; ADULTS
AB Mental health problems are a set of high-impact conditions. People aged 60 years and over are particularly vulnerable to factors that increase their risk of experiencing mental health problems and fatal outcomes, such as suicide. Within this age group, men as a subgroup are seldom the targets of relevant public health measures. This article aims to characterize the mental health status of men aged 60 years and over in Chile by using data from population-based surveys carried out in the country: the 2003 and 2009 National Health Surveys (NHS), the 2009 National Study of Dependency in Older Persons (ENADEAM), and the 2015 National Socioeconomic Characterization Survey (CASEN). The article looks at indicators for depression and depressive symptoms, suicide, and suicidal ideation, as well as mental health visits. According to reported figures from these surveys, older men in Chile constitute the population subgroup with the highest suicide rate, the lowest reported rates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, and the lowest reported frequency of mental health visits. Furthermore, men report depression less often than women. These figures provide an approximate picture of the mental health profile of older men in Chile and give rise to questions regarding the relevance of current epidemiological models for the identification of mental health risk profiles in this group. They also point to the urgent need to design health programs that integrate gender considerations in order to ensure proper screening and the acceptability of potential interventions for promoting mental health and reducing risk factors among older men.

AB In Chile, interruption of hemodialysis is cause of death in 0.37% of patients under this treatment. We report a 83-year-old woman suffering from chronic renal failure who withdrew from prolonged hemodialysis treatment. Biographical aspects, circumstances and the cause of death are analyzed from forensic and psychiatric points of view, highlighting attributes that allow classification of the death of this patient as suicide. Risk factors involved in this type of patients, as well as possible preventive measures are discussed. (Rev Med Chile 2012; 140: 771-774).

TI Seasonal variation in suicidal deaths in Chile: Its relationship to
   latitude
SO PSYCHOPATHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE suicide; seasons; latitude; Chile
ID SEX; AGE
AB Background: Studies in the northern and southern hemispheres consistently identified seasonal influences on monthly and semester suicide distribution. The variations of sunlight exposure in zones of increasing latitude has been suggested as one of the most plausible explanations for this phenomenon. Some recent studies in the northern hemisphere could not find seasonal asymmetries of suicides. The current study examines the monthly, seasonal and semester distribution of suicidal deaths in Chile and the influence of seasons in zones of low latitude as compared with regions of high or very high latitude, trying to determine if a seasonal pattern still exists in a country of the southern hemisphere. Methods: Monthly, seasonal and semester suicidal data over the period 1995-1999 were examined for the whole sample and for gender-specific subgroups in Chile. Four different latitudinal zones were analyzed separately, in order to investigate the effect of the photoperiod on suicide distribution. Results were analyzed by chi(2) tests for multinomials, as an overall measure of deviation. Results: We found a significant unimodal springtime peak for both genders in the global territory. Among the 4,710 male and 829 female suicides reported in this period there were no gender differences in the seasonal pattern of suicidal deaths. When divided into four different latitudinal zones, the regions with low latitude ( north of the country) showed no significant differences, while central and southern zones ( higher latitude) show a significant springtime pattern. In the extreme south of the country, no significant differences were found, probably due to the very small number of cases. Conclusion: The study confirms the existence of a unimodal springtime peak of suicides in Chile, but not in the zone of low latitude. Results support the notion that the seasonal impact on suicidal distribution is a function of photoperiod. Copyright (c) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB Both euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been sufficiently explored by Chilean experts, lack of reflection heightened when referring to minors. This article aims to make clear that the main provisions of fundamental rights related to euthanasia and assisted suicide in minors, that is the right to life and the rights of children and adolescents, admit diverse interpretations and, therefore, they may be used to argue in favor or against the legalization of such issues. After a brief definition of the concepts considered and a general view of compared legislation, the main rights involved are addressed, making clear that the supposed legal impediments to decriminalization of euthanasia and assisted suicide, are interpretations of rights involved, which they are not completely concordant with current tendencies about the theory of fundamental rights and, therefore, the only variation in interpretation will allow to open the possibility of a regulation that, at least, will not penalize all cases of euthanasia and assisted suicide of minors in Chile.

AB Purpose: To examine suicide mortality trends among young people (10-24 years of age(1)) in selected countries and territories of the Americas.
   Methods: An ecological study was conducted using a time series of suicide mortality data from 19 countries and one territory in the Region of the Americas from 2001 to 2008, comprising 90.3% of the regional population. The analyses included age-adjusted suicide mortality rates, average annual variation in suicide mortality rates, and relative risks for suicide, by age and sex.
   Results: The mean suicide rate for the selected study period and countries/territory was 5.7/100,000 young people (10-24 years), with suicide rates higher among males (7.7/100,000) than females (2.4/100,000). Countries with the highest total suicide mortality rates among young people (10-24 years) were Guyana, Suriname, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Chile, and Ecuador; countries with the lowest total suicide mortality rates included Mexico, Venezuela, Cuba, and Brazil, and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. During this period, there was a significant increase in suicide mortality rates among young people in the following countries: Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, and Suriname; countries with significant decreases in suicide mortality rates included Canada, Colombia, Cuba, El Salvador, and Venezuela. The three leading suicide methods in the Americas were hanging, firearms, and poisoning.
   Conclusions: Some countries of the Americas have experienced a rise in adolescent and youth suicide during the study period, with males at a higher risk of committing suicide than females. Adolescent and youth suicide policies and programs are recommended, to curb this problem. Methodological limitations are discussed. (C) 2014 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

AB Background: Suicidal behavior ranges from ideation to consummation of suicide. In Chile, rates of suicide increased from 4.8 to 12.7/100,000 in the period 1992-2009. Aim: To evaluate the prevalence of suicidal behavior and its relationship with socio-demographic factors and psychiatric diseases. Material and Methods: The Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), was applied to a representative sample of 2,978 Chilean participants. The prevalence of four suicidal behaviors (thinking about or wishing death, suicide ideation and suicide attempts) and of psychiatric diseases according to the revised third version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM III-R), was calculated. Results: The lifetime prevalence of suicidal conception was 14.3% and the suicide attempt 7.7%, the latest associated with sex, age, school years, smoking habits, being married or having a relationship, depressive disorders, dysthymia, and alcohol, drug and tobacco dependence. Conclusions: Rates founded exceed international prevalence data and extrapolated to current rates of completed suicide, higher levels of suicidal behavior should be expected. Considering the associated disorders we can infer that it is essential a correct diagnosis and treatment of mood disorders and substance consumption to any other specific interventions.

AB Background: Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is an analgesic and antipyretic drug widely used across the world. Its ingestion is one of the most common causes of drug overdose. In the United States is the first cause of acute hepatitis in adults. Aim: To describe the epidemiological profile of paracetamol overdose in Chile. Material and Methods: Cross sectional retrospective study that included all the phone call inquiries received at the Poison Control Center of the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile (CITUC) during 2009. Results: Nine hundred fifty nine inquiries involving acute paracetamol exposures were received. Women represented a 63.1% of the cases. Half of the cases were suicide attempts, of which 74.8% were women. Accidental exposures occurred mainly in children. In 29.3% of the patients, the exposure was considered to involve a hepatotoxic dose. Women had 2.7 times the risk of men to ingest a toxic dose of paracetamol with suicidal purpose (Odds ratio (OR) = 2.7; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.1-3.6; p < 0.001). Adolescents had 3.4 times the risk of the general consultants (OR: 3.4; 95% CI: 2.4-4.7; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Paracetamol overdose is common in Chile. Authorities should carry out preventive measures. Antidotes and the capacity to measure plasma levels of paracetamol should be available in healthcare centers. (Rev Med Chile 2012; 140: 313-318).

AB This article analyses and compares the epidemiology of mental disorders and relevant public policies in Chile and Finland. In Chile, a specific mental health law is still lacking. While both countries highlight the role of primary care, Finland places more emphasis on participation and recovery of service users. Comprehensive mental health policies from Finland, such as a successful suicide prevention program, are presented. Both countries have similar prevalence of mental disorders, high alcohol consumption and high suicide rates. In Chile, the percentage of total disease burden due to psychiatric disorders is 13% and in Finland 14%. However, the resources to address these issues are very different. Finland spends 4.5% of its health budget on mental health, while in Chile the percentage is 2.2%. This results in differences in human resources and service provision. Finland has five times more psychiatric outpatient visits, four times more psychiatrists, triple antidepressant use and twice more clinical guidelines for different psychiatric conditions. In conclusion, both countries have similar challenges but differing realities. This may help to identify gaps and potential solutions for public health challenges in Chile. Finland's experience demonstrates the importance of political will and long-term vision in the construction of mental health policies.

AB Background: Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder in people with suicidal behavior. The knowledge of its risk factors should help to design preventive strategies. Aim: To describe suicidal behavior and risk factors for attempted suicide in people with major depressive disorders (MDD). Material and Methods: A 12-month follow-up study was conducted in 112 outpatients at three psychiatric care centers of Nuble, Chile, with baseline and quarterly assessments. Demographic, psychosocial and clinical factors as potential risk factors of suicide attempts, were assessed. A clinical interview with DSM-IV diagnostic criteria checklist, Hamilton Depression Scale and the List of Threatening Experiences and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support were applied. Results: Sixty seven percent of participants had suicidal ideation and 43.8% had attempted suicide. Suicide risk was significantly higher in participants with a single major depressive episode (odds ratio [OR] = 3.98; 95% confidence intervals [CI] = 1,29-12,32 p = 0.02) and those with previous suicide attempts (OR = 13.15; 95% CI = 3,87-44.7 p < 0.01). Young age, not having a partner, being unemployed, having a severe major depressive episode, having psychotic symptoms, having a personality disorder and being devoid of medical illness increased the risk of suicide attempts, but they did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: Significant risk factors should be specially considered when designing suicide preventive strategies in patients with MDD.

AB Objective: To analyze suicidal behavior and build a predictive model for suicide risk using data mining (DM) analysis.
   Methods: A study of 707 Chilean mental health patients (with and without suicide risk) was carried out across three healthcare centers in the Metropolitan Region of Santiago, Chile. Three hundred forty-three variables were studied using five questionnaires. DM and machine-learning tools were used via the support vector machine technique.
   Results: The model selected 22 variables that, depending on the circumstances in which they all occur, define whether a person belongs in a suicide risk zone (accuracy = 0.78, sensitivity = 0.77, and specificity = 0.79). Being in a suicide risk zone means patients are more vulnerable to suicide attempts or are thinking about suicide. The interrelationship between these variables is highly nonlinear, and it is interesting to note the particular ways in which they are configured for each case. The model shows that the variables of a suicide risk zone are related to individual unrest, personal satisfaction, and reasons for living, particularly those related to beliefs in one's own capacities and coping abilities.
   Conclusion: These variables can be used to create an assessment tool and enables us to identify individual risk and protective factors. This may also contribute to therapeutic intervention by strengthening feelings of personal well-being and reasons for staying alive. Our results prompted the design of a new clinical tool, which is fast and easy to use and aids in evaluating the trajectory of suicide risk at a given moment.

AB Background: Adolescent suicide rates (ASR) are a matter of concern worldwide. Causes of this trend are not understood and could correspond to socioeconomic factors such as inequality. Aim: To investigate sociodemographic variables related to ASR, particularly the potential association with indicators of socioeconomic inequality. Method: Cross-sectional ecological study analyzing data from 29 health districts with univariate and multivariable multilevel Poisson models. Results: ASR were higher in male adolescents and at increasing age. No association was found between ASR and inequality (Gini coefficient and 20/20 ratio). Analysis revealed that living in a single-parent family is associated with ASR. Conclusions: The usual demographic patterns of adolescent suicide apply in Chile. An emerging variable of interest is single-parent family. No cross-sectional association between social inequality and ASR was found based on conflicting evidence. These results should be explored in future prospective population studies to further understand associated social factors.

   SYMPTOMS; RISK; FEAR; AFTERMATH; MODEL; PREDICTORS; DISORDERS
AB Background: Natural disasters are associated with a variety of negative health consequences, including enhanced suicide risk. Factors that moderate the relationship between disaster exposure and enhanced suicide risk are unknown. The aim of the current study was to determine whether pre-disaster PTSD moderates the association between change over time in thoughts of death, suicidal ideation (SI), suicide plans, and suicide attempts (SA) from pre-to post-disaster.
   Methods: Participants (n = 2832) were recruited from Chile as part of the larger PREDICT study and completed a measure of lifetime PTSD and panic disorder at baseline and a lifetime death/suicide measure at baseline in 2003 and again 6, 12, and 24 months later (i.e. "pre-disaster"). One year following a major earthquake and tsunami in 2010 (i.e., "post-disaster"), participants completed another death/suicide measure.
   Results: Both those with and without pre-disaster PTSD experienced significant increases in SI from pre-to postdisaster. However, pre-disaster PTSD was associated with significantly accelerated increases in thoughts of death and SI from pre-to post-disaster. At nearly all time-points, pre-disaster PTSD was associated with higher thoughts of death and SI, suicide planning, and SA. In contrast, panic disorder did not moderate the association between time and changes in SI.
   Limitations: There was a long time-gap between pre-disaster and post-disaster, with limited data about what occurred during this time.
   Conclusion: Pre-disaster PTSD is an important predictor of increased SI following a natural disaster, and groups with pre-disaster PTSD should be prioritized for receipt of mental health resources following a natural disaster.

   CHICAGO; MOTHERS; WOMEN
AB Introduction: The victimization of children has attracted considerable attention over the years. Some authors conceptualize child murder as an intra-familial phenomenon. Over the last 40 years, extensive literature has suggested that there are differences between neonaticide and infanticide, and differential characteristics between filicidal men and women. Although suicide attempts after these crimes have not been as widely studied, there are some distinctive features compared to non-suicidal filicide.
   Study purpose: The main objective of the current study was to analyze the phenomenon of filicide in the Chilean population.
   Methods: The sample consisted of 98 cases of filicide committed in Chile between 1998 and 2009 that were evaluated in the Area of Mental Health of the Legal Medical Service (LMS) of Santiago, Chile. Forensic reports including psychiatric and psychological evaluations of the perpetrators were reviewed and variables extracted. Bivariate analyses were used to determine differences between male and female filicide perpetrators and the possible differences between the presence and absence of a suicide attempt following filicide on selected demographic, situational, and psychopathological variables. Then, logistic regression was used to identify which of the variables may be relevant (significant predictors) to the presence of a suicide attempt following the commission of an infanticide.
   Results and discussion: Analysis of the data revealed differences between filicidal men and women with regard to demographic characteristics, but the differences in psychopathological factors and variables that were related to the crimes were minor. A comparative analysis of the filicide perpetrators based on post-crime suicide attempts did not find significant differences between groups. In addition, a predictive analysis of suicidal behavior concludes that individual variables (such as the level of education of the person committing infanticide and the method used for the homicide) are not sufficient to explain the entire phenomenon by themselves.

AB Background: Suicide is the third cause of death among adolescents in United States and between 5 to 12% of teenagers have history of suicide attempt. Therefore suicide is a public health problem in this age group. Aim: To compare the clinical characteristics of hospitalized adolescents who attempted suicide with those without a history of suicide attempt. Material and Methods: The clinical records of adolescents aged less than 18 years, hospitalized in a psychiatric clinic, were analyzed. Forty six patients aged 15 2 years (72% females) had a history of suicide attempt and were considered cases and 81 patients aged 15 +/- 2 years (52% females) did not have a history of suicide attempt and were considered controls. Demographical and clinical characteristics of both groups were compared. Psychiatric diagnoses were based oil the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM IV). Results: No significant differences were found between groups in the length of hospital stay. The Most common psychiatric diagnosis was depressive disorder, found in 71 and 35% of suicide and non suicide attempters, respectively (p < 0.01). Personality diagnosis Was deferred in most studied cases. Conclusions: Depression is more common among hospitalized adolescents who attempt suicide. (Rev Med Chile 2010; 138: 160-167).

AB Background and Objectives: Studying suicide notes is a strong methodology in suicidology and one of the most relevant theoretical frameworks is the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide proposed by Joiner. This study analyzed 80 suicide notes collected in Chile searching for the risk factors proposed by the theory and its implications. The clinical and sociodemographic characteristics of the notes' authors were analyzed too.
   Methods: The suicide notes were classified according to the presence or absence of the suicide risk factors proposed by the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide and were analyzed linguistically with the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program.
   Results: One or both interpersonal risk factors indicated by the theory were identified in 60% of the notes. The "lack of belonging" factor was the most common risk factor, and various linguistic profiles in the suicide notes were found according to the presence or absence of this factor.
   Conclusions: We confirmed the relevance of the interpersonal risk factors proposed as issues present in a high percentage of notes and found linguistic differences according to its presence or absence in the suicide notes.

AB The present study aimed to explore the burden of separation from children and its relationship with suicide risk in prisoners with minor children at the moment of admission into the penal justice system. Suicide risk was assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview in newly admitted female (n = 198) and male (n = 229) prisoners in Santiago de Chile. The burden of separation from minor children was rated on a numeric rating scale. Both genders showed high burden of separation from children at imprisonment. Mothers had significantly lower suicide risk than women without children. The relative risk was 0.31 (95% CI [0.16-0.6], p < 0.001) to show 'high suicide risk'. There was no difference of suicide risk between imprisoned fathers and male prisoners without children. Within the group of fathers, the suicide risk associated with the burden of separation. Our study indicates that strengthening the parent role and facilitating parent-child contacts during imprisonment could be an important element of suicide prevention interventions.

AB Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics are compared among women with affective disorder diagnosis and suicidality, treated in the Psychiatry Service of the Hospital del Salvador (SPHDS) in Santiago de Chile. The database of the SPHDS about women treated as outpatients between 2003 and 2010, was analyzed (n=214), comparing religious affiliation, suicidal risk type, affective disorder diagnoses, comorbidity with personality disorder and OQ 45.2 score. Non-believers treated patients were younger (M=38) than believers (M=39,36) They didn't differ in other sociodemographic or clinical characteristics, neither in presence or absence of suicidal ideation or attempts. The main difference found among women with affective disorder and suicidal risk was the greater severity of the clinical condition among the outpatient non-believers.

Subjects and Methods: Suicidal behavior, Loneliness (UCLA), Impulsivity (Barratt) scales and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), were applied to 763 high school students aged 14 to 19 years (49% males), living in Chillan, Chile. Results: Nineteen percent of participants had attempted suicide and 34.3% had suicidal ideation. Loneliness, impulsivity and alcohol use were directly related to suicidal behavior. These predictors explained 31% of the suicidal behavior. The most important risk factor was loneliness, followed by female gender, impulsivity and alcohol use. Conclusions: Loneliness, impulsivity and alcohol use are risk factors for suicide among adolescents. Women are at higher risk than men.

AB Euthanasia is a complex medical procedure. Even though end of life decisions are common situations in health practice, there is a lack of consensus about their terminology. In this manuscript, the main concepts about this issue are defined and delimited; including active and passive euthanasia and limitation of therapeutic effort. Then, a revision is made about the international experience on euthanasia, to then go through the Chile's history in euthanasia and the population's opinion. In Chile, euthanasia is an act that has been removed from the social dialogue and legislation. In order to have an open discussion in our population about the issue, the debate has to be opened to the citizens, accompanied by clear medical information about the procedure.

AB Background: Worldwide, suicide is the third cause of death among adolescents. Aim: To determine the socio-demographic context and clinical characteristics of children and adolescents hospitalized for suicidal behavior in a general hospital. Material and Methods: Between 2007 and 2009, we evaluated 47 patients with a mean age of 15.3 years (87% women) admitted for suicidal behavior at the Clinical Hospital of the Catholic University of Chile. Demographic data of the participants were registered. Clinical interviews were done by a child and adolescent psychiatrist. Results: Fifty seven percent of patients lived with both parents. Fifty one percent had previous suicide attempts and 68% had a previous psychiatric treatment. The main trigger was a conflict with parents in 66%. The psychiatric diagnoses were major depressive episode in 74.5% and pathological development of personality in 43%. All suicide attempts were with drugs and 6.4% were associated with cuts. Seventeen percent of attempts were classified as medically serious and they were more common in older age groups. Non severe attempts were observed mainly in women (92.3%). Acetaminophen intake was recorded in 8.5% of cases. Admission to hospital increased in the final quarter of the year. High costs of hospitalization were observed associated to stays in high complexity units. Conclusions: The population studied shows a high incidence of prior suicidal behavior. Most of the studied patients had attempts that were not classified as serious. These occurred predominantly in women in all age ranges. Medically serious suicidal behavior is mainly observed in older adolescents. (Rev Med Chile 2012; 140: 751-762).

AB This article examines the relationship among bullying, individual's identity, and school performance in Chile. The results indicate that being a bully or a bully-victim increases the probability of being a low performing student. For the case of victims, our results suggest a heterogeneity according students' ability, decreasing academic achievement for students with below average ability, but increasing it for very high achieving students. We also found that students claiming to belong to a subculture characterized by a defiant attitude towards authority have lower academic achievement. Our results support anti-bullying policies and those attempting to promote student's identities associated with higher academic achievement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Adolescent; Parents; Risk factors; Suicide
AB Background: In Chile, there has been an increase in suicide rates from 1.1 to 2.6 per 100,000 among adolescents aged 10 to 14 years and from 4.4 to 8.9 per 100,000 among those aged 15 to 19 years Aim: To identify protective factors for suicidal ideation according to parenting styles, as described by Barber et al. Material and Methods: The relation between suicidal ideation and parenting styles was assessed in a random sample of 2,346 Chilean school attending adolescents aged 13 to 20 years old (59% women) from three cities: Antofagasta (Northern Chile, II Region), Santiago (Central, Metropolitan Region) and Concepcion (Southern, VIII Region). Participants were tested with the Chilean adaptation of the Cross National Adolescents Program (CNAP) Plus questionnaire developed by Barber et al. The relation between suicidal ideation and parenting styles was assessed using regression analyses. Results: Correlations between suicidal ideation and parenting styles were mostly significant, yet weak. High odds ratios were observed among parents who had a strong psychological control, inconsistent control, lack of expression of affection and covered marital hostility. Conclusions: High adolescent self-esteem, a good relationship with parents, psychological parental autonomy, expression of physical affection, social support and paternal monitoring were protective factors against suicidal ideation. (Rev Med Chile 2011; 139: 1529-1533).

AB The purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship between adolescent substance use and psychosocial distress indicators among 30,851 adolescents aged 11 to 16 in four countries (Philippines, China, Chile, and Namibia). Global School-Based Student Health Survey data from these countries provided information about frequency and lifetime use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs as well as items about early adolescents' feelings of loneliness, worry, hopelessness, suicide, and number of close friends. Overall, there were significant relationships between adolescent substance-use behaviors and a measure of "global" psychosocial distress for both boys and girls in all four countries and for four of the five items of psychosocial distress (often lonely, often worry, sad/hopeless, and having a suicide plan). The association between substance use and psychosocial distress was also consistent in both genders and across the four countries. These results have important implications for professionals who work with adolescent populations.

AB The article analyzes the act of giving death for political reasons (heteric-referred suicide) and the hunger strike as a process in which one is willing to lose his life for altruistic reasons. It is argued that both acts broaden and radicalize the terms that give meaning to political life and will be conceived as acts that subvert the state of affairs in the sphere of the polls. The text situates the reflection in Chile and in the historical present, some emblematic cases of hunger strikes are reviewed and the main conflict between autonomy and right to life; the place occupied by the body is relieved as the support of this form of protest. Finally, some conclusions are proposed that allow us to interpret the tension caused by these acts in the social order.

AB Background: Seasonal variations of sexual crime have been seldom studied in the world. Santiago, a city situated at 33 south latitude with a well defined four season climate, has a reliable forensic registry, providing a good opportunity for the assessment of seasonality in this type of crime. Materials and Methods: After studying monthly records of sexual abuse from the registry of the Servicio Medico Legal of Santiago between 1990 and 2001, a ratio of observed to expected monthly frequency was obtained, allowing the assessment of the seasonal character of the phenomenon. Results: A total number of 11,844 cases of sexual abuse were recorded during 12 years of the study. Statistically significant differences could be demonstrated between spring and autumn, with a peak in November and a nadir in June. Conclusions: A distinct seasonal pattern can be set forth for sexual abuse in Santiago, Chile. Copyright (c) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB This paper presents a study conducted on 709 Latin American undergraduates from four countries with different development levels (Nicaragua, El Salvador, Chile and Spain). The intention of this paper is to value the differences in the number and characteristics of stressful life events (SLE) suffered by the participants. Another purpose is to confirm the relation between SLE and suicidal conduct in Spanish cultural contexts, through the study of a multicultural sample of Spanish-speaking university students, and finally, to isolate the SLE that allow predicting a later suicidal conduct to a greatest extent. The information was collected by means of a self-applied questionnaire. The results indicate a greater presence of SLE among those who live in countries with lower development levels and among those who have attempted committing suicide. It is observed that the fact of having suffered certain SLE physical or sexual mistreatment, excessive alcohol or drug consumption and having left home during childhood or adolescence aid in the prediction of later suicidal conducts in the studied samples.

AB Background: Suicide is the second or third cause of death among Chilean teenagers aged 15 to 19 years. Aim: To evaluate familial risk factors associated to suicidal attempt in adolescents with a depressive disorder. Material and methods: Thirty two teenagers with depression, aged between 13 and 18 years, receiving psychological treatment in six public Mental Health Centers in Santiago and 32 fathers, mothers or tutors were evaluated. Beck's Depression Inventory and the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale (FACES III, family version) were applied to adolescents. Adults were evaluated by the Goldberg's General Health Questionnaire and the FACES III parents version. Results: No meaningful statistical association between adolescents suicidal attempt and family risk factors (family order, pressure of family stressors and parent's mental health), was observed. However, the was a significant association between suicidal ideation of teenagers, their familiar adaptability and suicidal ideation of close relatives. Conclusions: Suicidal attempt in this group of teenagers was associated with familial adaptability and suicidal ideation by close relatives. Therefore close relatives must be integrated to the prevention programs for adolescents' suicide (Rev Med Chile 2009; 137: 226-33)

AB Exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O-3) >= US EPA standards are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. The projection of 13.8 million AD cases in the US by the year 2050 obligate us to explore early environmental exposures as contributors to AD risk and pathogenesis. Metropolitan Mexico City children and young adults have lifetime exposures to PM2.5 and O-3, and AD starting in the brainstem and olfactory bulb is relentlessly progressing in the first two decades of life. Magnetite combustion and friction-derived nanoparticles reach the brain and are associated with early and progressive damage to the neurovascular unit and to brain cells. In this review: 1) we highlight the interplay environment/genetics in the AD development in young populations; 2) comment upon ApoE epsilon 4 and the rapid progression of neurofibrillary tangle stages and higher suicide risk in youth; and 3) discuss the role of combustion-derived nanoparticles and brain damage. A key aspect of this review is to show the reader that air pollution is complex and that profiles change from city to city with common denominators across countries. We explore and compare particulate matter profiles in Mexico City, Paris, and Santiago in Chile and make the point of why we should invest in decreasing PM2.5 to at least our current US EPA standard. Multidisciplinary intervention strategies are critical for prevention or amelioration of cognitive deficits and AD progression and risk of suicide in young individuals. AD pathology evolving from childhood is threating the wellbeing of future generations.

AB Objective: To identify clinical and sociodemographic factors that increase or decrease suicidal risk in a clinical sample of subjects seeking mental health care.
   Method: A cross-sectional study was performed at three health centers in Santiago, Chile. The Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI), Depressive Experience Questionnaire (DEQ), Outcome Questionnaire (OQ-45.2), Reasons for Living Inventory (RFL), and State Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI-2), in addition to a sociodemographic survey, were applied to 544 participants (333 with suicidal behavior and 211 without current suicidal behavior). Through hierarchical clustering analysis, participants were grouped by similarity regarding suicidal risk. Then, a regression analysis was performed using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) technique, and factors that decrease or increase suicide risk (SR) were identified for each cluster.
   Results: The resultant clusters were grouped mainly by the age of participants. The most important protective factor was having confidence in one's own coping skills in difficult situations. Relevant risk factors were major depressive disorder (MDD), poor anger management, and difficulties in interpersonal relationships.
   Conclusions: Suicidal risk manifests differently throughout the life cycle, and different types of bonds may protect from or increase risk of suicide.

SO REVISTA MEDICA DE CHILE

DE Ethics, medical; Euthanasia; Suicide, assisted
ID PASSIVE EUTHANASIA; LETTING DIE; SUICIDE
AB The Bill of Rights for Patients provides the patient with autonomy for disposing of his life, enabling him to reject those treatments that unnecessarily prolong his life. However, the bill does not allow an artificial acceleration of death. Therefore, the bill does not permit euthanasia (at least, certain form of it) nor assisted-suicide. However, according to the practice of medicine and also Chilean doctrine, it is permitted to inject morphine to a patient to relieve his pain, even though that could hasten his death. In consequence, it is allowed for the patient to dispose of his life and also to inject in him morphine for pain relief endangering his life, but neither euthanasia nor assisted-suicide is allowed. Is this coherent? According to Chilean doctrine, it could be coherent under the condition of accepting the distinction between killing and letting die and also the double effect doctrine. The problem is that there is abundant English literature in the realm of moral philosophy to disregard both conditions. Therefore, it is possible to claim that the Bill is not coherent and that the Chilean doctrine is based upon a distinction and a doctrine that are not acceptable. (Rev Med Chile 2011; 139: 655-659).

ID BEHAVIORS; VALIDITY
AB Introduction: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) deterioraton is a risk factor for suicide in adults, however, this aspect has been little studied in adolescents. Objective: To evaluate the association between HRQoL (measured with EQ-5D-5L) and suicidal risk in adolescents and its capacity for cross-sectional detection of suicidal risk. Patients and Method: 128 adolescents (15-19 years old) from Puerto Aysen (Chile) responded to the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, the Okasha Suicide Scale and two anchoring questions of imminent suicide risk. A suicide risk case was considered to have a > 5 score on the Okasha scale or the affirmative answer to one of the anchoring questions. The index value of EQ-5D-5L was calculated and Odds Ratios (ORs) were estimated with confidence intervals (95% CI), adjusted for confounders. Areas under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) were calculated to assess the discriminatory performance of EQ-5D-5L. Results: 21 (16.4%) adolescents were at suicidal risk. Controlling for confounders, the EQ-5D-5L dimensions associated with suicidal risk were pain/discomfort (OR: 2.5; 95% CI 1.1-6.1) and anxiety/depression (OR: 2.2; 95% CI 1.3-3.6). The AUC-ROC for both dimensions was 85% (95% CI 0.75-0.91) and 81% for the EQ-5D-5L index value (95% CI 0.72-0.89). Conclusions: HRQoL could be a risk factor for suicide in adolescents and in this way, the EQ-5D-5L could help in searching for high risk and hidden cases of suicidal risk.

ID AMERICAN ASSOCIATION
AB Background: Pesticides are widely used to increase crop yields and vector control. However, both acute and chronic exposure have health consequences. There is paucity of information about the global occurrence of pesticide poisonings. Aim: To characterize the reports of pesticide exposures received by a University Poison Information Center. Material and Methods: All pesticide exposures reported in Chile between 2006 and 2013 were analyzed. A data-collection sheet provided by the International Programme on Chemical Safety of the World Health Organization, was used to collect information. Results: In the study period, 13,181 reports were analyzed. The main age groups exposed were preschoolers and adults. Sixty one percent of exposures occurred accidentally and 24.8% were suicide attempts. Exposures to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors was reported in 29.3% of cases, to superwarfarin rodenticides in 28.5% and to pyrethroids in 24.0%. An increased risk of suicide attempts with pesticides was observed among women, when compared with men (odds ratio: 1.5; 95% confidence intervals: 1.4-1.6; p < 0.001). The risk was higher among teenage girls. Conclusions: The amount of cases under acetyl cholinesterase inhibitor exposure, the most toxic pesticides currently in use should be highlighted. Workers should be educated and all cases should be reported to take actions aiming at reducing these events.

AB IntroductionThe purpose of the present study is to compare the role of spiritual and religious beliefs in the prevention of suicidal risk among depressive women with suicidal ideation or attempts, treated in the psychiatric unit of a general hospital in Santiago de Chile (Servicio de Psiquiatria del Hospital del Salvador) between 2010 and 2011.
   MethodThe relationship among severity of depression, suicidal risk, and religiosity is explored in women treated in Servicio de Psiquiatria del Hospital del Salvador. The sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of believers (n=121) and nonbelievers (n=22) were compared, and their global mental health was assessed, as well as their rating in scales for depression, anxiety, aggressivity, and impulsivity.
   ResultsMost of the patients self-reported to belong to Catholic or other Christian churches. There were few statistically significant differences between them and nonbelievers, who were younger, had more years of education, were more frequently employed, and lived alone or with their parents. When comparing the least religious and the most religious quartiles, there were no differences in the type of affective disorder, attendance to temples, or self-appraisal of religiosity. Nonbelievers had more history of previous suicidal attempts and had more relatives committing suicide.
   DiscussionIn a country where most of the population is believer, self-reported religiosity seems to have a nonsignificant association with suicidality and severity of depression. Our results could be biased given the small number of nonbelievers in the sample.

AB Background: Suicidal behaviors and depression are prevalent phenomena among adolescents, and are considered a public health problem. Aim: To determine the prevalence of depressive symptoms and suicidal behaviors and the relationship between both phenomena, in a representative sample of students from ninth grade in Santiago, Chile. Material and Methods: We recruited a probability sample of 2,597 adolescents who answered a questionnaire with questions about suicidal behavior and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). Results: The lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation and planning was 21 and 14%, respectively. The prevalence for the past two weeks was 6.7 and 4.4% for suicidal ideation and planning, respectively. Autolytic behaviors, once in lifetime and in the past week were referred by 26 and 4% of respondents, respectively. In one third of these, self-harm coincided with recent suicide ideation or planning. All levels of suicidal behavior were more frequently reported by women. Clinically significant depressive symptoms were present in 23.5% of adolescents. Females doubled male rates. Severe depressive symptoms were present in 9.4% of the sample. A higher level of suicidal behavior correlated with more severe forms of depression. Sixty percent of adolescents who reported recent self-harm, had clinically relevant depressive symptoms. Two thirds of them had severe symptoms. Conclusions: Suicidal behavior in Chilean adolescents is prevalent, and there is an association between this behavior and the level of depression. The school is a good place to identify and develop preventive measures for teenagers. (Rev Med Chile 2012; 140: 873-881).

AB Aim: In efforts to develop reliable methods to detect the likelihood of impending suicidal behaviors, we have proposed the following.
   Objective: To gain a deeper understanding of the state of suicide risk by determining the combination of variables that distinguishes between groups with and without suicide risk.
   Method: A study involving 707 patients consulting for mental health issues in three health centers in Greater Santiago, Chile. Using 345 variables, an analysis was carried out with artificial intelligence tools, Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining processes, and decision tree techniques. The basic algorithm was top-down, and the most suitable division produced by the tree was selected by using the lowest Gini index as a criterion and by looping it until the condition of belonging to the group with suicidal behavior was fulfilled.
   Results: Four trees distinguishing the groups were obtained, of which the elements of one were analyzed in greater detail, since this tree included both clinical and personality variables. This specific tree consists of six nodes without suicide risk and eight nodes with suicide risk (tree decision 01, accuracy 0.674, precision 0.652, recall 0.678, specificity 0.670, F measure 0.665, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) 73.35%; tree decision 02, accuracy 0.669, precision 0.642, recall 0.694, specificity 0.647, F measure 0.667, ROC AUC 68.91%; tree decision 03, accuracy 0.681, precision 0.675, recall 0.638, specificity 0.721, F measure, 0.656, ROC AUC 65.86%; tree decision 04, accuracy 0.714, precision 0.734, recall 0.628, specificity 0.792, F measure 0.677, ROC AUC 58.85%).
   Conclusion: This study defines the interactions among a group of variables associated with suicidal ideation and behavior. By using these variables, it may be possible to create a quick and easy-to-use tool. As such, psychotherapeutic interventions could be designed to mitigate the impact of these variables on the emotional state of individuals, thereby reducing eventual risk of suicide. Such interventions may reinforce psychological well-being, feelings of self-worth, and reasons for living, for each individual in certain groups of patients.

TI Euthanasia, assisted suicide, and the principle of double effect. A
   reply to Rodolfo Figueroa
SO REVISTA MEDICA DE CHILE
LA Spanish
DT Article
DE Double effect principle; Euthanasia; Suicide; assisted
AB The purpose of this paper is to defend the traditional application of the principle of double effect as a criterion for assessing the permissibility of actions that have as their common aim to end the suffering of seriously ill patients. According to this principle, euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are always illicit acts, while the same is not said for other actions that bring about patient's death as a foreseen effect, namely, palliative treatments that hasten death or failure or interruption of life support. The reason for this difference is that, in the first two cases, the patient's death is intended as a means of pain relief; whereas, in the latter two, death is only a side effect of a medical act, an act justifiable if it is necessary to achieve a proportionate good. In a recent issue of this Journal, Professor Rodolfo Figueroa denied the soundness of the principle of double effect and maintained that all actions described above should be considered equivalent in law enforcement. Here, the author presents a reply to that argument, and also offers a justification of the afore said principle's core, that is, the moral and legal relevance of the distinction between intended effects and foreseen side effects.

AB Risk factors and behaviors among children and adolescents hospitalized for a suicidal attempt Background: Suicidal behavior is the result of the interaction of several factors and represents an increasing health problem. Aim: To characterize epidemiologically children and adolescents with suicidal attempts and compare them to a control group. Material and Methods: A case-control and prospective study, based on clinical interviews and tests performed to 30 children and adolescents hospitalized due to a suicidal attempt and their parents or tutors, (GIS) and 40 ambulatory controls without such history (CG). Psychopathological disorders, risk behaviors (substance use, maltreatment, peer violence, sexual abuse and early sexual relations), family factors and their association with suicidal attempts, were analyzed. Results: Seventy seven percent of participants with a history of suicidal attempt had psychopathological disorders (depression in 38%) and a higher prevalence of suicidal behavior, maltreatment, substance and sexual abuse. Male sex was a risk factor for suicide among children under 12 years and female sex was a risk factor for adolescents aged over 12 years. Other risk factors detected were a risky communication between parents and siblings. Conclusions: Children and adolescents who attempted suicide and their families have a higher prevalence of risk behaviors than the control group. (Rev Med Chile 2012; 140: 1417-1424).

AB The aim of this research was to evaluate the mediating effect of psychological distress, between internalized homophobia and suicidal risk in a sample of men belonging to sexual minorities in the city of Arica (Chile). The sample consisted of 157 men between 18 and 53 years of age (M=24.4, DT=5.49), recruited by availability and snowball technique. The Internalized Homophobia Scale, the Symptom Inventory and the Scale of Suicide Risk were applied. The results obtained account for a mediating effect of psychological distress between internalized homophobia and suicidal risk, that is, the suicidal risk increases when internalized homophobia and psychological discomfort as a third variable are included in the model. In conclusion, the importance of the reduction of internalized homophobia and psychological distress should be emphasized in psychosocial interventions with men of sexual minorities with the purpose of contributing to the development of their mental health.

AB Current methodologies employed in collecting data for suicide research present several limitations. In this article, we describe a novel method and tool to prospectively study suicidal behavior and its related risk and protective factors in different countries. This tool is a web-based database, which will initially be developed and piloted by suicide research groups from Austria, Brazil, Chile, France, Italy, Mexico, Spain, Sweden, and the US. The database will develop and integrate research tools key to collaboration, permit exploration of ethical considerations, and provide a universal interface in English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, and German that will make it possible to incorporate new groups from different countries to the network. The common database resulting of this cross-national effort will allow researchers to share and compare data across countries in a large sample of patients. Using anonymous electronic records of patients, we will: 1) determine the impact of risk and protective factors (viz. aggression and religious affiliation) in different socio-cultural environments; 2) develop a clinical model of suicidal behavior that integrates the multiple dimensions implicated; 3) try differentiating the effects of biological, environmental, and cultural factors on suicidal behavior, and 4) offer the global psychiatric research community a tool that will standardize assessment across nations, allowing for better generalization.

AB Background: Cocaine users tend to have a higher frequency of risk behaviors. Aim: To compare risk behaviors of out of treatment Cocaine Base Paste (CBP) and Cocaine Hydrochloride (CH) users, by means of Privileged Access Interviewing in a one-year prospective study. Material and Methods: Twenty eight interviewers were trained to recruit and administer a questionnaire on substance use patterns and related risk behaviors. Intentioned sampling was carried out in four municipalities of Santiago, Chile. Subjects who used CBP (group 1) or CH (group 2) at least once in the last month, with primary current use of CBP (group 1) or CH (group 2), and without treatment for substance abuse in the last six months were interviewed. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) were employed to compare risk behaviors during follow up. Results: Four hundred and two of 467 subjects (86.1%) were followed up for one year. CBP users (n = 204) reported greater frequency of self inflicted injuries (Odds Ratio (OR): 1.97 [95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.07-3.66]) and suicide attempts (OR: 2.68 [95% CI: 1.19-6.01]) than CH users. Conclusions: CBP users had a greater frequency of self inflicted injuries and suicide attempts, both life threatening risk behaviors, than CH users. This profile shows the high vulnerability of CBP users and should encourage further research and design of outreach interventions, particularly focused on this group.

AB The archaeological record of Rapa Nui (Easter Island, Chile) is noteworthy for its massive statues (moai) that were transported over long distances with relatively small numbers of people and minimal use of resources. Equally impressive are the colossal bodies of red scoria (pukao) placed on the heads of many of the moai. In this study, we use three-dimensional models of 50 pukao found across the island and 13 red scoria cylinders from Puna Pau, the island's pukao quarry, to study the process of pukao manufacture, transport, and placement atop statues. Our analysis identifies surface features that are explained by the process of construction and transport of these multi-ton objects. Based on shared physical features of pukao, evidence in the archaeological record, and the physics necessary for pukao movement, we propose a falsifiable hypothesis in which relatively small numbers of people rolled pukao up stone ramps to place pukao atop moai. We conclude that activities of pukao production and transport did not require oversight by a centralized political authority, nor do they support notions of a large population that collapsed with "ecological suicide" on Rapa Nui.

TI Informed consent in the patients' rights law
SO REVISTA MEDICA DE CHILE

DT Article
DE Ethics Committees; Euthanasia; Informed Consent
ID PASSIVE EUTHANASIA; DOCTRINE; SUICIDE; DIE
AB The new regulation of patients rights creates the right to informed consent, which allows accepting or refusing any medical treatment. Also, the patient has the right to be appropriately informed about a variety of aspects determined by the law Patient's autonomy has limits. Artificial acceleration of death, euthanasia or assisted suicide are not permitted. The problem is that the law does not define those situations. The law provides the intervention of Ethics Committees when the doctor considers that the patient exposes himself to severe harm or the risk of death which would be avoided. This intervention impinges on patient's autonomy Patients have the right to request discharge and medical facilities could discharge patients against their will if they do not accept medical recommendations. These limitations on autonomy should be explained because the law apparently makes the distinction between killing, letting die and the Double Effect Doctrine. There is plenty of literature questioning the validity of both. The law fails to regulate part of the medical practice, regarding life and death decisions. A lack of consensus could explain tins omission. Doctors have a right to conscientious objection to some patient's requests. (Rev Med Chile 2012; 140: 1347-1351).

DE Ethics; Enteral Nutrition; Hunger; Strikes; Employee
AB Every so often, in Chile there is a discussion about the role of physicians in the care of people on hunger strike (HS). In this document, we review the ethical aspects of health care for persons in HS, aiming to provide guidelines to medical doctors who are required to attend them. First, we make an important distinction between HS and suicide, since the former is used as a protest and denunciation tool, while suicide seeks deliberately to end a life. Then we describe the three roles that the health professional can fulfill: as a treating doctor, as an expert or as an official of a prison. The respect for the autonomy and dignity of the person in HS must prevail whatever the role of the physician. Therefore, we maintain that under no circumstances, people who have autonomously decided to be in HS should be fed by force. Due to the complexity of the issue, we make special considerations about the management of minors and the non-competent persons in HS. In conclusion, we adhere to the principles that inspire the Declaration of Malta, which indicate that it would be preferable to "allow a person on hunger strike to die in dignity, rather than subjecting them to repeated interventions against their will".

AB The Minority Stress Model (Meyer, 2003) has made it possible to explain how sexual prejudice produces negative effects on the health and wellbeing of people belonging to sexual minorities, through distal and proximal stressors. A qualitative study was conducted to investigate the effects of sexual prejudice on the mental health of transgender adults in Chile. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 transgender people, both male and female, in four cities of the country. The results allow us to identify the presence of distal factors associated with overt discrimination, as well as, proximal factors associated with the experience of stigma and its effects on self-concept. Finally, effects on mental health are described, among which the presence of anxious-depressive symptomatology, suicidal ideation and attempts, self-injurious behavior and consumption of alcohol and other substances.

AB Background: Depression is considered the second leading cause of disability worldwide. Aim: To describe the clinical characteristics and the evolution of major depressive disorder (MDD) in secondary care. To evaluate the association between socio-demographic and clinic variables with the first or recurrent major depressive events (MDE). Material and Methods: Clinical features, treatment, remission and duration of MDE were evaluated during a follow up lasting 12 months in 112 participants aged 44 +/- 15 years (79% women). Patients were assessed as outpatients every three months at three psychiatric care centers of Chile. Clinical interviews were carried out using DSM-IV diagnostic criteria checklists and the Hamilton Depression Scale was applied. Results: Most patients were referred from primary care. The mean time lapse for referral to the secondary level was 10.8 months. Most patients had episodes that were recurrent, severe, with a high rate of psychosis, with suicide attempts and melancholic features and with psychiatric and medical comorbidities. Remission rate was 27.5%. In only 16 % of patients, the episode lasted six months or less. The group with recurrent episodes had different age, sex and clinical features. Conclusions: MDD treated at the secondary care level is severe and its symptoms are intense. The time lapse prior to referral was prolonged. Primary care management and referral of these patients should be studied more closely.

AB Background: Adolescence is the most vulnerable development stage to stall drug abuse in our country. Moreover, adolescent personality may be an individual risk factor for drug abuse. Aim: To characterize the personality of adolescent drug abusers using the Million Adolescent Clinical Inventory (MACI) and its Chilean norms. Patients and methods: Adolescents consulting in a mental health facility were studied. MACI was applied to 46 subjects, aged 16 +/- 1 years (30 males) with a history of drug abuse and compared with 58 peers aged 15 +/- 2 years (34 males) without such history. Results: Male and female drug abuser adolescents had a transgressor type of personality. Males had a high degree of sociability and unrestrained sexuality while females present signs of sexual abuse, suicide risk, and a more severe personality disorder. Conclusions: The personality traits detected ill this group of drug abuser adolescents using Chilean norms is similar to those detected abroad and should help to plan rehabilitation (Rev Med Chile 2009; 137: 466-74)

With this purpose, I will develop three areas of clear impact: participation in scientific ethical review committees, development of academic programs in bioethics and research and publication on ethics and bioethics. My motivation to enter in the program was that this training links psychosocial research with ethics and bioethics, which allows me to apply this type of reflection to problems such as violence, suicide, addictions, depression and mental health, and new fields such as community studies with vulnerable or at risk populations, in which the diverse implications are difficult to inquire.

AB Background: International evidence has shown the complex interaction between depression and chronic physical diseases. Depression in scenarios involving multiple comorbidities has not received enough attention in Chile. Aim: To characterize the depressed people who consult at Primary Health Care Centers (PHCCs), taking into account the presence of chronic physical or psychiatric comorbidity. Materials and Methods: A secondary analysis of databases used in a clinical trial. Two hundred fifty six adults seeking professional help were recruited in four PHCCs located in the Metropolitan Region. These people had a major depressive episode, identified with a structured psychiatric interview (MINI), and gave their informed consent to participate. Socio-demographic information was collected, depressive symptomatology was measured with the patient health questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), psychiatric morbidity was assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), and chronic physical diseases were self-reported by the patients. Descriptive analyses of all the variables were conducted. Results: Seventy percent of patients had a history of depression, with a median of two prior depressive episodes. Depressive symptoms were mostly considered as moderate to severe and severe and 31% of the patients had high suicide risk. Seventy eight percent displayed a physical or psychiatric comorbidity. Of these patients, 29% only had a chronic physical comorbidity, while 46% suffered from an additional psychiatric disorder. Conclusions: Depressed individuals who seek help at PHCCs constitute an especially complex population that must be treated taking into account multiple comorbidities.

AB Background: Offspring of depressive parents have two times more risk of developing a depression, other psychiatric diseases or a poor social functioning. Aim. To assess psychopathology and social functioning among offspring of currently depressed mothers. Material and methods: We enrolled 290 depressed mother-child pairs in five primary-care clinics in Santiago. A two-stage screening process to identify female primary-care patients with current major depressive illness with children aged 6-16 years, was used. All eligible and consenting patients were asked to complete the general health questionnaire (GHQ-12). Those scoring 5 or more were invited to participate in a baseline assessment. The final sample consisted of 290 mother-child pairs. Patients with a current DSM-IV diagnosis of major depression were eligible unless they had current psychotic symptoms, imminent suicide risk history of mania, or current alcohol abuse. Child psychopathology was assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), a highly reliable and widely used parent-rated checklist to assess competencies and behavioural and emotional problems in children 4 to 18 years of age. Results: Fifty percent (95% confidence interval (CI): 43.9-55.7) of children had overall CBCL psychopathology scores in clinical range. Internalizing symptoms were more prevalent than externalizing symptoms (62.2% [95%CI: 56.3-67.8] and 35.7% [95%CI: 30.2-41.5]. Conclusions: A large proportion of children of depressed poor mothers attending primary care clinics in Chile, had psychopathological symptom, scores in the clinical range, with a predominance of internalizing symptoms. These results are similar to those previously reported in the United States of America (Rev Med Chile 2007, 135: 602-12).

AB When assessing a patient with depression it is crucial not to miss a diagnosis of bipolar depression. In this review we suggest that it can be achieved, first, by consistently using standardised diagnostic criteria (e.g. DSM-IV-TR or ID 10) and, second, by ascertaining the presence of some clinical features. The latter include previous episodes of mood elevation, current or past episodes of psychotic depression, onset of recurrent depressive disorder before the age of 25, a strong family history of mood disorder and suicide, lack of response or "wearing off" of response to well conducted antidepressant treatment, and an unusually fast response to antidepressants with features of elation. Although more and better research is required to establish the validity, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of each one of these features we suggest that from a practical point of view they would increase clinicians' awareness of bipolar depression.

AB Background. Previous mental health surveys conducted in prisons within emerging countries recruited samples of all prisoners at any single point in time. However, this sampling strategy results in an overrepresentation of long-term prisoners as compared with those studies recruiting from all admissions over time. This study aimed to assess mental disorders in consecutively admitted prisoners soon after admission, in order to address service needs of people with short-term imprisonments and people at early stages of imprisonment.
   Method. Disorders were assessed in a sample of 229 male and 198 female prisoners, consecutively committed to the penal justice system in Santiago de Chile, using the structured Mini-Neuropsychiatric interview. Prevalence rates were calculated as per cent values. Ninety-five per cent confidence intervals were calculated for the proportions.
   Results. Illicit drug and/or alcohol use disorders in the year prior to admission were present in 173 (76%) male and 64 (32%) female prisoners. The substances most frequently causing addiction were cocaine-based products in 108 (47%) male and 42 (21%) female prisoners. Current major depression was present in 124 (54%) male and 86 (43%) female prisoners, and current non-affective psychotic disorders in 18 (8%) male and in 10 (5%) female prisoners. High suicidal risk was present in 64 (28%) male prisoners and in 29 (15%) female prisoners.
   Conclusion. When consecutive prisoners are assessed at admission, rates of mental health and substance use disorders were higher than in previous studies in emerging countries that had sampled from all existing prisoners at a time. Affective disorders and suicide risk appear more prevalent than in admission studies conducted in Western high-income countries. Previous research may have systematically underestimated the extent of mental health problems in prisoners, which poses a major public health challenge in emerging countries.

AB Background: First longitudinal studies in prisoners point to improvements of depressive symptoms during imprisonment. The aim of the present study was to assess the course of major depressive disorder during imprisonment and to identify factors influencing remission.
   Methods: Prisoners with major depressive disorder in a sample of consecutive admissions to the penal justice system in Santiago de Chile were reassessed after one year of imprisonment. Psychiatric diagnoses were established using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview; psychological symptoms were assessed with the Symptom-Check-List 90 Revised (SCL-90-R). Mean symptom scores were compared at baseline and follow-up using Student's t-test. Odds ratios (OR) of comorbid disorders and socio-demo-graphic factors at baseline to predict depression at follow-up were calculated.
   Results: N=79 out of 80 inmates (99%) with major depression at baseline were included. Thirty-five prisoners (44%) had major depression at follow-up. The mean global severity score and all mean subscale scores of the SCL-90-R improved. High suicide risk was present in 37 prisoners (47%) at admission and in 11(14%) at follow-up. The comorbid diagnosis of PTSD (OR 6.3; p < 0.001) at admission and having been previously imprisoned (OR 2.5; p =0.05) predicted major depressive disorder at follow-up.
   Limitations: The study could not account for temporary improvements between the assessments.
   Conclusion: In spite of important symptom improvements, only about half of the prisoners with major depression at admission remit after one year of imprisonment. New interventions should target people with major depression and comorbid PTSD at admission. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Seedless grapes are generally preferred by consumers for fresh consumption. The development of new seedless selections utilizing stenospermy, has been recognized as a key factor in Vitis vinifera breeding programs throughout the world. The Department of Fruit Tree Breeding and Genetic at the Volcani Center is actively involved in breeding of early and late seedless grapes. Special emphasis is given to the time of ripening, firmness, high sugar content, special aromas, loose and uniform bunches, natural big berries, good shelf life and reduced labor costs. We utilized advanced techniques for embryo rescue and hardening in order to improved the efficiency of our cross hybridization program.
   Several years ago we have developed, registered and released for commercial growth several new selections. Some of these cultivars were found to be rather promising: Results obtained from the testing of "Prime", "Mystery", Spring Blush and "Black-finger" under different climatic conditions in Chile, South Africa and Israel are presented. The role of the seeded East-European cultivar "Yantar" in the inheritance of early ripening will be discussed.
   In parallel to the conventional breeding studies, we have established a biotechnological approach for the improvement of table grapes.
   Using seed-coat and embryo specific promoters we have overexpressed the egg avidin in transformed grapes. Ablation of seeds indicated that avidin can be utilized successfully as a suicide gene.

AB Background: In Chile, cocaine base paste (CBP) is the illegal substance that produces the highest rate of addiction. Nonetheless, a marginal number of users receive treatment each year. Aim: To compare the consumption patterns and risk behavior of CBP and cocaine hydrochloride (CH) users who do not attend rehabilitation services. Material and Methods: In a prospective research design, through a study methodology called Privileged Access Interview of hidden populations, 28 surveyors recruited 2,31 CBP users (group 1) and 236 CH users (group 2). The Risk Behavior Questionnaire was applied in four communities of Metropolitan Santiago, that have the highest prevalence of PBC and CH use. Results: CBP users showed higher schools drop-out and unemployment rates. Subjects of both groups were predominantly polysubstance and polyaddicted users. The severity of addiction to CBP of group 1 was significantly higher than the severity of addiction to CH of group 2 (5.5 versus 5.1: p<0.001). CBP users showed significantly higher rates of sexual risk behaviors, antisocial behavior, self infliction of injuries, suicide attempt and child neglect. Conclusions: A higher vulnerability was shown for users of CBP than those of CH. Attention is drawn to the need for developing community interventions in order to alter substance abuse and the risk behavior of these vulnerable groups.

AB The aim of the study was to explore the relationship between religion involvement (RI) and quality of life (QoL) in patients with schizophrenia from three countries in Latin America, while considering key confounding factors such as socio-demographic and clinical characteristics.
   This cross-sectional study was conducted in the public mental health services in La Paz, Bolivia; Arica, Chile; and Tacna, Peru. The data collected included RI, socio-demographic information, clinical characteristics, type of treatment and QoL using the S-QoL 18 questionnaire. A multivariate analysis using multiple linear regressions was performed to determine variables associated with QoL levels.
   Two hundred and fifty-three patients with schizophrenia were enrolled in our study. Significant positive associations were found between RI and QoL (the S-QoL 18 index: beta = 0.13; p = 0.048; autonomy dimension: beta = 0.15; p = 0.027). Other socio-cultural and economic factors were also associated with low QoL level: being a woman, older patient, low education level and being Aymara. Severity of the psychotic symptoms was associated to a lower QoL for all the dimension (beta from 0.15 to 0.31), except for the resilience.
   Our study found that socio-cultural and economic factors including RI were associated with QoL in patients with schizophrenia in Latin America, suggesting that these factors may influence positively health outcome. However, these relationships were moderate in strength, especially in comparison to symptoms severity which remained the most important features associated with QoL.

AB Background: Depression is common among women, specially during breeding. Aim: To characterize post-partum depression in a group of women attending a primary health care clinic and its relationship to quality of life. Material and methods: The sample included women meeting criteria for Major Depression, with a child of up to 11 months old. Exclusion criteria included the presence of psychosis, history of mania, alcohol abuse, illegal drug use, high suicide risk, and receiving mental health care in the last three months. Structured interviews used were the Edinburgh postpartum depression scale (EPDS), Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), Medical Outcomes Study Questionnaire (SF-36) and questions about incapacity and health care use. Results: The sample included 159 women with a median age of 27 years (range: 1643 years). Thirty three percent were married, 30.8% lived in common law marriage, 9.4% were divorced, and 26.4% were single. Most (89.3%) were housewives, 31% were students, and 6.9% were employed. The average score on the EPDS was 17 points (S.D. 4.2). The average SF-36 somatic score was 42.7 points (S.D. 8.2), and the emotional score was 30.3 (D.S. 0.3). The relation between the average score on the EPDS and the somatic and emotional scores was statistically significant (p=0.000-0.006). Conclusions: Most women were mildly to moderately depressed. Their depression was associated with a marked impairment of activities of daily living. These findings add to the evidence suggesting that depression is associated with marked disability cultures, even when the depression is mild to moderate.

AB Background: In the treatment of depression, primary care teams play an important role, whose effectiveness improves when inserted into a collaborative model of disease management. Aim: To report the results of a clinical trial carried out to test the effectiveness of a collaborative program between primary health teams and specialists supported by an electronic platform. Material and Methods: Physicians from four community hospitals belonging to the Reloncavi Health Service network, recruited 81 patients with depression aged 37 to 43 years, 84% of whom were female. Participants were divided in an active group, which participated in the collaborative program and a control group, which received the usual care, according to the Ministry of Health's Guidelines for Depression. The main outcome was the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-I) score at three months of intervention. Results: Participants had an average of 29.6 points (95% CI: 27.6-31.6) in the BDI-I and 38% of them had a high suicide risk. There were no statistically significant baseline differences between active and control group. In the intervention group, the BDI-I score changed from 30.0(95% C127.0 to 32.8) to 15.3 (95% CI 11.8 to 18.8). In the control group the score changed from 29.2 (95% CI: 26.4 - 31.9) points to 20.8 (95% CI 16.8 to 24.7). The decrease was significantly higher in the intervention groups. Conclusions: A program of this kind may be useful to assist primary care teams in remote areas of the country to improve treatment outcomes for depression.

AB Objective To compare the drowning mortality rates and proportion of deaths of each intent among all drowning deaths in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries in 2012-2014.
   Design A population-based cross-sectional study.
   Setting 32 OECD countries.
   Participants Individuals in OECD countries who died from drowning.
   Main outcome measures Drowning mortality rates (deaths per 100000 population) and proportion (%) of deaths of each intent (ie, unintentional intent, intentional self-harm, assault, undetermined intent and all intents combined) among all drowning deaths.
   Results Countries with the highest drowning mortality rates (deaths per 100000 population) were Estonia (3.53), Japan (3.49) and Greece (2.40) for unintentional intent; Ireland (0.96), Belgium (0.96) and Korea (0.89) for intentional self-harm; Austria (0.57), Korea (0.56) and Hungary (0.44) for undetermined intent and Japan (4.35), Estonia (3.70) and Korea (2.73) for all intents combined. Korea ranked 12th and 3rd for unintentional intent and all intents combined, respectively. By contrast, Belgium ranked 2nd and 15th for intentional self-harm and all intents combined, respectively. The proportion of deaths of each intent among all drowning deaths in each country varied greatly: from 26.2% in Belgium to 96.8% in Chile for unintentional intent; 0.7% in Mexico to 57.4% in Belgium for intentional self-harm; 0.0% in nine countries to 4.9% in Mexico for assault and 0.0% in Israel and Turkey to 38.3% in Austria for undetermined intent.
   Conclusions A large variation in the practice of classifying undetermined intent in drowning deaths across countries was noted and this variation hinders valid international comparisons of intent-specific (unintentional and intentional self-harm) drowning mortality rates.

AB Objective: This multicenter study estimated the prevalence of bipolar disorder (BPD) among emergency department (ED) patients in Latin America. Methods: To identify patients with BPD, a combination of DSM IV-criteria interview and the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) was used. Data from 1,505 patients from hospitals in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico was analyzed. Results: The prevalence of BPD in this sample was 5.2% (95% CI = 4.5% to 6.9%). Themean age was 37 years (response rate of 83.0%). Compared to non-BPD patients, BPD patients were more likely to report asthma (16.7% vs. 9%), thyroid problems (12.8% vs. 5.8%), seizures (23.1% vs. 3.0%), obesity (39.7% vs. 26.9%), alcohol abuse (30.8% vs. 10.0%), attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (50.0% vs. 12.0%), depression (81.6% vs. 45.7%), obsessive compulsive disorder (20.1% vs. 3.0%), panic disorders (23.1% vs. 12.3%), phobic disorders (11.2% vs. 3.1%), and any anxiety disorder (82.1% vs. 41.8%; all p <= 0.05). Suicidal plans and attempts were also significant higher in the bipolar group (11.5% vs. 2.8% and 10.3% vs. 1.8% respectively). Multivariate analysis identified ADHD, depression, alcohol abuse, anxiety disorder, and last month suicide plans and attempts to be independently associated with BPD. Conclusion: Our study supports that BPD is prevalent in ED in Latin-American countries and that comorbidity is the rule, not the exception. Patients presenting at ED with irritability, anxiety, pressure speech, euphoria, with suicidal tendencies, involved in risky behaviors, alcohol abuse, dependence or those with history of mental health hospitalization in the past 12 months must be assessed for comorbid BPD.

TI Ethnicity, self reported psychiatric illness, and intake of psychotropic

   SUICIDE; HEALTH; SENSE; POPULATION; DISORDERS
AB Study objective-This study hypothesises that the presumed increased risk of self reported longstanding psychiatric illness and intake of psychotropic drugs among Iranian, Chilean, Turkish, and Kurdish adults, when these groups are compared with Polish adults, can be explained by living alone, poor acculturation, unemployment, and low sense of coherence.
   Design-Data from a national sample of immigrants/refugees, who were between the ages of 20-44 years old, upon their arrival in Sweden between 1980 and 1989. Unconditional logistic regression was used in the statistical modelling.
   Setting-Sweden.
   Participants-1059 female and 921 male migrants from Iran, Chile, Turkey, Kurdistan and Poland and a random sample of 3001 Swedes, all between the ages of 27-60 years, were interviewed in 1996 by Statistics Sweden.
   Main results-Compared with Swedes, all immigrants had an increased risk of self reported longstanding psychiatric illness and for intake of psychotropic drugs, with results for the Kurds being nonsignificant. Compared with Poles, Iranian and Chilean migrants had an increased risk of psychiatric illness, when seen in relation to a model in which adjustment was made for sex and age. The difference became non-significant for Chileans when marital status was taken into account. After including civil status and knowledge of the Swedish language, the increased risks for intake of psychotropic drugs for Chileans and Iranians disappeared. Living alone, poor knowledge of the Swedish language, non-employment, and low sense of coherence were strong risk factors for self reported longstanding psychiatric illness and for intake of psychotropic drugs. Iranian, Chilean, Turkish and Kurdish immigrants more frequently reported living in segregated neighbourhoods and having a greater desire to leave Sweden than their Polish counterparts.
   Conclusion-Evidence substantiates a strong association between ethnicity and self reported longstanding psychiatric illness, as well as intake of psychotropic drugs. This association is weakened by marital status, acculturation status, employment status, and sense of coherence.

AB Background. Increasing reports of Pneumocystis DNA in noninvasive respiratory specimens from immunocompetent asymptomatic adults and the characteristic lung tropism of Pneumocystis suggest that asymptomatic pulmonary infections with Pneumocystis occur after primary infection. However, studies searching for Pneumocystis in the autopsied lungs of healthy immunocompetent adults have not met with success.
   Methods. Lungs of people who died of violent causes (accidents, homicide, and suicide) and of nonviolent causes (diseases causing a rapid demise in the street) in Santiago, Chile-for whom an autopsy was legally required were examined for Pneumocystis by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) DNA amplification of the mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal RNA-specific P. jirovecii gene and immunofluorescent microscopic analysis. Lung tissue concentration methods and analysis of similar to 3% of the weight of the right upper lobe (RUL) were needed to reach the sensitivity threshold of the assays. Individuals determined to be P. jirovecii negative after analysis of 3% of the RUL weight in the violent death group were confirmed to be negative by analyzing additional tissue, totaling 6%-7% of the RUL weight.
   Results. P. jirovecii was identified by nested PCR in 50 (64.9%) of 77 individuals (34 [61.8%] of 55 in the violent death group and 15 [78.9%] of 19 in the nonviolent death group; P > .05) and additionally by microscopic analysis in all individuals who tested positive for P. jirovecii DNA in the violent death group. Analysis of tissue beyond 3.0% of the RUL weight for the individuals who tested negative yielded consistently negative results.
   Conclusions. A mild P. jirovecii pulmonary infection is prevalent in more than half of the general adult population. Our results strengthen the concept that immunocompetent adults develop frequent self-limited reinfections throughout life and participate in the circulation of P. jirovecii as an infective reservoir for susceptible individuals.

AB Background
   Data on the course of mental disorders during imprisonment are scarce. Longitudinal studies from high-income Western countries point to improvements of symptoms over time. The aim of the present study was to assess mental disorders and symptoms three years after baseline evaluation at imprisonment and to determine predictors of change in a South American prison context.
   Methods
   Consecutively admitted prisoners in Santiago de Chile were assessed at intake and reassessed after three years using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and the Symptom-Check-List 90 Revised (SCL-90-R). The global severity index (GSI) was calculated with standard deviations (SD) and compared using paired t-tests. The prevalence of mental disorders at baseline and at follow-up were compared using McNemar tests. Analyses of variance were conducted to evaluate whether prespecified socio-demographic variables and disorders at baseline predicted symptom change at follow-up.
   Results
   73 (94%) out of 78 prisoners participated. The prevalence of major mental illnesses was lower at follow-up: 47 (64%) at intake vs. 23 (32%) at follow-up had major depression (p<0.001); 22 (30%) at intake vs. 10 (14%) at follow-up had psychosis (p = 0.008). The mean GSI improved from 1.97 (SD 0.65) at intake to 1.16 (SD 0.82) at follow-up (p<0.001). Depression at baseline (F = 9.39; eta(2)(p) = 0.137; beta = -0.67; p = 0.003) and working or studying during imprisonment (F = 10.61; eta(2)(p) = 0.152; beta = -0.71; p = 0.002) were associated with strong improvement of the GSI at follow-up, whereas psychosis at intake was associated with relatively small symptom improvement (F = 12.11; eta(2)(p) = 0.17; beta = 0.81; p = 0.001).
   Conclusions
   In a resource poor prison context in South America, mental health symptoms and disorders improve considerably over three years during imprisonment. This applies especially to people with depression at intake. Offers to work or study during imprisonment may improve mental health outcomes.

AB Introduction: Adolescent depression is associated with serious consequences. School staff is in a unique position to screen and refer adolescents with depression in a timely manner, and can collaborate with healthcare teams to assist in the proper management of the disease. The objective of this paper is to describe the results of a workshop that aims to improve the knowledge of adolescent depression among school staff.
   Materials and methods: This was a single-arm trial with a pre-post design. Six workshops were conducted in four cities in Chile. Each workshop lasted 4 h. Participatory methodology was used. A 26-item knowledge questionnaire about adolescent depression, with the alternatives "I agree," "I disagree," and "I don't know," was administered to the participants, before and after the workshop.
   Results: A total of 152 people participated in the trial. Of these, 74.3% were female, and 44.7% were school psychologists, 25.0%, teachers, 17.8%, school counselors, and 5.3%, social workers. On average, there were 69.6% (SD 21.3) correct responses on the initial test, and 91.8% (SD 8.0) on the final test. All items had an increase of correct answers and a decrease of "don't know" answers. There were notable increases of correct responses on statements dealing with myths: "Antidepressants for the treatment of depression in adolescents must be avoided because they produce dependence" (59-96%), and "Depression in adolescence is better defined as a weakness of character than as a disease" (75-95%). School psychologists scored higher than the other participants on the questionnaire both before and after the workshop.
   Conclusion: The workshop: "Adolescent depression: What can schools do?" can improve school staff knowledge of this topic, especially aiding to dispel myths regarding the disease and its treatment. This can help bring about timely case detection and improved collaboration with health team for proper handling of adolescent depression.

Impact of sunlight on the age of onset of bipolar disorder. Bipolar Disord 2012: 14: 654663. (c) 2012 The Authors. Journal compilation (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Objective: Although bipolar disorder has high heritability, the onset occurs during several decades of life, suggesting that social and environmental factors may have considerable influence on disease onset. This study examined the association between the age of onset and sunlight at the location of onset. Method: Data were obtained from 2414 patients with a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, according to DSM-IV criteria. Data were collected at 24 sites in 13 countries spanning latitudes 6.3 to 63.4 degrees from the equator, including data from both hemispheres. The age of onset and location of onset were obtained retrospectively, from patient records and/or direct interviews. Solar insolation data, or the amount of electromagnetic energy striking the surface of the earth, were obtained from the NASA Surface Meteorology and Solar Energy (SSE) database for each location of onset. Results: The larger the maximum monthly increase in solar insolation at the location of onset, the younger the age of onset (coefficient= -4.724, 95% CI: -8.124 to -1.323, p = 0.006), controlling for each countrys median age. The maximum monthly increase in solar insolation occurred in springtime. No relationships were found between the age of onset and latitude, yearly total solar insolation, and the maximum monthly decrease in solar insolation. The largest maximum monthly increases in solar insolation occurred in diverse environments, including Norway, arid areas in California, and Chile. Conclusion: The large maximum monthly increase in sunlight in springtime may have an important influence on the onset of bipolar disorder.
