AB The suicide mortality rates in Mexico have risen steadily over the past two decades as in the rest of the world. This has led to consider suicide as a health problem that must be analyzed from a multidimensional approach to examine the socio demographic characteristics of suicide to generate preventive measures for this problem and try to decrease the incidence of suicide, which currently is in the top three causes of death in the country. This paper aims to present an overview about the trend of suicide in Mexico of the period 1990-2011 and show the general characteristics of suicidal behavior in the country and the possible factors influencing the high rates of suicide.

TI Suicide in Mexico
SO PAPELES DE POBLACION
LA Spanish
DT Article
DE suicide; mortality; public health; demography; social change
AB This article aims to provide an overview of suicide in Mexico since the 1950's. Suicide implies an extreme form of violence against the self. It has profound social implications, as those who commit suicide have reached an existential condition in which taking their own life is seen as the only possible solution to their situation. Increases in overall rates of suicide probably pinpoint some kind of broader social process, and indeed suicide can be seen as an epidemic problem which is not being adequately addressed. During the last 50 years suicide in Mexico has increased amongst young and elderly males. At the same time, rates of accidental death and homicides have decreased (with the exception of the last five years). It could be said that the "civilizing process" in Mexico has advanced in the sense that we kill each other less than we used to, but for some reason rates of suicide have not accordingly declined. However, Mexico displays lower rates of suicide than other countries with similar rates of socioeconomic development. All this makes us think of the specific economic and social factors which have led to an increase in suicide since 1950 in Mexico.

TI Suicide notes in Mexico:: What do they tell us?
SO SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
AB According to international and Mexican official statistics, there is a dramatic rise in suicide in Mexico; however, research in this area is severely limited. This is the first study of suicide notes from Mexico in the international literature. From a population of 747 registered suicides, a sample of 106 note-writers and 106 non-note writers was examined. Using the demographic (descriptive) scheme of Ho, Yip, Chiu, and Halliday (1998), the results indicate that note writers do not differ greatly from other suicides. The less educated understandably wrote fewer notes. The most intriguing finding was that suicide in Mexico was associated with an array of factors, notably interpersonal problems.

AB Objective. This study sought to investigate suicide notes drawn from Mexico and the United States (US) as these countries share geographical proximity, but markedly different cultures and suicide rates. Material and Methods. A theoretical conceptual analysis of 102 suicide notes drawn from these countries, matched for age and sex, was undertaken based on a thematic model of suicide developed by Leenaars,(1,2) across countries. Results. The inter-judge reliability was adequate (.86 coefficient of concordance). Conclusions. The results suggested that there are more psychological commonalities than differences. Yet, as this study marks the first one using suicide notes, between Mexico and the USA, much greater study is warranted.

AB Objective: To analyze sex differences in demographic and clinical characteristics of individuals who died by suicide in Mexico City.
   Method: Statistical analysis of residents of Mexico City whose cause of death was suicide, during two years period from January 2014 to December 2015, with a coroner's report. Suicide mortality rates were calculated by age, sex, and location within the city. The Chi-squared test was used to assess statistical differences.
   Results: From January 2014 to December 2015, 990 residents of Mexico City died by suicide (men: 78.28%, women: 21.72%). Among males, the highest mortality rates were among the groups of 20-24 and 75-79 years old, whereas in women, the group with the highest mortality rate was 15 to 19 years old. 74% of the sample used hanging as suicide method. However, men had higher rates of a positive result in the toxicology test (40%) (p < 0.05). There was no concordance between male and female suicide by city jurisdictions.
   Conclusion: Our results provide evidence that the characteristics of Mexico City's residents who committed suicide had significant sex-related differences, including where they used to live. Understanding the contributory factors associated with completed suicide is essential for the development of effective preventive strategies.

AB The objective of this study was to analyze the burden of disease due to suicide in Mexico using years of life lost (YLL) between 2000 and 2012 by sex, age group (for those under 85 years of age) and jurisdiction. Vital statistics on mortality and population estimates were used to calculate standardized mortality rates and years of life lost due to suicide. Between 2000 and 2012 a sustained increase in the suicide mortality rate was observed in Mexico. The age group with the highest rate was 85 years of age or older for men, and 15-19 years of age for women. The highest impact in life expectancy due to suicide occurred at 20 to 24 years of age in men and 15 to 19 years of age in women. The states with the highest mortality due to suicide were located in the Yucatan Peninsula (Yucatan, Quintana Roo and Campeche). Mortality due to suicide in Mexico has increased continually. As suicides are preventable, the implementation of health public policies through timely identification, integral prevention strategies and the detailed study of associated risk factors is imperative.

AB Although many suicide prevention programs focus on youth suicides, data indicate the vast majority of suicides occur among adults (18-64 years). In 2005 New Mexico joined the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Violent Death Reporting System, collecting data on suicides, homicides, and unintentional firearm fatalities to better inform state and national prevention programs. We utilized data collected by the New Mexico Violent Death Reporting System in its first 2 years of operation (2005 and 2006) in order to define the demographic patterns of adult suicides in the state and characterize risk factors. A total of 526 suicides occurred among adults during this time, with the majority being male (78.5%) and White non-Hispanic (56.7%). The highest incidence was in adults between 45 and 54 years (28.1%). Firearms were the most commonly used mechanism, and "current depressed mood" the most commonly identified risk factor. High rates of adult suicide indicate the need for targeted prevention programs.

AB The relationship between alcohol use prior to suicide was explored among American Indian decedents in New Mexico for the years 1980 through 1998. The suicide data were collected from New Mexico Vital Statistics and toxicology reports from the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator and matched on a case-by-case basis. Detailed analyses were undertaken for all cases of resident New Mexico Indians from the Navajo, Pueblo, and Apache cultures. Alcohol was detected in 69% of all suicides of American Indians with some variance by major tribal cultural groups (range = 62.1% to 84.4%). This is higher than in suicides among the overall New Mexico population (44.3%). The mean blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of the drinking Indian decedents at suicide was 0.198 ( +/-SD of .088). Mean BACs were high for both males (0.199) and females (0.180) who had been drinking. Over 90% of the Indian decedents who had been drinking had BACs greater than the legal intoxication level of 0.08. The Navajo had the lowest percentage of cases that were alcohol involved, and their mean BAC was lower than the other two cultural groups. Alcohol use for completed suicides also varied somewhat by age, sex, method of suicide, and place of occurrence, but very little by whether the decedent was an on or off reservation resident. Analyses indicated that alcohol use prior to suicide was significantly more associated with male suicides than for females, and it was negatively correlated for those who died by overdose and also those using other drugs at suicide. Otherwise, alcohol use did not significantly differentiate American Indian suicides by age, use of firearms, hanging, use of other methods, or residence, for the presence of alcohol was a factor very commonly associated with all of these variables. Heavy alcohol consumption is, therefore, an important factor in over two thirds of all completed suicides among the Indians of New Mexico.

AB Objective. To summarize the epidemiology of completed suicide and suicidal behavior in Mexico. Material and Methods. National data registries on mortality from the year 1970 to 2007 and cross-sectional surveys were used to analyze suicide mortality and suicidal behavior. Results. The suicide rate grew 275% from 1970 to 2007. Suicide has been increasing among Mexicans 15-29 years old since 1970. In adults aged 18-29 years the lifetime prevalence of ideation was 9.7%, and attempt 3.8%. About 6,601,210 Mexicans had suicidal thoughts, 593,600 attempted suicide and 99,731 used some sort of medical service as a direct consequence of the latter in the year prior to the survey. Conclusions. Suicide and suicide-related behaviors are significant public health problems and, as such, actions are urgently required to identify and treat persons with suicidal thoughts, assess suicidal risk in patients with psychiatric disorders and implement population interventions.

DE Suicide; mortality; life expectancy; Colombia; Mexico
AB Introduction: Suicides are one of the main public health issues globally.
   Objective: To analyze the trends and impact of suicide mortality in Colombia and Mexico between 2000 and 2013, nationally, by sex and age groups.
   Materials and methods: Mortality vital statistics from the Colombian Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadistica and the Mexican Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia were used. We conducted a descriptive and cross sectional study for which we calculated standardized mortality rates and years of life lost in people between 0 and 100 years of age.
   Results: In Colombia, the suicide mortality rate decreased between 2000 and 2013 for both sexes (28% for men and 38% for women); an opposite trend was observed in Mexico (with an increase of 34% for males and 67% for females). In 2013, the years of life lost in Colombia were 0,32 among men and 0,15 among women, with a decreasing trend since 2000, whereas in Mexico a level of 0,42 was observed in men and 0,2 in women, with an increasing trend since 2000. The age groups where suicides had a bigger impact were those of men 15 to 49 years of age in both countries, while suicides were more uniformly distributed among women between 15 and 84 years of age.
   Conclusions: Suicide mortality increased gradually in Mexico, whereas in Colombia an opposite trend was observed. Suicides can be prevented, so it is fundamental to implement public health policies focused on timely identification, comprehensive prevention strategies and the study of associated risk factors.

AB Although suicidal behavior in children and adolescents is a major public health problem, large-scale research on suicide in this population is uncommon. In this study, we reviewed autopsy and field reports for all pediatric suicide cases referred to the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator from 1979 to 2005. The age-adjusted suicide rate was 4.8 per 100,000. Psychologic stressors and parasuicidal behavior were identified in some cases. Seventy-six percent of suicides occurred in the victim's home or yard, and 25% left a suicide note. In 26% of cases, alcohol or other drugs were detected in postmortem. Gunshot wound was the most common method overall (58%), followed by hanging (30%). Although the age-adjusted suicide rate is higher in New Mexico than nationally, the trends in the population are similar. With a solid understanding of the circumstances, it may be possible to predict, and hopefully prevent, future cases of child and adolescent death.

TI Death and the City: Female Public Suicide and Meaningful Space in Modern
   Mexico City
SO JOURNAL OF URBAN HISTORY
LA English
DT Article
DE suicide; gender; public space; Mexico City
AB Poised on the cusp of the twentieth century, many urban citizens believed their societies to be sickened by suicide epidemics. It was assumed that rapid modernization and technological advance caused some individuals to develop nervous conditions that negated their impulses for self-preservation. Although statistical evidence pointed to higher rates of suicide among adult men, society believed that youth and women were most vulnerable to the epidemic. This article examines cases of young women carefully planning their suicides in symbolic spaces of Mexico City. It argues that public suicides made self-conscious decisions on how they would die, in particular choosing the sites of their deaths for their cultural meanings. How society viewed their deaths depended upon their virtue in life; nevertheless, Mexicans perpetuated their culture of commemorating the dead by erecting ephemeral memorials at the sites of death.

AB Objective. To provide updated information regarding the 12-month prevalence and associated sociodemographic factors for suicide ideation and behavior (plan and attempts) to substantiate preventive programs in Mexico. Materials and methods. Cross-sectional nationally representative survey, conducted during 2016 (n=56 877) among those 12-65 years old living in rural, urban and metropolitan dwellings. Results. The prevalence of suicide ideation in the last 12-months was 2.3%, 0.8% of the sample reported a plan and 0.7% reported a suicide attempt.All three outcomes were about two times more common among females and suicide plan and attempt were less common among the elderly (50-65 years old). Suicide attempts were more common in urban than in rural areas.The state of Tabasco showed an increased prevalence of ideation, plan and attempts when compared to national average rates. Conclusions. Public health measures to diminish and treat suicidal behavior are urgently needed all over the country.

TI The growth of suicide ideation, plan and attempt among young adults in

AB Aims. Low and middle income countries share a heavy burden of suicide with about three in every four suicides occurring in these countries. Mexico has witnessed a growing trend in suicide deaths; if this trend is not simply a reflection of better reporting of suicide on death certificates, then this increase should logically be accompanied by an increasing trend in suicide ideation, plan and attempts, but we lack information on the trends for suicide ideation, plan and attempt for this period. We therefore aim to report changes for suicidal behaviour for the period 2001-2013 in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area.
   Method. Using two cross-sectional surveys conducted in Mexico in 2001 and 2013, we report the lifetime and 12-month prevalence of suicide ideation, plan and attempt and changes in treatment for these problems among respondents aged 19-26 living in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area 12 years apart. To estimate the changes in prevalence for each outcome, we used generalised linear models to calculate prevalence ratios (PR; the prevalence rate in the exposed (year 2013) divided by the prevalence rate in the unexposed (year 2001-2002), adjusting for sociodemographic variables.
   Results. While increases in the prevalence are noted everywhere, statistical comparisons only found differences for lifetime ideation (PR = 3.1; 95% CI = 1.7-5.8) and a borderline difference for suicide attempt (PR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.0-4.9). No attempt within the last 12-months was reported in 2001, but the prevalence in 2013 reached 1.5% (18 cases). While PRs for 12-month prevalence were all above the null, none reached statistically significant differences. During this 12-year period, the distribution of mental disorders and the use of services for mental disorders among suicide ideators, planners and attempters did not change in any noticeable way.
   Conclusions. The limitations of our data are the small number of participants in the 2001 survey, the low follow-up rate for the survey in 2013 and that while representative from one city it does not represent the whole country. These findings suggest that suicide ideation and attempt may have increased during this 12-year period in the Mexico City metropolitan area, but this increase did not lead to more use of mental health care services. This information, coupled with the long-term trend of increasing suicide death rates in the country, draw a worrisome and neglected scenario for our youth in this region. Urgent measures, following the recent WHO guidelines for suicide prevention, must not be postponed.

ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; WEATHER; MORTALITY; FLUCTUATIONS; IMPACT
AB Linkages between climate and mental health are often theorized but remain poorly quantified. In particular, it is unknown whether the rate of suicide, a leading cause of death globally, is systematically affected by climatic conditions. Using comprehensive data from multiple decades for both the United States and Mexico, we find that suicide rates rise 0.7% in US counties and 2.1% in Mexican municipalities for a 1 degrees C increase in monthly average temperature. This effect is similar in hotter versus cooler regions and has not diminished over time, indicating limited historical adaptation. Analysis of depressive language in >600 million social media updates further suggests that mental well-being deteriorates during warmer periods. We project that unmitigated climate change (RCP8.5) could result in a combined 9-40 thousand additional suicides (95% confidence interval) across the United States and Mexico by 2050, representing a change in suicide rates comparable to the estimated impact of economic recessions, suicide prevention programmes or gun restriction laws.

AB Suicide rates in Mexico have been rising steadily for several decades. This study examined the relationship of depressed mood and antisocial behavior problems with thoughts of death, suicide plans and attempts. Data from 22,966 individuals who participated in a population-based nationally-representative survey in Mexico were analyzed. After adjusting for covariates, all odds ratios for thoughts of death and suicidal behaviors were statistically significant in relation to antisocial behavior problems and depressed mood, both moderate and severe. Multiplicative effects of depressed mood and antisocial problems were found, with comorbid individuals showing increased risk of thoughts of death and suicidal plans and attempts, compared to individuals displaying none. Possible explanations, particularly for the multiplicative effect of both mood and problem behaviors on suicide-related behaviors, are discussed in the context of prior findings and directions for future research.

TI Understanding Suicide in Socially Vulnerable Contexts: Psychological
   Autopsy in a Small Town in Mexico
SO SUICIDE AND LIFE-THREATENING BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
AB In Mexico, suicides are increasing in certain latitudes where local rates have grown to levels of alert; suicide is also the second most common cause of death for the group aged 15 to 19. The psychological autopsy method was utilized to uncover and analyze common factors in all of the registered suicides within 2011 and 2012 in a small town of the state of Guanajuato, located in the center of Mexico. A total of nine decedents were analyzed, and 22 interviews were conducted. The most salient factors were as follows: poverty, financial stress, substance abuse, low levels of education, conflictive relationships, and a poor handling of emotions. The concepts of social exclusion and vulnerability were employed to analyze suicides as symptoms of a much deeper problem of this country, suggesting that anomie and social malady are nowadays important suicidal factors, mostly for children and young people.

AB BACKGROUNDYouth suicide is a serious public health problem in the United States. School environments, and the attention of school adults, are promising but minimally studied avenues for promoting mental health among students.
   METHODSThe 2013 New Mexico Youth Risk and Resiliency Survey data were analyzed to identify ways in which the school environment influences suicide attempts in a sample of Hispanic students. Factors examined were: relationships with school adults, speaking a language other than English at home, being born outside the United States and not having enough to eat. Odds ratios were used to measure relationships.
   RESULTSFactors influencing suicide attempt were similar for boys and girls. The odds of suicide attempt declined by approximately one third as measures of positive relationships with school adults increased. Post-high school education plans also were protective. Being born outside the United States and not having enough to eat increased the odds of past-year suicide attempt. Speaking a language other than English at home was a weak risk factor for suicide attempt only among Hispanic girls.
   CONCLUSIONSTeachers and other school adults can decrease suicide risk for Hispanic teens by forming supportive relationships with students. Special consideration should be given to providing free breakfast in schools.

AB This is an analysis of the results of several studies performed in different populations of Mexico on suicide ideation and attempts, in which different methods and measurement instruments were used. Most of these studies were representative samples of household and students surveys, and studies at clinical settings. The highest prevalence of suicide attempt was 10%. The highest prevalence of suicide ideation was 40.7%. Important differences were found according to the instruments used to measure suicidal behavior in the time frame and in the cut-off points used for defining cases.
   These analyses, give precise information on ideation and suicide attempts in the Mexican population, which is important for designing policies. Unified criteria will provide better registers on both suicide ideation and attempts.

DT Article
DE Maya; suicide; Ix Tab; Yucatan (Mexico); iconography
ID IDENTITY; POLITICS; YUCATAN
AB Ix Tab, the ancient Maya suicide goddess, appears in various settings in the contemporary popular culture of Yucatan, Mexico. In a state where the suicide rate is double the Mexican national average, discourses about Ix Tab feed misconceptions about indigenous proclivities to suicide and render Maya people exotic. In an effort to unravel the origins of Ix Tab and the contemporary beliefs about indigenous suicide, we studied the ethnohistoric origins of Ix Tab in Diego de Landa's Relacion de las cosas de Yucatan and reviewed iconography from art databases and more than forty-four hundred pages of published works to identify either an ancient Maya suicide deity or suicide by hanging as a motif in ancient Maya art. Our research found no iconographic evidence of a suicide deity, and we came upon only two images of humans hanging by the neck, neither representing suicide. This indicates that there was no ancient Maya suicide deity and that suicide by hanging was not a significant motif among the ancient Maya.

ID ALASKA NATIVE YOUTH; PREVENTION; COMMUNITIES
AB Objective: To examine correlates of suicide attempts among American Indian adolescents living on reservations in New Mexico. Design: Cross-sectional
   Participants: American Indian adolescents attending school in New Mexico, grades 6 to 12.
   Main Outcome Measures: Data from the Search Institute Profiles of Student Life Attitudes and Behaviors survey related to suicide attempts and student assets and risk behaviors. Hypothesized predictor variables derived from 39 survey questions were tested against one outcome variable relating to prior suicide attempts.
   Results: Of 690 American Indian students included in the study, 24.2% indicated having attempted suicide one or more times in their lives. Salient assets included having neighbors who cared about them, adults who made them feel important, and having friends who did well in school. Notable risk factors were feeling depressed, drug and alcohol use, and having been the victim of violence.
   Conclusions: Adolescent suicide continues to be a major concern for American Indians. A focus on strengthening parent-child relationships and community support for families may increase resiliency among youth at risk.

AB To better understand the changing toxicology trends in suicidal drug overdoses in the setting of an increased national trend of multidrug overdoses, a retrospective review of electronic records from New Mexico's Office of the Medical Investigator database was performed between 2008 and 2012 to assess the drug type and current risk factors in suicide deaths. Information on demographics, circumstances, suicide risk factors, toxicology findings, and death certificates was collected and analyzed. Three hundred and forty-two suicide cases of suicide overdoses were identified. Decedents were predominantly female (61.8%). Scene investigation revealed risk factors including suicide ideation (47.4%), previous suicide attempts (38%), and suicide note (38%). Psychiatric illness was present in 72% of cases, with depression being the most common illness. Chronic pain was seen in 27.2% of cases. Most deaths were attributed to multiple drugs (76%). Utilizing the toxicology information will assist in creating public awareness and provide a framework to support targeted efforts to attempt to prevent future suicides.

AB Objective. To determine the association between substance use and the number of substances with the presentation of suicide. Material and Methods. Data were taken from the forensic certificate of the Epidemiological Surveillance System of Addictions in the period between 1994 and 2006 from 27 states in Mexico. Results. Suicide was detected in 8.7% of the violent deaths during the study period. Among men, it was observed that the increased number of substances increased the possibility for death by suicide, compared to deaths from other causes (one substance: OR = 1.8; two or more: OR = 3.3). In women, that possibility remains virtually unchanged with the increase in the number of substances detected (one substance: OR = 3.2; two or more: OR = 3.6). Discussion. The use of substances is a major factor associated with suicide in the population whose cause of death was issued by the Mexican Forensic Medical Services.

AB Background: Worldwide, the suicide rate is decreasing. To examine changes in the rates of completed suicide in the Mexican population from 2003 to 2012, we analyzed these changes according to: (i) the method of suicide; (ii) age group and (iii) gender. Methods: The data analyzed were obtained from governmental organizations from the State of Tabasco, Mexico. The data provided 1836 cases of subjects born and residing in Tabasco, who completed suicide in this state. Results: Suicide by hanging was a common choice of suicide method for Mexicans. The rate of suicide by hanging increased from 5.80 to 6.49 per 100,000 persons between 2003 and 2012, a rate percentage increase of 11.89%. Conclusions: Hanging was found to be the most common choice of suicide in the Mexican population, probably because the materials required are easily available and the method does not require complicated techniques, especially in the 55-64 age group. Strategies for prevention and intervention should be developed for the Mexican population considering suicide rates by age group and gender.

AB Attempted suicide is the main risk factor for completed suicides. Objective: To analyze the prevalence of attempted suicide in junior high school and high school students in Mexico City, and its associated factors. Subjects and Method: Observational, cross-sectional and descriptive study conducted with data from the Mexico National Survey on Drug Use Among Students (ENCODE) 2012. The validated survey was anonymous, structured and self-applied, and contains seven sections: Sociodemographic; Tobacco, alcohol and drug use; Problems related to drug use; Antisocial behavior; Social sphere; Interpersonal sphere and Personal sphere. Family atmosphere, communication with parents, and self-esteem indexes were created using principal component analysis. A binomial logistic regression model was adjusted, and the odds ratio (OR) were analyzed. Results: The estimated prevalence of attempted suicide was 6.8%. The factors that increased the attempted suicide possibility were: being a woman (OR 3.1), be under 16 years old (OR 1.6), living in an unfavorable family atmosphere (OR 1.5) or having a poor communication with parents (OR 1.8), having low self-esteem (OR 1.9), behavioral or learning problems (OR 1.4) or suffering a mental illness (OR 3.6); having been forced into sexual contact (OR 2.6); or drugs use, smoking or alcohol consumption (OR 1.7, 1.2 and 1.7). Conclusions: The attempted suicide prevention should be focused on women younger than 16 years, with any psychiatric disorder, behavioral problem or low self-esteem, who live in an unfavorable family atmosphere, with risky behavior such as smoking, or alcohol or drugs consumption, or who have been forced into sexual contact.

AB Suicide is a significant health problem, yet many questions regarding suicide remain unanswered. One of the most frequently asked questions is related to motive: "Why did that person complete suicide?" We explored motivations for completing suicide, especially with regard to cultural differences, by analyzing suicide notes written by Native Americans, Hispanics, and Anglos in New Mexico. Five categories emerged describing motivation: feelings of (a) alienation, (b) failure or inadequacy, (c) being psychologically overwhelmed; (d) the desire to leave problems behind, and (e) reunification in an afterlife. The largest difference to emerge between ethnic groups was in the alienation category, which included more Hispanics and Native Americans than Anglos. The overall lack of differences in motivation among the ethnic groups suggests that commonalities in suicidal behavior outweigh the differences. Practical implications for research and practice are discussed, along with strengths and limitations of the study.

AB While it is recognized that veterans have increased rates of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), suicide, and substance use disorders, rates of homicide and unintentional injury deaths in veterans have been minimally investigated. We evaluated all non-natural deaths in New Mexico veterans between 2002 and 2011 in comparison with non-natural deaths among non-veterans. We reviewed all decedents in New Mexico with a history of military service and investigated by the medical examiner, excluding natural deaths and deaths due to fall from standing height. The most common manner of death was unintentional injury (62%), most of these deaths due to motor vehicle accidents (29%) followed by unintentional overdose (26%). Suicide rates among veterans were consistently higher than the general population. The most common mechanism of suicide in men was gunshot wound (72%), and intentional overdose in women (49%). Services are needed for veterans that are tailored to all ages and both sexes.

AB Objective. To develop a risk index of suicide attempts in the last 12 months among people with suicide ideation. Materials and methods. Cross-sectional study. Data came from the National Addictions Survey 2008. The risk index was made up by age, marital status, religion, occupation, area of the country in which they live, immigrant to the United States, alcohol and drug consumption, depression symptoms, behavioral problems and a history of sexual abuse. Results. We found a monotonic relationship between the increase in risk factors and the existence of a plan and the risk, with an odds ratio over 2.07 up to 152.19. The area under the curve is quite high, with a value of 0.844, very close to 1. Conclusion. The use of this index may help prevent patients from further developing their suicide ideation process and may prevent a suicide attempt of uncertain consequences, including death.

AB Background Suicide in Mexico has risen steadily in recent years, increasing by 156% in the last two decades. The study of suicide precursors, such as suicide attempts, has also become an important public health topic. The aim of this study is to establish the prevalence of suicide attempts in a general hospital setting and its association with alcohol, depression, and other factors.
   Methods. A cross-sectional survey of a sample of patients was carried out in all three service units (inpatient, outpatient, and the emergency room) of a general hospital in Mexico City. All patients were randomly selected to participate regardless of the reason for initial hospital admission. Each patient was administered a series of psychological and demographic scales including the Beck Depression Inventory, the Beck Hopelessness Inventory, the General Health Questionnaire, a suicide assessment scale, a scale for alcohol consumption, and several measurements of alcohol-related problems.
   Results. The final sample was made up of 1,094 patients of both genders (68% women), aged 18-65 years. A lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts of 6.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] of 4.7-7.7%) was found. Multiple logistic regression was used to obtain estimations of the association between lifetime suicide attempt and other factors. Marital status, age, depressed mood, hopelessness, Goldberg's 30-item version of the General Health Questionnaire, and high levels of alcohol consumption were all associated with the suicide attempt.
   Conclusions. Prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts was mainly related to being young, divorced, or widowed, and to feeling depressed, hopeless, and under undesirable psychological distress. (C) 2000 IMSS. Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

This article reports findings from a qualitative study in Mexico exploring the Mental Health Facilitator (MHF) program, a population-based curriculum created to respond to global mental health needs, and address mental health care disparities and the resulting burden in international communities. The present study explores experiences of individuals trained in the MHF curriculum (facilitators) and those who have received services and care from those trained as facilitators.

AB Available data on mental health among female sex workers in Mexico are scarce. The scarce evidence shows that the prevalence of depression and suicidal problems is much higher than in the general population. The objective of this article was to explore the psychosocial factors associated with depression and suicide risk in a sample of 103 sex workers from the state of Hidalgo, Mexico. Among them, the frequency of depression and suicide risk was higher than for women in the general population (39.8% and 3.0%, respectively). The variables that predicted these illnesses were a bad relationship with the mother, the negative health effects due to alcohol use, partner violence, and sexual violence. It is necessary to consider these results to promote actions that reduce or eliminate partner violence, promote the acquisition of skills to manage the negative consequences of violence and implement strategies to reduce the harm caused by alcohol consumption in this vulnerable group of the population.

AB Objective. To describe the epidemiologic pattern of acute pesticide poisoning (APP) in a general hospital in Merida, Yucatan, Mexico. Material and methods. From 1994 to 1998, 33 patients 13 years of age or older with diagnosis of APP were studied. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze information. Results. Males were frequently affected (82%), specially those coming from rural areas (60%). The mean age of the group was 34 +/- 15.8 years. In 79% of the cases, pesticides were used to commit suicide and 33% of poisoning cases were due to organophospate pesticides. The mortality rate was 12%. Conclusions. In this small sample, acute poisoning from pesticides in the agricultural setting may be underestimated, since it was less frequent than in the general population. APP was more commonly used by indigent people to commit suicide.

AB This study used an ecologic design based on data from 1990 to 1994 gathered from forensic, vital statistic, census, law enforcement and liquor licensing agencies to assess the relationship between liquor outlet density and alcohol-related health outcomes in New Mexico. Linear regression models show that suicide, alcohol-related crash, and alcohol-related crash fatality (adjusted for age, sex, and minority status) are significantly associated with liquor outlet density. Data also show that, compared with the first tertile, suicide and alcohol-related crash rates increase about 50% and the alcohol-related crash fatality rate two-fold with the third tertile of liquor outlet density. Greater availability of liquor outlets is associated with higher rates of suicide, alcohol-related crash, and alcohol-related crash fatality. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB In the mid-1990s Mexican states began adopting reforms that for the first time criminalized domestic violence. Two separate policies were also adopted which allowed domestic violence to be grounds for divorce and established prevention and assistance programs for victims of domestic violence. I exploit the variation in time and geography to estimate the impact of these three policies on female suicide rates using a difference-in-difference methodology. The results indicate that states that criminalized domestic violence exhibited a 22-34% decrease in suicide rates compared to non-adopting states, but there is no robust evidence that the other two policies had any impact. A battery of tests provides support for the robustness of these findings and indicates that most of the effects are concentrated among married women. Analysis of a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey covering violence against women in Mexico suggests reduction in sexual and physical violence as a possible mechanism behind the reduction in female suicide rates. These findings are consistent with an intra-household bargaining model with asymmetric information and costly conflict which predicts that policies that reduce conflict within the household can reduce female suicides. The results highlight the importance of developing and implementing policies that facilitate reporting and providing access to legal institutions for victims of domestic violence, which can in turn improve a victim's wellbeing.

AB Introduction
   Mexico has seen constant increases in the rate of completed suicide in the last decades, especially among youth. The Mexican population between 15-24 years of age is currently the most affected, with 28% of all suicides in 2007. In this context of increasing suicide mortality, the study of suicide-related behaviors, that is, suicidal ideation, plans, gestures and suicide attempts, has special relevance. All of these are immediate precursors to death by suicide and independent risk factors of subsequent suicide attempts and completed suicides. Episodes that do not result in death, can lead to serious, long-term consequences in one's physical health, as well as being an important cause of psychological suffering on the part of the individual and his/her family. Up until now, research in our country has emphasized the prevalence of lifetime suicidal behavior and its associated factors. However, the current (12-month) prevalences are indispensable in order to define the demographic profile and clinical needs, and to build risk profiles for immediate application by the clinics treating these individuals.
   Objectives
   To report the prevalence and sociodemographic characteristics of suicide-related behaviors in the past 12 months in a nationally representative sample of respondents from the Encuesta Nacional do Adicciones (ENA) of 2008.
   Methods
   Cross-sectional prevalence study which obtained data from a nationally-representative sample of 22 966 individuals, between the ages of 12 and 65, during 2008, who answered the section on suicidal behaviors. The response rate was 77%. Twelve-month prevalences; of suicidality are reported according to different sociodemographic and economic factors. Multiple logistic regression models for odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, corrected for the study design, are reported.
   Results
   We found the prevalence of any suicidal ideation to be 8.79% (ranging from 4.2 to 6.2%, depending on the question used), the prevalence of a suicide plan was 1.22%, and 0.79% of the sample reported to attemp suicide within the past 12 months, with the prevalence of suicide attempts that required medical attention being 0.13%. If we use the sample weights to make estimations regarding the 75 million inhabitants of Mexico that the ENA 2008 represents, we estimate that 6 601 210 Mexicans experienced suicidal ideation in the post 12 months, 918 363 Mexicans planned suicide, a total of 593 600 individuals attempted suicide and 99 731 utilized medical services as a consequence of their attempt. We found that women, people who are not married or in a relationship, those with less education, younger age groups and the unemployed have, in general, a higher risk of exhibiting suicidal behavior. Some regions of the country, especially the southeast, were more affected, whereas individuals who live in rural areas consistently reported lower prevalences of the three suicidal behaviors.
   Conclusion
   The epidemiology of completed suicide in Mexico has changed within the last decodes by a process that has been gradual but constant. The epidemiology of current suicidal behaviors shows that the problem is already at similar levels to other highly affected countries. Mexico needs immediately to dedicate much more efforts to detection, treatment and prevention of these behaviors to avoid further increases in suicidality and its consequences.

AB The objective of this study was to estimate the extent to which parental psychopathology may confer increased risk of suicide ideation and attempts among their offspring in Mexico. Data from a representative sample of 5,782 respondents participating in the Mexican National Comorbidity Survey (20012002) to examine the unique associations between parental psychopathology and offspring suicidality were used. Parental disorders (major depression, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, substance dependence, and antisocial personality disorder) were comorbid and after controlling for comorbidity and number of disorders only parental panic and antisocial personality disorder remained associated with ideation and attempts in the total sample. Those with more parental disorders were at increased risk of ideation and attempt, as well as increased risk to transition from suicide ideation to an attempt. These findings may help inform clinical and public health efforts aimed at suicide prevention in Mexico and other developing countries.

AB The main objective was to analyze the level, trend and impact of mortality by external causes in Colombia and Mexico between 1998 and 2015. The years of life lost were calculated for people younger than 85 years of age and their trend was estimated using a joinpoint regression analysis. The decomposition of life expectancy by cause of death and age groups was also calculated. In Colombia a significant decrease was observed in all the analyzed external causes of death; in Mexico, the increase of mortality by homicides and the continued rise in suicides reversed their declining trend. Mexico presented a higher mortality due to external causes than Colombia, which clearly shows the divergent trends in both countries.

   Methods Death certificate data were analyzed; using multivariable binary logistic regression to determine associations.
   Results National suicide death rates ranged from 1.4 % (Mexico) to 6.4 % (South Korea). The proportion of suicide deaths occurring at home was high, ranging from 29.9 % (South Korea) to 65.8 % (Belgium). Being older, female, widowed/separated, highly educated and living in an urban area were risk factors for home suicide.
   Conclusions Home suicide deaths need specific attention in prevention programs.

Using data from the New Mexico version of the 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Youth Risk Behavior Survey, we found that positive relationships with adults affected past-year suicide attempts differently in youth from the 3 groups. The final multivariable model for American Indian/Alaska Native youth included only positive relationships with adults in the home. Among Hispanic and Anglo youth, adults in the home and also in the community were protective.

ID CASE-CROSSOVER
AB The association between air pollution and suicide has recently been under examination, and the findings continue to be contradictory. In order to contribute evidence to this still unresolved question, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the association between air quality and daily suicides registered in Mexico City (MC) between 2000 and 2016. Air quality was measured based on exposure to particulate matter under 2.5 and 10 micrometers (mu m) (PM2.5 and PM10, respectively), ozone (O-3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2), adjusting for weather variables (air temperature and relative humidity), and holidays. To this end, an ecologic time series analysis was performed using a Poisson regression model conditioned by time and stratified by gender and age groups. Models were also generated to explore the lagged and accumulative effects of air pollutants, adjusted by weather variables. The effects of the pollutants were very close to the null value in the majority of the models, and no accumulative effects were identified. We believe these results, in this case, no evidence of a statistical association, contribute to the current debate about whether the association between air pollution and suicide reported in the scientific literature reflects an actual effect or an uncontrolled confounding effect.

AB Purpose: To examine suicide mortality trends among young people (10-24 years of age(1)) in selected countries and territories of the Americas.
   Methods: An ecological study was conducted using a time series of suicide mortality data from 19 countries and one territory in the Region of the Americas from 2001 to 2008, comprising 90.3% of the regional population. The analyses included age-adjusted suicide mortality rates, average annual variation in suicide mortality rates, and relative risks for suicide, by age and sex.
   Results: The mean suicide rate for the selected study period and countries/territory was 5.7/100,000 young people (10-24 years), with suicide rates higher among males (7.7/100,000) than females (2.4/100,000). Countries with the highest total suicide mortality rates among young people (10-24 years) were Guyana, Suriname, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Chile, and Ecuador; countries with the lowest total suicide mortality rates included Mexico, Venezuela, Cuba, and Brazil, and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. During this period, there was a significant increase in suicide mortality rates among young people in the following countries: Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, and Suriname; countries with significant decreases in suicide mortality rates included Canada, Colombia, Cuba, El Salvador, and Venezuela. The three leading suicide methods in the Americas were hanging, firearms, and poisoning.
   Conclusions: Some countries of the Americas have experienced a rise in adolescent and youth suicide during the study period, with males at a higher risk of committing suicide than females. Adolescent and youth suicide policies and programs are recommended, to curb this problem. Methodological limitations are discussed. (C) 2014 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

AB Objective: Using the method of psychological autopsy, we identified differences by gender in socio-demographic aspects, signs and symptoms, and suicide characteristics in a population of the state of Tabasco. Mexico.
   Methods: Between the years 2007-2014, 182 psychological autopsies were documented by the Secretary of Health of the State of Tabasco, Mexico. A structured questionnaire was used to obtain information on socio-demographic aspects and suicide characteristics.
   Results: The sample was mainly formed by males (78%). 84% of the sample used hanging as suicide method. However, in comparison with the male group, females were older on the average (p = 0.002); they were mostly housewives (37.5%) and had more years of schooling (p = 0.004). Other significant differences predominantly present in the male group were: the use of alcohol at the time of suicide (52.1%), job retirement, and increases in apathy (50.7%) and aggressiveness (36.6%) (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that there are differences by gender between subjects with completed suicide. Factors such as alcohol consumption, job retirement, aggressiveness and isolation/social apathy certainly render men more vulnerable to suicide in the Mexican population.

LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH; POLICY
AB This study examined the 2013 New Mexico Youth Risk and Resiliency Survey (NM-YRRS) to determine whether cultural connectedness and positive relationships with adults protected against suicide attempts among American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth and whether these relationships differed by gender. The sample included 2,794 AI/AN students in grades 9 to 12 who answered the question about past-year suicide attempts. Protective factor variables tested included relationships with adults at home, school, and the community. The language spoken at home was used as a proxy measure for cultural connectedness. Positive relationships with adults were negatively associated with the prevalence of past-year suicide attempts in bivariate analysis. However, language spoken at home was not associated with the prevalence of suicide attempts. Multivariate analysis showed that among girls, relationships with adults at home, at school, and in the community were independently associated with lower suicide-attempt prevalence. Among boys, only relationships with adults at home showed such an association. These results have important implications for the direction of future research about protective factors associated with AI/AN youth suicide risk as well as in the design of suicide intervention and prevention programs.

AB Introduction
   During the last decade, an increase in children and adolescents' completed suicide has been reported nationally and internationally. Psychiatric disorders, family circumstances and sociocultural influences are associated risk factors.
   Objective
   To describe suicidal tendency in children and adolescents during 1998-2011 in Mexico.
   Method
   National Data Health Records on mortality in children and adolescents younger than 20 years between from the year 1998 to 2011 were analyzed. Rates and indices were calculated using population projections from the National Population Council. The Truncated Trend of Standardized Mortality, change rate and the Years of Life Lost Index were calculated.
   Results
   In the 5 to 19 year group population, the completed suicide deaths accounted for 7% of the external cause injuries; the male-female ratio was 2.2:1. Overall, the tendency increased from 18.5 to 31.9 by 10(6). Hanging was the method most often employed. The percentage of change was greater in women with 6%. The county with the highest trend was Hidalgo with 17.2%. In 2011, Tabasco was the county with the highest index of years lost by suicide with 67%.
   Discussion and conclusion
   The increase in completed suicide in the adolescent's group, the hanging method, the low socioeconomic status and the problems with the registry's death system are data that have also been reported by other authors. The suicide mortality trend has increased. Hanging was the preferred method nationally. A deficient recording system remains an unresolved issue.

AB Nationally representative data from the Mexican National Comorbidity Survey are presented on the lifetime prevalence and age-of-onsct (AOO) distributions of suicide ideation, plan and attempt and on temporally prior demographic and DSM-IV psychiatric risk factors. Lifetime ideation was reported by 8.1% of respondents, while 3.2% reported a lifetime plan and 2.7% a lifetime suicide attempt. Onset of all outcomes was highest in adolescence and early adulthood. The risk of transition from suicide ideation to plan and attempt was highest within the first year of onset of ideation. The presence of one or more temporally prior DSM-IV/CIDI (Composite International Diagnostic Instrument) disorder was strongly related to each suicide-related outcome. Suicidal outcomes are prevalent, have an early AOO, and are strongly related to temporally prior mental disorders in Mexico. Given the early AOO, intervention efforts need to focus more than currently on children and adolescents with mental disorders to be effective in prevention.

AB No representative data among adolescents in Mexico exist on the prevalence and risk factors for suicide ideation, plan, and attempt despite a recent increase in suicide deaths. Method: Data are presented from the Mexican Adolescent Mental Health Survey, a representative household survey of 3,005 adolescents ages 12 to 17 in metropolitan Mexico City who were gathered in 2005, regarding lifetime prevalence and age-of-onset distributions of suicide ideation, plan, and attempt and demographic and psychiatric disorders risk factors. Results: Lifetime ideation was reported by 11.5% of respondents, whereas 3.9% reported a lifetime plan and 3.1% a lifetime suicide attempt. Onset of suicidality started around age 10 and at age 15 showed the highest hazards. Suicide ideators were more likely to report a plan and attemptwithin the first year of onset of ideation. Suicidality was more likely to occur among females. The presence of one or more mental disorders was strongly related to suicide ideation, plan, and attempt. Among ideators only dysthymia was consistently related to a plan and attempt. Conclusions: Intervention efforts should focus on assessment and target adolescents with mental disorders, particularly mood disorders, to be effective in prevention.

SO SALUD MENTAL

ID DELIBERATE SELF-HARM
AB According to census data, Mexico is a country of children and youths. In 1995, 39% of the population was under 14 years old and 29.6% was between 15 and 29 years old. So, this population, ranging from 0 to 29 years, represented two thirds of the total population of the country (68.2%).
   The capital of the country, Mexico City, concentrated 9.3% of the total population, and the proportion of children and young students is obviously considerable, so that researching their needs in the mental health field turns into a priority.
   In several countries of the world, it has been recognized that suicide among adolescents is a public mental health problem, and Mexico is not an exception in this sense.
   The main question here is knowing how frequent the problem is among adolescent students. Unfortunately, official health records do not specifically distinguish this feature, because they only report statistics according to gender and age, but not according to population type (such as students).
   Because of that, it is highly important to create systematic and periodic registers that allow for the detection and monitoring of tendencies from an epidemiologic perspective. Detecting risk groups and identifying risk and protective factors is highly important in order to deal with the adolescent suicide problem.
   Taking into account two measurements, carried out in 1997 and 2000, the aims of the present study are:
   1. To identify the prevalence of suicide attempts in Mexico City according to the following indicators: political delegation,* gender, educational level (junior high school, high school, and technical high school), and type of school (public or private),
   2. To describe suicide attempt characteristics in men and women according to: number of times (to distinguish between single attempts and recurrent suicide behavior [two or more times]), age at the moment of the attempt, main motive and methods used, and lethality indicators.
   To carry out the sampling, we randomly selected schools from each of the 16 political delegations of Mexico City. The design of the sample was stratified, bi-staged and by conglomerates. The stratification variable was the educational level: junior high school, high school, and technical high schools.
   At the first stage, the unit of selection were the kind of schools and, in the second stage, the school level group.
   The final sample for the 1997 study was made up of 10,173 students and that for the 2000 study was of 10,578 students.
   To inquire about suicide attempt and its characteristics, previously evaluated indicators were applied to learn about the occurrence of the suicide attempt and the number of times, the age at the moment of the single or last attempt, the motives behind it, and the methods employed to carried it out. These last two indicators were designed as an open question in order to establish the range of possible methods and motives to carry out a suicide attempt. In the 1997 study, the indicator of lethality were the values taken from the hospitalization-treatment report following the suicide attempt; and in the 2000 study, the indicator was the wish to die.
   The prevalence of the suicide attempt in Mexico City in 1997 was 8.3% (n=849), and in 2000 it increased to 9.5% (n=1,009). In 1997, the following were the political delegations with prevalences higher than the global at least in one percentual unit (greater than or equal to 9.3%: Cuauhtemoc (11.3%), Tlalpan (10.1%), Iztacalco (9.9%) and Benito Juarez (9.6%); and in 2000 (greater than or equal to 10.5%): Benito Juarez (12.3%), Venustiano Carranza (12.1%), Gustavo A. Madero (11.8%) and Cuauhtemoc (10.6%).
   This problem was more frequent in women (more than three for each man). In high school, the prevalences were higher; nevertheless, the ages of the single/last suicide attempts reported indicated that, for the majority, the event occurred during the last years of elementary school and/or during junior high school. In addition, there was a large number of suicide attempts in private schools, specially at the high school level.
   While suicide attempts in students were more frequent among women, it was observed that the profile of its characteristics was similar between men and women according to:
   age: occurrence of the single/last attempt: between 10 and 15 years old;
   recurrence: in the two studies, one out of each four women had carried out at least two suicide attempts; in men, this ratio was one out of five students with suicide attempt in 1997, but in 2000 it increased to one out of each three with suicide attempt during the life-time;
   motives: in both sexes, a clear predominance of motives of suicide attempt related to the interpersonal sphere (specifically family conflicts as a expression of familiar violence) was observed, followed by motives related to the emotional sphere (such as depressive feelings);
   methods: the most frequent method, which also showed a tendency to increase was: self-cutting with a sharp instrument (frequently, a cutter or a piece of glass);
   lethality:almost a third part of the students of both sexes reported the), carried out the single or last suicide attempt having the wish to die, and almost half of the students reported that they did not think about living or dying as a consequence of the suicide attempt.
   Regardless of the reaches and limitations of the census methodology, our results allow us to consider that suicide behavior among adolescent students in Mexico City is increasing. It therefore requires attention in the light of the many risks involved; in turn, this implies carrying out descriptive and preventive researches with a multidisciplinary perspective.

   scene investigations; suicide; Mexico
AB Crime scene investigation reports, like other kids of official bureaucratic documents, serve an important purpose in the functioning of modern states. This article examines crime scene investigation reports from a city in southeastern Mexico pseudonymously called La Ciudad. The article combines textual discourse analysis of police suicide investigation reports with ethnographic analysis of police investigative practices to ask, how do law enforcement documents showcase the interactions between law enforcement agents and citizens? In what way can ethnographic analysis highlight and supplement the strengths and limitations of law enforcement documents as prisms of social reality? The complex and contested relationship between representatives of a Mexican law enforcement agency and the citizenry it claims to protect is visible in the documents it produces. The ethnographic material further deepens the reader's understanding of the ways in which law enforcement agents and common citizens form relationships based on negotiation and distrust.

AB Suicide is a neglected area of social work research and suicides are often influenced by cultural factors. WHO data on female youth (15-24 years) suicide, and Undetermined Deaths (UnD), the most likely source of under-reported suicides, are analysed from two continents sharing religio-cultural views on suicide and family planning, that is, Western European Catholic countries (WECC) and Latin American countries (LatAC). It was found that LatAC female youth suicides and UnD were significantly higher than WECC, and correlated with higher birth rates and poverty. This may indicate that restricted access to family planning contributes to more births, poverty, unwanted pregnancies and suicides.

DT Article

AB Objective. To describe mortality from suicides in Mexico in 2001, as well as the main changes in the methods used to commit suicide and in trends by age and gender that have been observed since 1990, both for the country as a whole and for each state.
   Methods. For this descriptive study we utilized as information sources the official mortality records of the National Institute of Statistics, Geography, and Informatics (Instituto Nacional de Estadistica, Geografia e Informatica) for the period of 1990 through 2001. To calculate mortality rates we used the populations estimated in 2002 by the National Population Council (Consejo Nacional de Poblacion). Mortality was described by sex, age group, and state, along with the changes seen over the period of 1990 through 2001 in the rates and methods of suicide. We used the direct method to standardize the rates, using as a reference the population data for the year 2000. To make statistical comparisons of the trends by age group and gender we used a test of parallelism utilizing the F statistic. The level of statistical significance of differences in suicide methods was determined with the chi-square test.
   Results. During 2001, 3 784 suicides were registered (3 110 of them in men and 674 in women), which represents a rate of 3.72 deaths from suicide per 100 000 persons, in a total national population of 101.8 million inhabitants. The states with the highest suicide mortality were Campeche and Tabasco (9.68 and 8.47 per 100 000, respectively). The lowest rates were seen in Chiapas and the state of Mexico (1.03 and 1.99 per 100 000, respectively). In 2001, mortality from suicides per 100 000 persons was 6.14 in men and 1.32 in women. The greatest increase by age group was seen in women 11-19 years old (from 0.8 per 100 000 in 1990 to 2.27 per 100 000 in 2001). The largest increase in men also occurred among those 11-19 years old (from 2.6 per 100 000 in 1990 to 4.5 per 100 000 in 2001). The highest rate (13.62 per 100 000 persons) was seen in men over 65 years of age. There were changes in suicide methods, with hanging now being the method most frequently used by both men and women.
   Conclusions. Suicide is a growing problem in Mexico, and controlling it requires immediate steps. The rapid increase in this phenomenon, particularly among young men and young women, should produce a call to action to quickly implement measures aimed at reducing the magnitude of suicide.

AB Objective: How social support (SS) affects the odds of suicide attempt among American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth in New Mexico and is modified by school location and metropolitan status. Methods: Multiple logistic regression for complex design was used to produce the adjusted odds of suicide attempt by SS using the New Mexico Youth Risk and Resiliency Survey (NM-YRRS) for 2011 (n = 2,730), 2013 (n = 3,171), and 2015 (n = 2,604) while adjusting for age, grade, gender, and maternal education level. Primary outcome: one self-reported suicide attempt in the past 12 months. Primary exposure: social support, categorized as low, moderate, and high support. Additional analysis on the 2015 NM-YRRS to understand how SS and the odds of suicide attempt were modified by (a) school location and (b) metropolitan status while adjusting for age, grade, gender, maternal education level, urbanicity, reservation status, unstable housing, forced sexual intercourse, and teen dating violence (n = 1,373). Results: The adjusted odds of suicide attempt among AI/AN students with low support compared to those with high support has declined from 2011 to 2015 (AOR = 5.5, 95% CI 3.3-9.6, in 2011; AOR= 2.2, 95% CI 1.3-3.7, in 2015). Low SS is a significant risk factor for rural/on reservation students. In contrast, low SS was not a risk factor for AI/AN students who attended schools in urban counties. Conclusion: Results address a gap in current research regarding differences in urban/rural AI/AN youth. In addition to SS, this study indicates there are unknown risk factors that drive suicide attempt for AI/AN youth in off reservation/urban schools.

AB This study sought to examine the differences between males and females regarding suicide ideation as related to life events, depression and alcohol consumption. Patients aged 18-65 years old were interviewed at admission in one of three emergency rooms (ER). Results revealed a 5.7% prevalence of suicide ideation, 66.3% of them were women, and 45.3% of ideators fluctuated between 18 and 29 years of age. Suicide ideation was higher among separated/divorced patients. Differences among males and females in alcohol consumption and life events were found. It was concluded that suicide prevention programs should consider differences in prevalence, as well as similarities in risk factors for suicide ideation in males and females. Gender roles in suicide ideation are discussed.

AB Background: We report the prevalence and associations between traumatic events and suicidal ideation, suicide plans and suicide attempts among Mexican adolescents. Methods: The data are from a representative multistage probability household survey of 3,005 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years residing in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area that was carried out in 2005. We used discrete time survival analyses to model the net impact of retrospectively reported prior occurrence of traumatic events on ideation, plans and attempts, taking into account the onset of psychiatric disorders. Results: Prevalence of suicidality was high among respondents with traumatic events, ranging from a 43% prevalence of suicidal ideation among those with a history of 'Being raped' to a 25% prevalence of suicide attempts among those that reported 'Purposely injured, tortured or killed someone.' In cross-sectional estimates, any traumatic event was associated with an increase of 3.2 times the odds of suicide ideation, 5.1 times the odds of a plan and 6.6 times the odds of an attempt. Number of events was also associated with increasing suicidality such that those with three or more events were 13.7 times more likely to report a suicide attempt than those with none. Multivariate discrete time survival models that took into account a large number of demographic, suicide-related and psychiatric disorder variables reduced in strength but did not alter these basic relationships. Conclusions: We conclude that traumatic events such as rape and sexual assault have a profound impact upon suicidality and that this relationship is not entirely explained by the onset of psychiatric disorders. Comprehensive interventions for adolescent victims of traumatic events, especially those with a history of cumulative events, should include, but not be restricted to, treatment of any associated psychiatric disorder.

Differences are found between the types of cases in marital relationship, age, blood alcohol, and the use of firearms. Physicians and other health care providers who treat victims of intimate partner violence and patients at risk for suicide should be aware of the interwoven risk factors within these populations. Interventions aimed at suicide prevention as well as targeted removal of firearms should be investigated as tools in the prevention of intimate partner homicide.

AB Research has repeatedly demonstrated that religiosity can potentially serve as a protective factor against suicidal behavior. A clear understanding of the influence of religion on suicidality is required to more fully assess for the risk of suicide. The databases PsycINFO and MEDLINE were used to search peer-reviewed journals prior to 2008 focusing on religion and suicide. Articles focusing on suicidality across Buddhism, Native American and African religions, as well as on the relationship among Atheism, Agnosticism, and suicide were utilized for this review. Practice recommendations are offered for conducting accurate assessment of religiosity as it relates to suicidality in these populations. Given the influence of religious beliefs on suicide, it is important to examine each major religious group for its unique conceptualization and position on suicide to accurately identify a client's suicide risk.

AB Objective: To determine rates of lifetime suicide attempts in a community sample of Native Hawaiian adolescents and determine the contribution of Hawaiian cultural affiliation, socioeconomic status, and psychiatric symptoms as risk factors for suicide. Method: High school students were surveyed in the state of Hawaii for lifetime suicide attempts, Hawaiian cultural affiliation, socioeconomic status, and symptoms of depression, substance abuse, aggression, and anxiety. Multiple logistic regressions were used on 3,094 subjects to develop prediction models for lifetime suicide attempts. Results: Native Hawaiian adolescents had significantly higher rates of suicide attempts (12.9%) than other adolescents in Hawaii (9.6%). Hawaiian cultural affiliation rather than ethnicity was uniquely predictive of suicide attempts. Logistic regression indicated that depression, substance abuse, grade level, Hawaiian cultural affiliation, and main wage earner's education best predicted suicide attempts in Native Hawaiian adolescents, while depression, substance abuse, and aggression predicted suicide attempts in non-Hawaiians. Conclusions: Native Hawaiian adolescents have higher rates of attempted suicide than non-Hawaiian adolescents. Strong Hawaiian cultural affiliation rather than ethnicity is a risk factor for attempted suicide.

AB Although over 100 years of research has been dedicated to understanding the connection between religiosity and suicide, many questions still remain. This is especially true among adolescent populations in countries outside the US. In 2008, over 700 students attending eight alternative high school centers in central Mexico completed a health survey designed to provide a comprehensive overview of their physical, mental, spiritual, and emotional health. This article reports on the findings of a secondary analysis study of those data and focuses on the protective influence of religiosity on suicidal ideation. The findings of this study are discussed in light of the network theory's assertion that there is a belonging aspect to religion, and also to the idea that in religiously homogeneous communities of Mexico, religion can have a protective effect on the suicidal ideation of its members.

AB Introduction: Suicide is a multifactorial phenomenon that is frequently found in comorbidity with mental disorders, such as depression and substance abuse, which can interact in summation to produce any element of the continuum of suicidal behavior: ideation, planning, attempt, and death by suicide. Objectives: To describe the relationship between depression and other mental disorders with substance abuse and suicidal behavior, and to discuss its implications for mental health services in Mexico. Methods: A narrative review of the literature of articles published national and internationally was carried out to describe the relationship between depression and other mental disorders with substance abuse and suicidal behavior. Results: The review of the literature demonstrates the relationship between depression and substance abuse (mainly alcohol) with suicidal behavior; however, the need for its early diagnosis and timely treatment is indicated, especially in high-risk groups, like adolescents. Conclusions: There is a synergistic relationship between depression and substance use for the presence of greater suicidal behavior, which implies important challenges in mental health care services as early identification and effective management are essential to reduce the impact of the continuum of suicidal behavior.

AB The cross-cultural generalizability of the interpersonal theory of suicide was examined in this study. One hundred ninety-nine adults in an inpatient setting in Mexico completed the Personal Resources Questionnaire, Beck Hopelessness Scale, Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire, Acquired Capability for Suicide Scale, and Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised. Analyses revealed the interaction between perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness did not predict suicide ideation. The interactions between perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness and between perceived burdensomeness and acquired capacity significantly predicted suicidal behaviors, whereas the hypothesized three-way interaction did not. These findings highlight the importance of perceived burdensomeness in the development of suicidal behaviors among Mexican-origin adults.

AB BACKGROUNDFor schools to be safe and supportive for students, school health professionals should be aware of the particular challenges lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning (LGBTQ) students face, especially the risk for discrimination, violent victimization, and depression in the school setting. We assessed school health professionals' preparedness to address needs of LGBTQ students.
   METHODSWe conducted a secondary analysis of data collected during a New Mexico school health conference. This analysis focused on the preparedness of 183 school nurses, counselors, and social workers to address needs of LGBTQ students. Data were analyzed by using chi-square tests, other non-parametric tests, and logistic regression.
   RESULTSSocial workers (84.6%) and counselors (81.5%) were more likely than school nurses (55.8%) to report moderate or high knowledge of LGBTQ youth health risks, including suicide and depression (p<.001). Approximately half of school counselors and social workers reported no or low knowledge of LGBTQ community-based organizations or knowledge of counselors experienced with LGBTQ concerns.
   CONCLUSIONSchool health professionals in New Mexico do not appear prepared to address needs of LGBTQ students. Schools should consider integrating specific content about LGBTQ health risks and health disparities in trainings regarding bullying, violence, cultural competency, and suicide prevention.

AB Background: Prior studies have reported that psychiatric disorders are among the strongest predictors of suicidal behavior (i.e., suicide ideation, plans, and attempts). However, surprisingly little is known about the independent associations between each disorder and each suicidal behavior due to a failure to account for comorbidity.
   Methods: This study used data from a representative sample of 5782 respondents participating in the Mexican National Comorbidity Survey (2001-2002) to examine the unique associations between psychiatric disorders and suicidality.
   Results: A prior psychiatric disorder was present in 48.8% of those with a suicide ideation and in 65.2% of those with an attempt. Discrete-time survival models adjusting for comorbidity revealed that conduct disorder and alcohol abuse/dependence were the strongest predictors of a subsequent suicide attempt. Most disorders predicted suicidal ideation but few predicted the transition from ideation to a suicide plan or attempt.
   Limitations: M-NCS is a household survey that excluded homeless and institutionalized people, and the diagnostic instrument used did not include an assessment of all DSM-IV disorders which would increase the comorbidity discussed here.
   Conclusions: These results reveal a complex pattern of associations in which diverse psychiatric disorders impact different parts of the pathway to suicide attempts. These findings will help inform clinical and public health efforts aimed at suicide prevention in Mexico and other developing countries. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID RISK-FACTORS; DISORDERS; BEHAVIOR; VICTIMS; 5-HIAA; MEXICO; CHILD
AB Suicidal behavior is a complex event. Neurobiological, psychological and sociodemographic factors are involved. Suicide is a health problem which accounts for 0.9% of all worldwide deaths.
   In Mexico, the suicide mortality, rate in males was 5.9 x 100,000 inhabitants in 2000, and was the 17th cause of death among males in the same year.
   In the USA, the death rate due to suicide has remained stable for last 15 years. In contrast, in Mexico this phenomenon has increased.
   In 1970 the rate death by suicide was 1.01 per 100,000 inhabitants and in 2000 increased to 5.9. In Mexico, there are many different report sources related to suicide incidence, but unfortunately the information is incongruous. Recent research shows that some of these report sources are not reliable.
   Additionally, there is no information about sociodemographic factors such as age, gender, or place of residence linked to suicide behavior. According to Mexican laws, all death by suicide requires an autopsy to be practiced. For this reason, we consider the registration at the SEMEFO (Medical Forensic Services)of the state of Queretaro, to be optimum for this analysis.
   The objective of the present study is to know the suicide rate in population older than 10 years in the state of Queretaro, Mexico, during the last seven years and, in addition, to find out some factors related to death by suicide.
   We computed the rate of suicide in subjects older than 10 years from 1996 to 2002. Additionally, a retrospective analysis was made from the data base which included social and demographic information such as age, gender, place of residence, hour and month of death from the diseases registered at the SEMEFO in Queretaro from January 1999 to December 2001.
   A descriptive statistic was made of the suicide deaths and other different causes. A logistic regression and structural analysis model was applied to identify the social and demographic variables associated with the suicide behavior.
   The retrospective cohort was integrated for the deaths registered at SEMEFO from 1996 to 2003 in Queretaro, which contains all deaths that required a forensic intervention in the state. This included the information reported by the four SEMEFO ubicated in the state: Queretaro, Cadereyta, San Juan del Rio, and Jalpan counties.
   The death cause was determinated in the following way: once authorities were informed about the ocurrence of a death, a team conformed by a forensic medical doctor, photographer, criminalistic expert, chemist expert, and dactiloscopist expert, collected the evidences and the body was transfered to the correspondig SEMEFO in order to practice the autopsy.
   All the information was reported to the police in order to proceed with the death cause investigation. Together with the authorities, the police and the SEMEFO defined if the death was secondary to suicide, illness, homicide or accident.
   The three SEMEFO ubicated across the State reported directly to SEMEFO at Queretaro city. We used the total number of suicide deaths registered at the SEMEFO each year, and the annual projections for the number of inhabitants older than 10 years provided from CONAPO (National Council of Population) from 1996 to 2002, to estimate the mortality ratio by year and per 100,000 inhabitants.
   The social and demographic characteristics of a total of 2,396 deaths which occurred due to different causes were analyzed. The rate of suicide in subjects older than 10 years was 2.49 in 1996, 4.74 in 1997, 4.05 in 1998, 4.39 in 1999, 4.39 in 2000, 6.04 in 2001, and 3.43 in 2002. All rate's are per 100,000 inhabitants.
   The rate of suicide per year and per age group was the highest for those subjects in the 20-29 years old age group and those older than 50 years. The risk of suicide showed an inverse relationship to the age.
   The relative risk to commit suicide by each year of age was 1.033 (CI 96% 1.022-1.043) (X(2)w [1] = 38.59; p < 0.001). Living in a place with more than 179,000 inhabitants increased the risk 1.46 times (CI 95% 1.0504-2.0418)(X(2)w [1] = 5.06; p = 0.024). When the age effect was controlled, the risk of dying by suicide in those who lived in a place with more than 179,000 increased to 1.52 (CI 95% 1.0859-2.1240) (X(2)w [1] 5.96; p = 0.01).
   In the structural analysis, the age and place of residence were the factors directly related to suicide behavior.
   The main method used to commit suicide were hanging (107 cases), shooting with fire arm (37 cases), and overdose medication (15 cases).
   Conclusion: Suicidal behavior has increased in the last seven years in Queretaro. Males in an age range between 20 and 29 ears and those older than 50 years old, showed the highest risk of dying by suicide.

AB This report describes ethnic and gender differences in suicide ideation among two large samples of middle school students in New Mexico (n = 2,140) and Texas (n = 1,302). Students completed a self-administered questionnaire on suicide ideation and psychosocial risk factors. Mexican Americans in both samples reported significantly higher prevalence of suicide ideation than did their European American counterparts. Mexican Americans were 1.8 times more likely to have high suicide ideation than European Americans. The suicide ideation risk for Mexican Americans remained unchanged in both samples after adjusting for gender, age, family structure, depression, low social support, and self-esteem. This study indicates that ethnicity plays an important role in suicidal ideation, but the mechanism remains unclear.

ID PATTERNS
AB The automatic analysis of suicide data(texts) has become a challenge for the computational linguistics research field, increasingly, tools are needed to help reduce suicide rates, for example, by extracting the suicide causes in order to support their early detection. Linguistic aspects in Spanish texts, such as cue phrases or parts of speech, can help in this task. Therefore, this paper presents a computational approach to the extraction and analysis of suicide causes from news reports in Spanish. The automatic extraction of suicide causes is carried out through linguistic markers based on verbs, connectors, prepositions and conjunctions. On the other hand, the analysis of the suicides causes is performed in two approaches: a) an analysis focused on verbal and noun phrases, studying the presence of the negation; b) an analysis on the frequency about unigrams or bigrams of words. Both analyzes show promising and correlated results, which are useful for recognizing the suicide causes reported in Mexico in a given period. Finally, a corpus is obtained with a collection of 581 suicide causes.

AB Background: Evidence suggests that liability for suicide behavior is heritable; additionally, suicide has been partly related to other psychiatric disorders. Nevertheless, most of the information reported so far address Caucasian and Asian individuals. Hence, our aim was to conduct a gene-level association study in Mexican psychiatric individuals diagnosed with suicide attempt. Methods We recruited 192 individuals from two clinical centers in Mexico. All participants were born in Mexico and had Mexican parents and grandparents. Direct genotyping was performed using the commercial platform Infinium PsychArray BeadChip. A p-value lower than 1e-05 was considered as gene-level significant and a p-value lower than 1e-04 was considered as gene-level nominal significant. Results Our analyses showed that SCARA5 was associated to suicide intent at a gene-level with statistical significance (p-value = 1.12e-6). Other genes were nominally associated with suicide attempt: GHSR (p-value = 0.0004), RGS10 (p-value = 5.13e-5), and STK33 (p-value = 3.62e-5). Regarding gene variant analyses, the SNPs with a statistical association (p > .05) were rs561361616, rs1537577, rs11198999 for RGS10, and rs11041981, rs11041993, rs11041994, rs11041995, rs11041997, rs10840083, rs10769918 for STK33. For these genes, previous studies have associated SCARA5 with depression, GHSR with alcohol dependence and depression, and RGS10 with schizophrenia and depression. To date, STK33 has not been associated with any psychiatric disorder. Conclusion Our outcomes revealed that SCARA5, GHSR, RGS10 and STK33 could be considered as risk biomarkers for suicide attempt behavior in our Mexican psychiatric sample. We recommend to perform larger scale analyses to have conclusive results.

AB Background: Nationally representative data from Mexico are presented on the lifetime and 12-month prevalence of the onset of suicide ideation, suicide plans and suicide attempt, as well as associated DSM-IV psychiatric disorders and service utilization.
   Methods: Data are from the Mexican National Comorbidity Survey (M-NCS). This population survey was carried out in 2001-2003 in a sample of 5,782 respondents of 18 years and older. Onset of ideation, a plan, and suicide attempt, as well as psychiatric and service use correlates were estimated using survival analysis.
   Results: Of the respondents, 8.3% reported lifetime ideation, 3.2% reported a lifetime plan and 2.8% reported lifetime suicide attempt(s). The prevalence for 12-month suicidal behaviors was 2.3%, 1.0% and 0.6%, respectively. Suicidal behaviors were more prevalent in early adolescence and early adulthood and became less common after the mid-thirties, with the exception of suicidal ideation that continues into older ages. Having met criteria for one or more of the DSM-IV disorders assessed in the survey was common among suicide ideators (60.9%), planners (75.6%) and attempters (74.6%), and was a strong risk factor for suicidal behaviors, with odds ratios of 4.8 for ideation, 10.2 for plan and 9.6 for attempt. Approximately one of even, four Lifetime attempters reported to have ever seen a psychiatrist.
   Conclusions: As in many other countries, mental disorders have an important impact on suicidal behaviors in Mexico. Intervention efforts aimed at identifying and treating persons at or before the onset of suicidal ideation is strongly recommended.

AB Suicide is an important public health problem that requires a preventive approach. The present study aimed at assessing suicidal behaviors and their relations with other psychosocial factors in Campeche, Mexico, in order to inform the design of potential preventive interventions. A multistage probability sample of 2386 students representative of all middle schools of the state of Campeche, Mexico, took a standardized, paper-and-pencil survey covering selected psychosocial constructs including suicide behavior, depression, drug use, familial relationships, locus of control, impulsivity, and self-esteem, among others. Latent classes were identified and multinomial logistic regression was used to analyze associations between class membership and psychosocial covariates. An estimated 8% of the middle school population in Campeche had three or more psychosocial problems in the past month including drug use, major depression episode symptoms, as well as suicidal problems like attempts and self-inflicted injuries. Four latent classes were identified, one with lowest risk and three with varying characteristics in terms of binge alcohol and other drug use, depression, and suicide behaviors. Associations between psychosocial covariates and latent class were observed, as predicted based on a multidimensional theoretical framework. Heterogeneity across "High-Risk" groups and their potential determinants highlight the need for differentiated, specialized efforts ranging from universal to indicated interventions. Given the high level of risk factors in this population, universal preventive interventions should aim at building resiliency among youth by helping them develop an array of coping resources, as well as by creating a more nurturing psychosocial environment.

AB Objectives. We evaluated the efficacy of 15 years of a public health-oriented suicidal-behavior prevention program among youths living on an American Indian reservation.
   Methods. All suicides, suicide attempts, and suicidal gestures were monitored. Age-specific analyses over time were used to assess outcomes.
   Results. Both descriptive and linear regression analyses indicated that a substantial drop occurred in suicidal gestures and attempts. Suicide deaths neither declined significantly nor increased, although the total number of self-destructive acts declined by 73% (P=.001).
   Conclusions. Data from this community-based approach document a remarkable downward trend-measured-by both magnitude and temporal trends in the specifically targeted age cohorts-in suicidal acts. The sequential decrease in age-specific rates of suicide attempts and gestures is indicative of the program's success.

   BEHAVIOR
AB Suicide occurrence is ever more often amongst 15-24-year-old youngsters, and it ranks as the second or third cause of death in some countries. Likewise, suicide attempts are more frequent amongst teenagers than amongst any other age-group.
   Several studies agree that the portion of population with the highest suicide risk is that ranging from ages 15 to 24 and that Mexico is one of the countries wherein this trend, and suicide in general, is more rapidly increasing. On the other hand, almost 5% of all the country's suicides take place in the State of Guanajuato.
   The process of suicide is a complex and dynamic one that goes through a series of stages before culminating in the life-ending act. These phases, from rnerely picturing the idea to brandishing it as a verbal threat, planning and executing it, may very well be identified I in advance, hence allowing for adequate intervention. Therefore, understanding suicide dynamics and, identifying risk factors reduce the likelihood of suicide in specific populations: this is the core of suicide prevention. Such prevention programs take place within the every day environment of the people to whom they are targeted and their efficiency increase as the acknowledgement of both their needs and resources is more precise. It is because of this, and as a response to the lack of information pertaining suicide prevention programs in Mexico, that this report is presented. It stems from a preventive experience amongst high school youths in the State of Guanajuato.
   The aim of the aforementioned preventive workshop was to awaken risk prevention amongst high school students through a psycho-educative strategy. The workshop, called << Saving Lives >>, inspired in the << Gatekeeper >> model and based on previous studies of that same population, consisted of ten hours spliced in five two-hour sessions throughout which scientific information on suicide was presented, suicide-related myths,analyzed, attendants were trained for detecting people at stake, and intervention, channeling and self- care suggestions were made. Suicide awareness was assessed both prior and upon workshop ending; furthermore, the workshop itself was evaluated through a questionnaire. Trained psychology students cursing the tenth semester were appointed coordinators and high school students of both sexes attended the workshop. The invitation was open to the general public and those who completed all five stages were certified << Informed Guardians >>. The workshop was carried out in eight of the ten high schools administered by the Universidad de Guanajuato in the state. Sixty-nine students attended-and completed all five set sessions. The average age of attendants was 16.1 years old; standard deviation Was 1.3 years; 69% of them were female.
   Out of 22 possible points included in the suicide knowledge evaluation questionnaire, the average result on first answering was 12.59 correct answers, which rose to 15.97 upon completing the, workshop. The range of grades was increased one point for both the minimum and the maximum values and standard deviation was reduced from 2.62 to 2.49. The increase in suicide knowledge was then proved through a << T >> test for two dependent samples since it showed the significance of the result increase (p < 0.001).
   The benefits of the workshop were tested through attendants' comments and coordinators reports analyses. Tearing down of suicide myths such as the confusion between the embracing of suicide ideas, and their actual fulfillment, the consideration of suicide as a sign of, either bravery or mental illness, the notion that talking,about suicide with,someone who has expressed his wish for committing suicide is tactless or that a suicidal does not show any warning signals were outstanding elements. The workshop evaluation questionnaire, objective fulfillment, workshop methodology, time management and topic selection were all praised by the attendants.
   The third workshop evaluation instrument involved the coordinators reports, thus corroborating the workshop reach and gaining further information: six of the attendants knew someone who had tried suicide; seven more had embraced suicidal ideas, of whom five actually tried them out actively.
   << Saving Lives >> left amongst its conclusions the fact that 12 out of 69 attendants acknowledged having either embraced or tried suicide previously. This could have proved motivation enough so as to become << informed Guardians >> and pin-points the importance or teenage prevention, for not only are they the group with the,highest risk but also because they are the first to know of changes and/or suicide risk within their circle of friends. Besides, when trained as suicide prevention agents, they may spread the word and adequate information not only in school-based environment's,but wherever the happen to interact, be it at home or recreational centers, amongst many others.
   Another benefit that stems from the workshop is an even more accurate definition of suicide concepts. Several suicide myths were clarified. The fact that the workshop coordinators were students was regarded as positive by both attendants and the coordinators themselves.
   In spite of the appalling increase in mortality figures due to suicide, there are virtually no suicide prevention programs in Mexico, and the scarce ones are utterly limited. The proposed workshop proved a means of effective objective reach since not only does it provide information pertaining specific suicide facts but also focuses on the needs and helping possibilities embodied by the << informed Guardians >>. Moreover, thanks to having been designed based on previous studies of the some population, it is so flexible a project that it can be adopted for further use in elementary schools.
   Such an extensive and urgent task as suicide prevention should summon the combined effort of all social spheres. The established misconception that suicide care is a responsibility constrained to certain institutions, limits the individual responsibility so much as the society's, as well as prevention itself. An effective dispel of such conception amongst young attendants was another achievement of the workshop. The challenge now is to reach cooperation agreements with all social participants who have a word in it so as to stop and revert the current increasing trend in suicide.

The cases were 235 teenagers who presented both suicidal ideation and suicide attempt; the controls were 470 individuals of the same age and sex. Results. Sexual abuse showed the highest degree of association with suicidal behavior (OR=27.4), followed by verbal violence (OR=9.28), drug use (OR=8.6), physical violence (OR=5.5) and smoking (OR=3.6). Multivariate logistic regression showed that verbal violence was associated with suicidal behavior independently of the other variables, while physical violence, sexual abuse, smoking and drug use seem to depend on verbal violence. Conclusions. Domestic violence, particularly verbal or sexual, is strongly associated with suicidal behavior in adolescents and should be considered in suicide prevention programs.

AB Studies in temperate countries show a direct correlation between the hours of daily light and the frequency of suicides. This relationship is damped in countries at the equatorial level, and what happens near the tropic lines is unknown. In this paper the suicide rates as well as the monthly average of daily light were analyzed in hours from 1990 to 2016 in Campeche, Mexico, a place with a high rate of suicide deaths and near the latitude of the Tropic of Cancer. The results showed that total suicides and sunshine were positively correlated (r = 0.649; p = 0.022) and the peak of maximum light in June coincides with the maximum suicide peak. There were non-significant peaks of higher suicides in June and December for men and in May for women. However, a clear, significant peak (p = 0.003) showed up in spring. We recommend strengthening the prevention programs during these periods.

AB The aim of the present study was to identify leisure time and its association to suicide attempts in a sample of 1290 Mexican adolescents aged 12-18 (36 % male, 64 % female). The instrument included both, closed and open items. Out of 11 leisure categories, relationships outside their families were the most prevalent at 96 % while school-related activities were the least prevalent (at 1.8 %). Statistically significant differences were found for suicidal behavior and passive activities, home activities, family relationships, and body selfcare. Recreation activities such as sports and arts, and relationships outside their families were found to be protective factors. Concluding considerations about the creative use of leisure for contemporary adolescents and families are included.

AB Recent studies have showed that suicide behavior is present in students of junior and senior high school. In Mexico City, a prevalence of 4.3% in men and 12.1% in women has been reported. The motivations for suicide attempt are multiple, and sexual abuse has been recognized as one of them. This problem has been scarcely documented in students in our country. Nevertheless, a prevalence of 4.3% has been found in junior and senior high school students of both sexes. The present paper explores the association between suicide attempt and sexual abuse, and the impact that these problems can cause in the current mental health of the Students, particularly in terms of depression and suicide ideation.
   The objective is to identify in a population of two junior high schools in the downtown area of 'Mexico City: 1) the frequency of sexual abuse and suicide attempt experienced once in a lifetime; 2) the frequency of current depression and suicide ideation; 3} the association between sexual abuse and suicide attempt with current depression and Suicide ideation; and 4) the frequency of current depression and suicide ideation in students that reported sexual abuse or suicide attempt.
   A total of 936 students participated: 54% men and 46% women, with a mean age of 13.7 years. A survey was performed with the permission of the Ministry of Education and the school authorities. The instrument was self-administered. The participation was voluntary, and confidentiality and anonymity were assured.
   The results show that 7% of the women and 2% of the men had experienced sexual abuse, and that 11,0 of the women and 4% of the men had attempted to commit suicide. Among the male population, there were no cases of sexual abuse nor suicide attempt; but among the female population, from 49 girls that had attempted to commit suicide, 12% had also been victims of sexual abuse. Most of the cases reported that sexual abuse was experienced when they were around 10 years old and the suicide attempt yeas committed when they were around 12 years old. The frequency of current depression and suicide attempt were 14% and 15%, respectively in men and in women, 18% in both indicators. The association between sexual abuse and suicide attempt, and the indicators of current emotional problems was statistically significant. In men with suicide attempt, 50% showed current depression and suicide ideation; in women with sexual abuse and suicide attempt, the frequency was 67%. These results are discussed with the aim of malting evident the need to establish preventive strategies for the early detection and the promotion of emotional health among the school population.

TI Epidemiology of suicide in the state of Guanajuato.
SO SALUD MENTAL

DT Article

ID MEXICO
AB From the epidemic perspective, suicide appears as an international public health problem due to the remarkable increase of its incidence. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in the year 2000, suicide had the greater percentage (49%) in the statistics of "deaths by intentional injuries"; followed by violence (32%) and war (19%).
   This source also notifies that in countries with population over 100 millions, Mexico is the country that shows the higher increase of "changes in age-standardized groups in specific intervals of time" (+61, 9% in period 81-83/93-95). Followed in descendent order by: India (+54%, period 80-93), Brazil (+13.2%, period 79-81/93-93), and the Russian Federation (+5.3%, period 80-82/96-98). The United States of America (-5.3%, period 80-82/93-97) and Japan (-14.3%, period 80-82/95-97) have shown decreasing rates.
   The increase in the rates of suicide in Mexico has been registered by various studies, which also have proved that the States where those rates were the highest are: Veracruz, Mexico City and, in third place, Guanajuato.
   Some specific sectors of Guanajuato State show an association of two phenomena: suicide and migration, basically migrants travelling to the United States of America and Canada, both countries with a high frequency of suicides. The information on suicide in Mexico come from sources such as local or international studies, and also from reports obtained through public institutions, the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica, Geografia e Informatica (INEGI), the Secreteria de Salud (SS) and the Procuraduria General de Justicia (PGJ). Nevertheless, the data given by these institutions show discrepancies in statistics, a fact due perhaps to differences in the classification criteria for deaths, and to registration and filing mistakes.
   The aim of the present research was to collect and report epidemiological data on suicides and the characteristics of the suicidal events, in the State of Guanajuato, during the period between 1995 and 2001. To this purpose the files of the PGJ in Guanajuato State were analyzed; these files contain detailed information about suicides and the suicidal act, as well as the transcription of suicidal notes, in case they be left. They also contain declarations and testimonies from people who are close (relatives, friends, acquaintances) to the suicidal victim.
   The data gathered included socio-demographical information, migrant condition, variables related to the Suicidal act, alcohol and drug use at the moment of the event, and the transcription of the suicidal note. The declarations and testimonies from the suicide acquaintances were kept for further studies.
   The data-gathering lasted six months and was made by last semester students of the Faculty of Psychology.
   Data were analyzed according to the State distribution Of the PGJ that divides it into 4 zones: Leon, Irapuato, Celaya and San Miguel de Allende. Frequency analysis were made and for some variables, chi square statistical tests.
   Of the 747 cases of death caused by suicide registered by the PGJ in Guanajuato, during the 1995 - 2001 period, 733 were analyzed because the lacking 13 files Could not be located. From the total of cases 80.1% were men and 19.9%, women. The rank of age goes from 8 to 9 1 years. The average for men was 30 years and the mode 20 years; for women the average was 28 wars and the mode 18 years old. This shows that Suicide was committed at,an earlier age by women than by men.
   Only 10% of the whole had no schooling; almost half of the total had completed elementary Studies and 21% had attained high school level. Besides, 30% of the people who committed suicide were employees and only 1.6% were professionals.
   Regarding the characteristics of the suicidal act, the place more used to committ it, was the suicide's house (78%), mainly in the case of women (with significant difference) (p=.001). The suicide method used in most cases was different for both sexes: men preferred hanging (p=.001), and women poisoning (p=.001).
   Forty one per cent of the men had ingested alcohol before committing suicide and only 7.8% of the women. In addition, alcohol use was more frequent in the group of 35 to 44 years of age, and by those who were married. The use of other drugs was present in 13% of the total (no significant differences between sexes).
   As to the migration phenomenon, most of migrant suicides were between 20 and 34 years old. The rate of non-migrant suicides was 4:1 (4 men committed suicide for every suicidal women) and it changed in the migrant group to 3:2. This migration phenomenon is data included: returning migrants, people who were going to leave Mexico in the near future (one day or week later) and also people who had one or more close relatives living as migrant laborers in the northern countries.
   Finally, other differences found when comparing the migrant group with the non-migrants Suicidal group are: the greater use of firearms registered as suicidal method (p=.001) and the higher percentage of psychiatric medication.
   On the other hand, the higher frequency Of Suicides was registered in the month of May (13%), and the lower percentage in October (5.7%).
   State regionalization, showed the higher percentage of suicides in Celaya (254 cases), and the lower corresponded to San Miguel de Allende (103 cases).
   It may be concluded that in the State Of Guanajuato the phenomenon of suicide presents alarming peculiarities: more risked groups include children, adolescents and Young people (this sample found 42 suicidal children under 14 years old).
   Also, considering that migration is the most important social phenomenon in Guanajuato State, we may observe that it has contributed to modify the patterns Of Suicide of some population groups. This is shown by the increasing suicidal women percentage and the most frequent use of firearms, drug and alcohol usage, and psychiatric medication; a possible explanation to this has to do with the Cultural shock of the migration process.
   Although it is difficult to consider the suicidal phenomenon as a consequence of drug abuse and vice versa, from the current frequency of suicide cases involved with drugs, at least at the moment of death, we may observe that this circumstance increases the complexity and difficulty, of the suicide problem.
   Finally, we may stress that obtaining information through the files of the PGJ demonstrated to be fruitful, because they have important elements to consider in the suicide research. Data as the transcription Of suicide notes, the declaration of relatives or close friends of the suicide, and the detailed description of the suicidal event, aren't registered by Other instances. Nevertheless, it is urgent to combine the efforts of the institutions related to the study of the suicidal behaviors, in order to systematize and to unify, the official statistics. This will optimize the registration forms and add some variables aimed to favor research purposes.

AB The objective of this study was to analyze mortality due to the main external causes of death (traffic accidents, other accidents, homicides and suicides) in Mexico, calculating the years of life lost between 0 and 100 years of age and their contribution to the change in life expectancy between 2000 and 2013, at the national level, by sex and age group. Data came from mortality vital statistics of the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia (INEGI) [National Institute of Statistics and Geography]. The biggest impact in mortality due to external causes occurred in adolescent and adult males 15-49 years of age; mortality due to these causes remained constant in males and slightly decreased in females. Mortality due to traffic accidents and other accidents decreased, with a positive contribution to life expectancy, but this effect was canceled out by the increase in mortality due to homicides and suicides. Mortality due to external causes can be avoided through interventions, programs and prevention strategies as well as timely treatment. It is necessary to develop multidisciplinary studies on the dynamics of the factors associated with mortality due to these causes.

AB Identifying whether suicides in a region are due to characteristics of the residents living there or to some enduring feature of the region is difficult when using cross-sectional studies. To distinguish these factors, we compared the suicides of a region's residents with people who were temporarily visiting the region. Using U.S. death records from 1973-2004, we focused on states with the highest and lowest suicide rates over this period. The high suicide region consisted of Arizona, Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, and Wyoming; the low suicide region consisted of Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York. For each region, we considered three groups of decedents: residents who died inside the region, residents who died outside the region, and visitors to the region. Proportionate mortality ratios were calculated for all suicides and separately for firearm suicides. In the high suicide region, visitors to and residents away from the region both had elevated suicide levels, to about the same extent as residents dying inside the region. Therefore, short-term exposure to the region and being a resident of the region each predicted suicide. In the low suicide region, the suicides of residents at home were reduced, but their suicides rose dramatically once they left the area. There was no decrease in suicides among visitors to the region. Firearm use was related to the suicide levels of each region. Overall, the results suggest that both the available means to commit suicide and the contextual features of the regions contributed to their extreme suicides. We discuss how an examination of visitors can help researchers generate novel inferences about the causes of suicide.

AB Introduction
   Suicidal behaviour is a public health problem. It has been suggested that impulsive or premeditated personality interferes with aggressive acts such as suicide.
   Objective
   In this study, we identified the socio-demographic differences when attempting suicide, as well as the concomitant depression among individuals characterized by impulsive or premeditated aggression.
   Methods
   We performed a transversal study that included 200 residents of Villahermosa, Tabasco, Mexico, who regularly use the city's General Health Services. The premeditated or impulsive aggression was evaluated using the Impulsive/Premeditated Aggression scale (IPAS). The sample was divided in two groups: impulsive and premeditator individuals. Suicidal attempt, presence of depression and socio-demographic characteristics were evaluated after wards and compared between groups.
   Results
   The psychological evaluation revealed that impulsive aggression is present in 62.71% of the population. We observed that being unemployed and/or being a woman were characteristics associated with premeditated aggression. The premeditators group had the higher proportion of concomitant depression (chi(2) = 18.29, gl = 1, p = 0.001). The proportion of people that had attempted suicide at least once during their lives was similar in both groups (impulsive = 6.06%, premeditators = 6.30%).
   Discussion and conclusion
   This study does not show any association between the personality (impulsive or premeditative) and the frequency of suicide attempts in the Tabascan General Health Services users. Nevertheless, the frame of mind (depression) could be associated with taking decisions when attempting suicide.

AB Background: Students' mental health is associated to academic performance. In high income countries, higher students' grades are related to lower odds of suicidal behaviors, but studies on other indicators of academic performance are more limited, specially in middle income countries.
   Methods: Data from 28,519 middle and high school students selected with multistage clustered sampling in the Mexican National Survey of Student's Drug Use. Using a self-administered questionnaire, lifetime suicidal attempt and four indicators of academic performance were assessed: age inconsistency with grade level, not being a student in the last year, perceived academic performance and number of failed courses. Multiple logistic regression models were used to control for sociodemographic and school characteristics.
   Results: The lifetime prevalence of attempted suicide was 3.0% for middle school students and 4.2% for high school students. Among middle school students, statistically adjusted significant associations of suicide attempt with academic performance indicators were: not being a student the year before, worse self-perceived performance and a higher number of failed courses; among high school students, predictors were failed courses and self-perceived academic performance, with ORs of 1.65 and 1.96 for the categories of good and fair/poor respectively, compared to those who reported very good performance.
   Conclusion: Self-perceived academic performance was the main indicator for suicide in both school levels. Suicide prevention efforts in Mexico's schools should include asking students about the perception they have about their own academic performance.

AB Introduction
   Suicide is a complex and multifactorial phenomenon with growing importance to public health. An increase in its occurrence has been observed in Mexico over the past 10 years. The present article analyzes the secular trend in suicide at the national level between the years 2000 and 2013.
   Materials and Methods
   All suicides during the study period (n = 64,298, of which 82.11% were men) were characterized using a spectral decomposition of the time series and a wavelet analysis to evaluate the effect of seasonal changes, type of area (urban versus rural) and sex.
   Results
   A seasonal pattern was observed with statistically significant cycles every 12 months, where peaks were identified in May but only for men in urban zones as of the year 2007. In addition, specific days of the year were found to have a higher frequency of suicides, which coincided with holidays (New Year, Mother's Day, Mexican Independence Day and Christmas).
   Conclusion
   A wavelet analysis can be used to decompose complex time series. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of this technique to the study of suicides in developing countries. This analysis enabled identifying a seasonal pattern among urban men in Mexico. The identification of seasonal patterns can help to create primary prevention strategies, increase the dissemination of crisis intervention strategies and promote mental health. These strategies could be emphasized during specific periods of the year and directed towards profiles with a higher risk.

AB Exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O-3) >= US EPA standards are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. The projection of 13.8 million AD cases in the US by the year 2050 obligate us to explore early environmental exposures as contributors to AD risk and pathogenesis. Metropolitan Mexico City children and young adults have lifetime exposures to PM2.5 and O-3, and AD starting in the brainstem and olfactory bulb is relentlessly progressing in the first two decades of life. Magnetite combustion and friction-derived nanoparticles reach the brain and are associated with early and progressive damage to the neurovascular unit and to brain cells. In this review: 1) we highlight the interplay environment/genetics in the AD development in young populations; 2) comment upon ApoE epsilon 4 and the rapid progression of neurofibrillary tangle stages and higher suicide risk in youth; and 3) discuss the role of combustion-derived nanoparticles and brain damage. A key aspect of this review is to show the reader that air pollution is complex and that profiles change from city to city with common denominators across countries. We explore and compare particulate matter profiles in Mexico City, Paris, and Santiago in Chile and make the point of why we should invest in decreasing PM2.5 to at least our current US EPA standard. Multidisciplinary intervention strategies are critical for prevention or amelioration of cognitive deficits and AD progression and risk of suicide in young individuals. AD pathology evolving from childhood is threating the wellbeing of future generations.

AB Objectives: To analyze time trends of suicide rates in Brazil overall and in Brazilian states and compare the estimated suicide rates projected for 2020 with the World Health Organization (WHO) Mental Health Action Plan target.
   Methods: This was an ecological time-series study from 1997 to 2015, stratified by Brazilian states, specific age groups, and sex. Data were obtained from the Mortality Information System (Sistema de Informacties sobre Mortalidade [SIM]) of the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Polynomial regression models were used to analyze the trends in suicide rates and to project suicide rates for 2020.
   Results: Considering 224 units of analysis, 21 (9.4%) showed a decreasing trend, 108 (48.2%) were stable, and 95 (42.4%) showed an increasing trend. Thus, 67% of units of analysis will not meet the WHO target in 2020. Mean suicide rates were higher in males than in females. People aged 60 years and older presented the highest suicide rates, while 84.7% of total deaths by suicide occurred among 15-to-59-year-olds.
   Conclusion: Overall, 90.6% of units of analysis had a stable or increasing trend in suicide rates from 1997 to 2015. If these trends remain, most of Brazil will fail to achieve the WHO-recommended reduction in suicide rates by 2020.

AB We analyze and discuss the temporal and geographic trends in the officially registered violence-related deaths (216,462 homicides and 77,334 suicides) that occurred between 1998 and 2012 on Mexican territory. Mixed-effects logistic regression models were fitted, separately for men and women and different age groups, where (a) the evolution of the log-odds of the homicide and suicide rates over time was assumed to follow a piecewise linear function and (b) the geographic variation in the latter function was accounted for by random effects associated with the 2,456 municipalities in the country. The homicide analyses show that, although the absolute homicide rates strongly differ between men and women (with a factor of about 10), the overall temporal trends for women between 16 and 49 years and men between 16 and 60 years of age are remarkably similar, in that the rates decrease until 2007 and strongly increase afterwards. In absolute terms, men between 20 and 49 years form the most vulnerable group with an averaged homicide rate in 2012 of over 40 per 100,000. Geographically, homicide rates in 2012 are found to be the highest in the states known for the drugs-related violence, which are also the states where the increase between 2007 and 2010 was the strongest. As to the suicide rates, a steady increase was found over the 15-year study period in females between 12 and 39 years and in men between 12 and 49 years of age, while in the other age groups, the rates remained relatively constant On average, a completed suicide is about eight times more likely in adult men than in adult women (although important interactions with age should be considered); men between 20 and 49 years of age, together with those over 75, are most vulnerable, with an average suicide rate of over 10 per 100,000 in 2012. In order to decrease the levels of violence in Mexico, moving beyond the political rhetoric and the implementation of evidence-based prevention programs are imperative. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Purpose This study aims to describe and characterize the spatial and temporal clustering patterns of suicide in the ten states with the greatest suicide burden in the United States from 1999 to 2016. Methods All suicide deaths from January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2016 in the United States were identified using data from the Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) dataset. The ten states with the highest age-adjusted suicide rates were Montana, Alaska, Wyoming, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, Arizona, and Oklahoma. A spatiotemporal scan statistic using a discrete Poisson model was employed to retrospectively detect spatiotemporal suicide clusters. Results From 1999 to 2016, a total of 649,843 suicides were recorded in the United States. Nineteen statistically significant spatiotemporal suicide mortality clusters were identified in the states with the greatest suicide rates, and 13.53% of the suicide cases within these states clustered spatiotemporally. The risk ratio of the clusters ranged from 1.45 to 3.64 (p < 0.001). All states had at least one cluster, with three clusters spanning multiple states, and four clusters were found in Arizona. While there was no clear secular trend in the average size of suicide clusters, the number of clusters increased from 1999 to 2016. Conclusions Hot spots for suicidal behavior in the United States warrant public health intervention and continued surveillance. As suicide rates in the US continue to increase annually, public health efforts could be maximized by focusing on regions with substantial clustering.

AB Data on the prevalence of and risk factors for suicide ideation among older people in developing countries is lacking.
   ObjectiveThis study aimed to estimate if dementia and other mental disorders are associated with suicide ideation among the older people controlling for demographic and other suspected risk factors.
   MethodsWe report on the Mexican study of dementia, part of the 10/66 international dementia research group, a series of cross-sectional population-based surveys in low and middle income countries. A survey was conducted to all residents aged 65years and older from urban and rural catchment areas in Mexico City and Morelos (January 2006 to June 2007).
   ResultsAfter 18months of field work, a total of 2003 completed interviews were obtained, with a response rate of 85.1%. We found a lifetime prevalence of suicide ideation of 13.5% and a 2-week prevalence of 4.2%. The common factors associated with both lifetime and 2-week prevalence were having a large number of physical disorders (lifetime prevalence ratio=PR and 95% confidence interval=CI; PR=2.23, CI=1.63-3.06), depression (PR=1.92, CI=1.36-2.70) and anxiety (PR=2.23, CI=1.68-2.97) and screening positive for psychosis (PR=1.64, CI=1.15-2.34).
   ConclusionDementia plays a minor role on suicide ideation after the other aforementioned variables were taken into account and its effect, if any, could be concentrated among those elders with lower severity scores of dementia. These results show the great challenges that Mexico faces in providing services for the older people with suicidality. As the population in the country ages, suicidality will constitute an additional challenge to the healthcare system. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Suicide is a multi-factorial problem with a fairly well-defined course, with different forms and categories of analysis and in some cases, objectives other than the mere loss of life. The goal is sometimes to attract attention, end suffering or take revenge on an authority figure.
   In Mexico, suicide is a public health problem since, according to the Health Secretariat reports, mortality rates due to this cause have increased in recent years.
   The importance of the problem as a trigger factor in early deaths requires research that will shed light on the elements that give rise to it, in order to design intervention and prevention strategies that will help to reduce its consequences.
   The aim of this study is to provide a review of articles focusing on the problem of suicide published by researchers at the Head Offices of Epidemiological and Psychosocial Research (in Spanish: DIEP) over the past twenty-five years. This will provide an overview of the themes, areas and units of analysis that have received most attention during this period at the Ramon de la Fuente National Institute of Psychiatry (INPRF). The discussion focuses on what has been developed to date as well as on aspects of the phenomenon that have yet to be studied.
   The study involved compiling and providing a descriptive analysis of articles published by DIEP researchers. The search for material was undertaken on the basis of bibliographic references from the Center for Information on Mental Health and Addictions (CISMAD). AN the documents in which suicide, suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts were considered variables of interest were located. Once these had been obtained, they were reviewed on the basis of various aspects which, it was felt, could provide a brief perspective of the study in each case (year, authors, title, place where data were obtained, subject matter, population, focus, and variables and instruments used). A chart was drawn up with the groups of authors trained at different times, the aspect of suicide with which they were most concerned, the type of population they focused on, the main emphasis of their writings and the number of publications.
   Results show that between 1982 and 2003, DIEP researchers published 56 articles in which the issue of suicide had been included, either as the main variable of interest or as a secondary variable. Sixty-six per cent of the latter were undertaken using data from different types of population in Mexico City; 23% drew on information from representative samples or national sources, while 11% were based on subjects or sources from elsewhere.
   As for the subject or area of interest regarding suicide in each article, 30% of the studies concentrated on suicidal thoughts; 23% on suicide attempts; 16% on suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts; 13% on suicides actually committed and suicide attempts; 9% on suicides actually committed; 5% on suicides committed, suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts, while 4% focused on suicidal behavior in general at the epidemiological level.
   As for the units of analysis used in each case, 34% focused on teenagers, 29% on adults, 21% on documentary records, 11% on teenagers and adults, and 5% on children. All the articles reviewed utilized a psychosocial or an epidemiological approach or both.
   Five fairly well-defined groups were identified of researchers that have dealt with the problem of suicide from different perspectives and for different reasons. In most cases, attention focused on the problem of suicide, and in certain other cases, suicide-related issues were analyzed collaterally, since the article focused mainly on other phenomena.
   The first group was trained in the 1980s. Its main interest lay in suicides actually committed and in suicide attempts, which were analyzed in hospital settings with adult populations.
   The second group, which worked between 1991 and 1994, focused on the relationship between suicide attempts and alcohol consumption in adults admitted to hospital emergency rooms.
   The third group had two phases of work, the first was between 1994 and 1995, and the second in 1998. It focused mainly on junior high and high school students using surveys on substance abuse, in addition to surveys on psychiatric disorders on adults among the general population, in which suicidal thoughts were included tangentially.
   The fourth group, which undertook research between 1995 and 2001, was interested in suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts in teenagers and adults in the general population and emergency rooms.
   The last group has worked since 1994. Its main field of interest has been the problem of suicide (whether actual attempts or merely thoughts) among teenage junior and senior high school students.
   Suicide is by no means an easy Subject. Articles dealing with it must be aware of the importance of accurately identifying the circumstances and aspects related to the phenomenon. For DIEP researchers, this has proved to be an extremely fruitful line of research over the past 25 years.
   Research undertaken to date has dealt with the various aspects involved in suicide. It has studied suicides actually committed, suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts among adults and teenagers and men and women among the general and student population. However, work still remains to be done on child populations and hidden populations. It would also be useful to include the gender perspective in research project designs as a means of shedding light on the similarities and differences between men and women. The possibility of moving from descriptive to evaluative research should also be considered, since this would enable one to enter the field of primary prevention (through the identification of protective factors) and secondary prevention (through the identification of risk factors).

AB Suicide is the second cause of death in youth population. The aim of the present study was to analyze demographic characteristics and suicide methods used, as well as to identify gender differences among Mexican children and adolescents (aged 10-17 years) that committed suicide. Between January 2003 and December 2013, 167 suicides of children and adolescents between 10 and 17 years of age were documented by the Secretary of Health of the state of Tabasco, Mexico. All sociodemographic characteristics were compared according to gender. Our sample included 67.7% males and 32.3% females (male to female 2.1:1). The predominant marital status was single (89.6%) and hanging (93.7%) was the principal method of suicide used. Both female and male adolescents were predominantly students (50%); however, female adolescents were more frequently married (17%) and were housewives (26.4%). Our results identified that hanging is the principal suicide method used by children and adolescents in Mexican population; we also detected main gender differences in terms of poisoning/drug toxicity as the method used, occupation and marital status. These results should be taken into consideration when designing suicide prevention programs due to the differences found by gender.

AB Purpose of review
   To present a summary of estimates of the risk of suicidal behaviour (ideation, plan and attempt) among those with substance use disorders in the general population and risk estimates for those with acute alcohol and drug consumption (intoxication) immediately prior to a suicide attempt.
   Recent findings
   In Mexico and elsewhere studies have emerged on the risk of suicidal behaviour among those with substance use disorders that are not affected by treatment selection bias or by psychiatric comorbidity. In developed and developing groups of nations, alcohol use disorders were associated with increased odds ratio (OR) of ideation (range 2.0-2.5) and attempt (2.6-3.7), whereas drug use disorders were associated with increased risk of ideation (2.3-3.0) and attempt (2.0-4.0). Follow-up studies of general population samples reported an OR for drug use disorders from 1.9 to 3.7 for ideation, and an OR of 3.0 for attempt. Alcohol dependence increased suicide ideation with an OR of 1.5. Those drinking alcohol prior to the suicide attempt had ORs in the range of 6.2-9.6. This increase may have a dose-response relationship. We found no studies providing risk estimates for drug use prior to a suicide attempt.
   Summary
   Current evidence points to a causal role of alcohol and drug use disorders exerting a distal effect on suicidal behaviour. Evidence for the proximal role of alcohol and drug use, as triggers of suicidal behaviour, are still very limited in number, analytical techniques and scope of substances other than alcohol.

AB Introduction: Suicide is a serious social and public health problem that affects the population of most countries in the world. Differences in suicide rates have been previously described between rural and urban areas.
   Objective. To study the trend of mortality rates by suicide in Colombia, in rural and urban areas by sex, age group and suicide methods for the period 1979-2014.
   Materials and methods. We conducted an ecological trend study using death certificates from the National Administrative Department of Statistics. Specific and adjusted mortality rates by age and sex were calculated. We estimated negative binomial and inflection points regression models to study the trends in mortality rates stratified by sex, age group and suicide method.
   Results. A total of 56,448 suicides were reported in Colombia between 1979-2014. The risk of suicide was higher in urban areas for men; for individuals between 25-44 years and 65 and over; and for those who used hanging as a suicide method. Also, the risk of suicide was higher in the rural area for men between 45-64 years old and men who used firearms, cutting weapons, hanging and others as suicide methods. Trend of suicide rates in urban areas showed its maximum peak in 1999 and the rural ones in 2000, then in the two areas there was a gradual descent. The hanging in the two areas presented a tendency to rise in men.
   Conclusions. Suicide has shown a tendency toward reduction after the year 2000, with differences between urban and rural areas.

AB Suicide is a worldwide public health problem. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that suicide rates have increased by 60 % in the last forty years. Nowadays, suicide is the second cause of death in the 15-29 year old age bracket. Nonetheless, despite the visibility of the problem, reducing its incidence has proved challenging: there is no reliable method to predict suicide in any single individual. Rather, to curb this phenomenon, WHO recommends adopting population-wide prevention strategies centered around the timely diagnosis and treatment of mental illness. This poses a strain in local public health systems, which are commonly ill-equipped to screen large swats of the population for suicide-related disorders. Thus, recently, interest in finding computer-based solutions to optimize screening has surged. Among these, those based on textual pattern recognition are particularly promising: the extensive use of text communication online provides a rich source of information, where text-based screening methods may be able to flag patients at-risk that may have, otherwise, never been identified. In this work, some recent advances in the discipline are discussed.

AB Objective: To analyse trends in mortality from suicide over the period 1965 - 99.
   Method: Data were derived from the WHO database, including data for 47 countries.
   Results: In the European Union (EU), all age suicide mortality peaked at 16.1/100 000 in men in 1980 - 84, and declined thereafter to 14.4/ 100 000 in 1995 - 98. In females, the fall was 29% to reach 4.6/100 000. A similar pattern of trends was observed in several eastern European countries. In contrast, mortality from suicide rose substantially in the Russian Federation, from 37.7/100 000 in males in 1985 - 89 to 58.3/ 100 000 in 1995 - 98 (+ 55%), and to 9.5/100 000 (+ 12%) in females. In the USA and most other American countries providing data, no consistent pattern was evident for males, but falls were observed in females. Steady declines were registered for Japan, starting from the highest suicide rates worldwide in the late 1950s. Suicide rates were upwards in Ireland, Italy, Spain, the UK, Cuba, Australia and New Zealand. Substantial rises were observed in a few countries ( Ireland, Cuba, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand) for young males.
   Conclusion: In spite of mixed trends, suicide remains a significant public health problem worldwide.

TI Chol Understandings of Suicide and Human Agency
SO CULTURE MEDICINE AND PSYCHIATRY
LA English
DT Article
DE Suicide; Agency; Chol; Personhood; Social change
AB According to ethnographic material collected since 2003, the Chol Mayan indigenous people in southern Mexico have different causal explanations for suicide. It can be attributed to witchcraft that forces victims to take their lives against their own will, to excessive drinking, or to fate determined by God. However, it can also be conceived of as a conscious decision made by a person overwhelmed by daily problems. Drawing from the theoretical framework developed by Laura M. Ahearn, inspired by practice theory, the paper contends that these different explanations operate within two different logics or understandings of human agency. The first logic attributes responsibility to supernatural causes such as witchcraft or divine destiny, and reflects Chol notions of personhood. The second logic accepts personal responsibility for suicide, and is related to processes of social change such as the introduction of wage labor, education and a market economy.

AB Using official data, this study analyzed violent deaths (homicide, suicide, events of undetermined intent and deaths due to legal intervention) in Brazil and Mexico in the three-year periods 2002-2004 and 2012-14, the impact of these causes of death on life expectancy in both countries and the role of the different age groups in years of life expectancy lost (YLEL). Abridged life tables were constructed for both countries for both periods. Temporary life expectancy and YLEL between zero and 80 years by selected causes and age groups were calculated for each triennium. The leading cause of YLEL among men was homicide in both periods in Brazil (1.5 years) and in the second period in Mexico (one year). Violent deaths (VD) accounted for around 16% of YLEL in Brazil and 13% in Mexico in 20122014. Among women, YLEL due to homicides and suicides showed the greatest relative increase in both countries, although VD accounted for barely 3% of total YLEL. The highest percentage of YLEL due to VDwas found among the 15 to 29 year age groups in both countries and for both sexes. The increase in rates of VD in Mexico, above all among young people, has curbed further increases in life expectancy in recent years, especially among men. Likewise, the high rates of VD in Brazil in both periods have hindered the growth of life expectancy.

AB In Mexico, mental disorders have displayed a sharp upward trend. Suicidal conduct is one of the most important mental health problems in the young population, with sexual orientation as a risk factor, since homosexuals show higher probability of suicide as compared to heterosexuals. Suicidal conduct is associated with prior health problems such as depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem, related to predisposing factors like formative experiences with personality. The current study takes a qualitative approach to explore the risk of mental health disorders in homosexuals, associated with suicidal conduct, based on their experience with homophobia in primary and secondary socialization settings. Discourse analysis revealed the relationship interviewees assigned to social rejection of their sexuality and key symptoms of depression ( sadness), anxiety ( fear), and suicidal conduct ( intent and ideation).

AB This article shows the psychometric characteristics of the diagnostic concordance and the internal consistency, according to Beck's Suicide Ideation Scale (BSI), and the identification of the frecuency of the suicide ideation in young adults. It also describes the clinical characteristics of those who present this suicide ideation, according to the BSI criteria from a sample of 122 college students who demanded attention from the Psychiatric Service of the Department of Medical Psychology, Psychiatry and Mental Health of the Medical School at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.
   This was a transversal ex-post-facto study using a non probabilistic sample procedure. The sample was integrated with 122 students 17 to 25 years old. The results showed suicide ideation in 18.9% of the 122 participants, that is in 23 students, 22 of which were also correctly identified by the BSI scale. As for the factorial structure, the scale had four dimensions just as the original BSI scale has: Sub-scale I. Characteristics of their attitudes toward life and death (5 items), formed by one factor, with an internal consistency of alpha = .90. Subscale II: Characteristics of their thoughts and of their desire to commit suicide (5 items), with two factors and an alpha = .65 coefficient in the first one and alpha = .45 in the second; both were integrated in a single dimension. Sub-scale III: Characteristics of the attempt (4 items) with one factor and an internal consistency of alpha = .61. Sub-scale IV: Update of the suicide attempt (2 items), considered as an indicator, and obtaining a coefficient of alpha = .45. Beck's Suicide Ideation Scale (BSI) does not pretend to predict a suicidal attempt in this sample, but it evaluates the intensity of the suicidal desires among those who applied, indicating the presence of suicide risk in a short term. Therefore, its early detection is important in order to prevent it and provide an adequate treatment.

AB Suicide is the second leading cause of death among American Indian youth. Elevated rates of suicide in Indian communities have been attributed both to outbreaks and to regional trends. We assessed the contribution of these two factors for a single tribe, and attempted to define a profile of individuals at risk. Data came from the tribe's registry of suicide attempts and completions for 1990-1993 and analysis of death certificates for the period 1985-1996. Using combined tribal and death certificate data, the average annual (age-adjusted) rate of completed suicide among tribal members was 44.7/100,000 for 1990-1993. Within the 45 suicide deaths and serious attempts in this time period, we identified one grouping of seven cases taking place in a 40-day period. All seven involved hanging and youth (13-28 years old). Using death certificate data alone, the average annual rate of suicide death for non-natives in the surrounding county in the period 1985-1996 was 22.7/100,000. Age-adjusted to the county population, the tribal rate for the same period was not significantly different (24.6/100,000). Tribal and county suicide patterns differed by age distribution and method but not by gender. We concluded that both regional trends and clustering contribute to suicide in this community. Further prevention efforts may need to focus on both unique tribal characteristics and shared factors among non-native neighbors. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Suicide within the Amerindian community of Camopi (1741 inhabitants) in French Guiana has been an increasing problem widely reported in the media leading the French Government to mandate a parliamentary mission to investigate the matter. The purpose of the study was to describe this phenomenon and identify factors associated with suicide attempts. Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted from the health centers' medical records. All suicide attempts and suicides committed between 2008 and 2015 by Amerindians living in Camopi and Trois Sauts were compiled. Contextual factors and suicide representations were also analyzed. Results: During the study period, the annual attempted suicide rate and the suicide rate were higher in the last 3 years. The overall annual rate was equal to 6.9/1741 or 396 per 100, 000 inhabitants for attempted suicide and 172 per 100,000 inhabitants for suicide, which is more than 10 times higher than the suicide rate in mainland France. The mortality rate was 30.4% versus 8.2% in mainland France. The 10-20 year-old age group represented 70% of suicide deaths. There was no significant difference between genders. A recent death and interpersonal conflict were the main stressful life events reported by respondents (55 and 52%, respectively). Alcohol addiction (30% of the respondents) was associated with suicide attempts under the influence of alcohol (p = 0.03). Repetition of suicide attempts was associated with cannabis consumption (p = 0.03). Depression was reported among 45% of the respondents. A third of respondents reported having been abused during their childhood. Over half of respondents reported that their suicide attempt was motivated by a spirit (58%). Conclusions: Despite limitations due to the small population size and limited time frame, this is the first study to describe the epidemiology of suicide among Amerindians living in Camopi. In contrast with other French territories, the suicide rate was very high, the sex ratio was balanced and younger age groups were most affected.

   SUICIDE; INJURY MORTALITY; PREVENTION; POPULATION
AB Background: Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents worldwide, and is a major driver of health inequity among Indigenous people in high-income countries. However, little is known about the burden of suicide among Indigenous populations in low-and middle-income nations, and no synthesis of the global data is currently available. Our objective was to examine the global incidence of suicide among Indigenous peoples and assess disparities through comparisons with non-Indigenous populations.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review of suicide rates among Indigenous peoples worldwide and assessed disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations. We performed text word and Medical Subject Headings searches in PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), PsycINFO, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), and Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO) for observational studies in any language, indexed from database inception until June 1, 2017. Eligible studies examined crude or standardized suicide rates in Indigenous populations at national, regional, or local levels, and examined rate ratios for comparisons to non-Indigenous populations.
   Results: The search identified 13,736 papers and we included 99. Eligible studies examined suicide rates among Indigenous peoples in 30 countries and territories, though the majority focused on populations in high-income nations. Results showed that suicide rates are elevated in many Indigenous populations worldwide, though rate variation is common, and suicide incidence ranges from 0 to 187.5 suicide deaths per 100,000 population. We found evidence of suicide rate parity between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations in some contexts, while elsewhere rates were more than 20 times higher among Indigenous peoples.
   Conclusions: This review showed that suicide rates in Indigenous populations vary globally, and that suicide rate disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations are substantial in some settings but not universal. Including Indigenous identifiers and disaggregating national suicide mortality data by geography and ethnicity will improve the quality and relevance of evidence that informs community, clinical, and public health practice in Indigenous suicide prevention.

ID DEATH REPORTING SYSTEM; UNITED-STATES; INTOXICATION; BEHAVIOR; INJURY
AB BackgroundUsing postmortem data, we examined the hypotheses that high (and very high) blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) are more common among motor vehicle crash decedents (MVCs) than among suicide decedents, whereas low alcohol levels are more common among suicides.
   MethodsWe examined BAC in 224 suicide decedents and 166 MVCs ages 18 to 54 in the state of New Mexico in 2012. Comparisons between the groups were made based on differing BAC levels using 0.080g/dl categories including low (0.001 to 0.079g/dl), high (0.080 to 0.159g/dl), and very high BAC (0.160g/dl), and based on 0.100g/dl categories including low (0.001 to 0.099g/dl), high (0.100 to 0.199g/dl), and very high BAC (0.200g/dl), with these groups compared with a no-alcohol reference (0.000g/dl) in separate analyses. Multivariate logistic regressions compared suicides with MVCs that adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity.
   ResultsSupport for the hypothesis that suicides are more likely to have a low BAC level was supported in the analysis using the 0.100g/dl categorizations. Neither analysis supported the hypothesis that MVCs are more likely to have high (or very high) BACs compared with suicides. Among both injury groups with positive BACs, low BACs were least common.
   ConclusionsLow BAC levels may be more likely to be observed among suicides compared with MVCs, a possible reflection of the more varied role that alcohol plays in suicide compared with MVC. Nonetheless, high (and very high) BAC is the predominant scenario in both suicides and MVCs with positive BAC.

AB The present study reports the multistage development and evaluation of a Spanish translation of the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (INQ). The INQ measures the constructs of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness, which the interpersonal theory of suicide proposes are proximal causes of suicidal desire. Participants were bilingual Hispanic college students in the United States (n = 56), heritage Spanish-speaking college students in the United States (n = 281), college students in Spain (n = 1,016), psychiatric inpatients in Mexico (n = 181), college students in Mexico (n = 239), and Spanish-speaking U.S. adults (n = 104). Results indicated that a 9-item 2-factor solution (INQ-S-9) provided good fit. Multiple group analyses were also consistent with measurement invariance across nationalities and clinical severity. Finally, both subscale scores demonstrated good internal consistency, test-retest reliability, convergent validity, and concurrent associations with scores on measures of suicide ideation. Cultural considerations and implications for use in clinical and research settings are discussed.
   Public Significance Statement
   The present study provides a 9-item Spanish-language version of the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire to promote research on perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness-two robust suicide risk factors-among Hispanic populations. The study details the translation process as well as the factor structure, measurement invariance, reliability, construct validity, and criterion validity of the measure.

AB Investigations of lethal violence in the United States have primarily focused on Whites and/or African Americans, generally ignoring American Indians. Interestingly, statistics indicate that homicide and suicide rates among American Indians are often higher than other racial/ethnic groups within the United States. In an attempt to understand these lethal violence patterns, the current study utilizes the integrated model of suicide and homicide to investigate the structural and cultural factors that contribute to the production and/or direction of American Indian lethal violence. Using data from the Indian Health Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the U.S. Census Bureau, a modified lethal violence count (LVC) is used to examine the production of lethal violence among American Indians within U.S. counties as well as the suicide-homicide ratio (SHR) to unravel the etiological underpinnings of lethal violence. Findings indicate partial support for the integrated model with economic conditions and family disruption influencing these patterns of lethal violence.

ID HOPELESSNESS; DEPRESSION; INVENTORY; VALIDITY
AB Introduction. Risk of Suicide Questionnaire (RSQ) is a useful self-administered tool to assess suicide risk among children. Objetive. The aim of this study was to translate RSQ into Spanish and determine its validity and reliability among Mexican children.
   Method. After a culturally sensitive RSQ items translation, all fifth and sixth grade elementary school students of both genders, from a private educational Institution in Guadalajara (Mexico) whose parents gave informed consent to participate, completed the RSQ Spanish version and the Beek's Depression and Hopelessness Inventories. The parents of the children who had a suicide risk were contacted and invited to come with their child to a subsequent appointment for evaluation and free treatment in the Jalisciense Mental Health Institute. For correlation analysis, item number 9 related to suicide was eliminated.
   Results. A total sample of 88 students participated. Their mean age was 11.23 +/- 0.78 years old, and 55.7% were male. Mean total scales were as follows: RSQ: 8.3 +/- 9.05; depression: 7.4 +/- 6.7, and hopelessness: 18 +/- 3.3. Cronbach's alpha for RSQ was 0.68. Intra class coefficients correlations between RSQ and depression and hopelessness inventories were 0.74 and 0.52, respectively. Only one of the 56 minors considered to have a certain suicide risk (n=56) came to a professional evaluation with their parents.
   Conclusions. The Spanish version of the RSQ showed adequate validity and reliability in Mexican students.

DT Article
DE women; suicide ideation; suicide attempt; depression; phobias; poverty
AB This article presents the results from a study conducted with a representative sample of women living in four low-income communities in southern Mexico City. The objective of the study were the following: learn the prevalence of suicide ideation, suicide attempts, and identify sociodemographic characteristics and affective and anxiety disorders that increase the risk of suicidal ideations and attempts. We conducted home interviews with one person older than 15 years of age per selected home. We requested the voluntary participation of the selected individual and we described the objectives of the research. The obtained results indicated a high prevalence of suicidal ideation, with about 7 out of 100 women having at least once thought about killing themselves. The prevalanece of suicide attempts in the studied population was of 3.6%. Of the women who thought about killing themselves, 36.2% reported depressive symptoms, 29.6% dysthemia, 17.6% phobias. In women who had attempted to kill themselves, the disorders reported with higher frequency were depressive disorders and dysthemia, and in smaller proportions, phobias and other anxiety disorders. We conducted logistic regressions to determine which variables could be considered risk factors for suicide ideations and attempts. The variables identified as risk factors for suicide ideation as well as for attempts were to report depressive disorders (11.62 times higher risk for suicide ideation and 6.9 for attempts) and to be single (1.8 times higher risk for thinking to commit suicide and 1.4 for attempting to kill themselves).

AB To better understand risk factors and populations at risk of childhood fatalities, a review of all records of childhood deaths (19years) between 2000 and 2010 from New Mexico's statewide medical examiner was conducted. Annually, 313383 childhood deaths were investigated (3820 total). Males and American Indians were overrepresented (62% and 20.4% of deaths, respectively). The most common manner of death was natural (44.8%), followed by accidental (31.4%), homicide (8.8%), suicide (8.8%), and undetermined (4.1%). Infants under 1year of age accounted for 41.4% of deaths. Motor vehicle crashes were responsible for the majority of accidental deaths (69%), followed by unintentional overdoses (6.9%), and drowning (5.3%). Gunshot wounds, either intentional or unintentional, caused 10.7% of childhood deaths. Complete medico-legal investigation of childhood fatalities is needed to provide public health agencies with adequate data to evaluate and prevent childhood deaths.

AB Background: Use of alcohol and select other drugs confer risk for injury deaths, yet how such use compares in different types of injury deaths including suicide and fatal motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) is unclear.
   Methods: Individuals in New Mexico ages 18 to 54 that died in 2012 by suicide or MVC were analyzed. Toxicology results were used to code the presence of alcohol and the presence of 1 or more drugs including cocaine, opiate (oxycodone, heroin, etc.), or amphetamine or methamphetamine, yielding a 4-category variable: Alcohol+Drug, Alcohol (without drug), Drug (without alcohol), and Neither (ref). Suicides were compared to MVCs (ref) using unconditional logistic regression analyses adjusted for sex, age, and ethnicity. Poisoning suicides were removed prior to analyses to exclude cases where the drugs may have been used to hasten death.
   Results: Analyses were based on 185 suicides and 161 MVCs. Alcohol+Drug was more likely in suicide decedents, AOR (95% CI)=4.33 (1.70, 11.03). Alcohol (without drug) and Drug (without alcohol) did not differ between the groups. Uniquely, all suicides that were positive for cocaine were also positive for alcohol. As follow-up, similar results were obtained in a post hoc analysis that limited the drug exposure variable to cocaine: Alcohol+Cocaine, AOR (95% CI)=4.69 (1.59, 13.88).
   Conclusions: The co-presence of alcohol and 1 or more drugs of abuse, particularly cocaine, may be more likely in suicide deaths compared to MVCs. Results may inform prevention efforts targeting specific substances and types of injury.

AB In recent years, Mexico has seen one of the largest increases in suicide rates worldwide, especially among adolescents and young adults. This study uses data from the 1,071 respondents who participated in a two-wave longitudinal study when they were between 12 and 17 years of age, and again when they were between 19 and 26 years of age. The World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview assessed suicidal behavior and DSM-IV mental disorders. We used Cox regressions to evaluate which sociodemographic and psychiatric factors and life events predicted the incidence and remission of suicide ideation, plan, and attempt throughout the 8-year span. The 8-year incidence of suicide ideation, plan, and attempt was 13.3%, 4.8%, and 5.9%, respectively. We found that the number of traumatic life events during childhood, no longer being in school, and tobacco use predicted which adolescents developed suicide behaviors as they transitioned into young adulthood. Psychiatric disorders, particularly anxiety disorders, played a larger role in the persistence of those who already had suicidal behaviors, while behavioral disorders played a role in the transition from ideation to attempt. This distinction may be useful for clinicians to assess the risk of suicide.

AB Little is known about the amendment of death certificates (DCs) issued by medical examiners and coroners. This retrospective study examined why, how, and with what frequency cause and manner of death were amended on DCs issued by forensic pathologists over a 6-year period at the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator. Approximately 1% of DCs had either cause or manner of death amendments, with arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease and intoxicants the most commonly amended and resulting causes of death, respectively. There was a significant association between manner of death and number of DCs amended (p < 0.001). By percent, natural and suicide DCs were the most frequently amended. The way in which manner of death changed was significantly associated with the amount of time elapsed between DCs (p=0.04). Toxicology was the most common reason for DC amendment.

In two statesMontana and New Mexicoaid-in-dying has been declared legal neither by directly democratic action by citizens nor by representatively democratic action by the legislature but by court rulings in cases brought by aid-in-dying activists. The court case in New Mexico (Morris v. New Mexico, 2014) is undoubtedly of greater significance to the rest of the states. The Morris opinion is as interesting for what it declined to hold as for what it held.

AB Psychosocial correlates of depression, suicidal ideation and suicide attempt among Mexican adolescents. The objective is to identify correlates of depression, suicidal ideation and suicide attempt in adolescents. 508 males and 428 females, with a mean age of 13.7, from the Center of Mexico City, participated. A self-administered questionnaire was applied. The results indicate that students presenting depression and/or suicidal ideation have higher conflict levels with their father and/or mother, their parents argue over economic problems, lower self-esteem, higher levels of impulsivity, do not have a good relationship with their father and/or mother, and use aggressive coping responses. The prevalence of suicide attempt in men is 7% and in women is 17%. Impulsive women and men had higher risk of previous suicide attempt. For men, aggressive coping responses were associated with higher risk. For women, having a conflictive relationship with the father and/or mother and that the parents argue about economic problems indicated a greater risk. These results could contribute to prevention to identify students at risk to facilitate timely reference to health mental services.

AB Introduction. People living with HIV frequently experience anxiety, depression, hopelessness and suicide risk, particularly if they are hospitalized due to HIV complications. Objective. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of anxiety, depression, hopelessness and suicide risk in HIV+ inpatients at admission and discharge. Method. A comparative study was conducted with the HIV+ inpatient population of the National Institute for Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City, from February to November 2013. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Beck Hopelessness Scale and the Plutchik Suicide Risk Scale were applied at hospital admission and discharge. Results. One hundred and fifteen patients completed all three assessments. Upon admission, 10.4% of the patients scored above the cut-off point for suicide risk; 1.7% presented high levels of hopelessness; 5.2% had clinical depression, and 7% had clinical anxiety. The comparison of scores at admission and discharge showed significant decreases in all symptom levels. Discussion and conclusion. Most of the patients presented low levels of all symptoms assessed at admission and these decreased at discharge. Further research is necessary with the hospitalized HIV population.

AB Would you, as a practicing professional, conduct evaluations of patients desiring physician-assisted suicide (PAS)? Would you assist directly? The authors surveyed psychologists and psychiatrists licensed in New Mexico in order to understand the ethical reasoning mental health practitioners use making judgements about PAS and to discern what criteria they use in responding to patients desiring aid in dying. Fundamental agreement on the validity of various justifications for or against PAS suggests open-mindedness and empathy. Yet, practitioners report a tendency to act in accordance with their own belief systems rather than the patient's, raising questions about objectivity. How do you compare to these professionals?

AB Introduction. The aim of this study was to establish the association between temperament and character personality traits with attempted suicide patients.
   Method. Consecutive male and female adults subjects, between 18-65 years old, presenting a suicide attempt and hospitalized in the Psychiatric Service of Civil Hospital of Guadalajara, Jalisco (Mexico), were evaluated based on Cloninger's Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) and compared with the Mexican normative data.
   Results. A total 63 subjects, with a mean age of 28.25 +/- 9.28 years old, 54% of whom were women, were enrolled. Personality traits associated with suicide attempt in comparison with general population included: temperament: elevation in "novelty seeking" (22.9 +/- 6.0 vs 20.2 +/- 5.1; t = 3.30, df = 83, p = 0.01), "harm avoidance) (19.0 +/- 4.8 vs 12.6 +/- 7.1; t = 8.54, df = 132, p < 0.001), and "self-tramscendence") (19.1 +/- 5.6 vs 16.4 +/- 6.2; t = 3.41, df = 100, p = 0.0009); and character: decrease in "self-directedness") (26.8 +/- 6.2 vs 29.9 +/- 10.8; t = -3.02, df = 16 1, 1) = 0.002), and 4(cooperativeness)) (26.0 +/- 4.5 vs 28.2 +/- 9.9; t = -2.59, df = 214, p = 0.01). Finally, males with suicide attempt showed higher "harm avoidance)) than females (20.37 +/- 5.3 vs 17.82 +/- 4. 1; t = -2.14, df = 6 1, p = 0.036).
   Conclusions. Temperament traits associated with suicide attempt in the present study are related with serotoninergic and noradrenergic deregulation previously involved in the phenomena, and the sum of the character personality dimensions explains the complex relationship between biological and learned factors of suicide behavior.

AB Organized intergroup violence is almost universally modeled as a calculated act motivated by economic factors. In contrast, it is generally assumed that non-economic factors, such as an individual's emotional state, play a role in many types of interpersonal violence, such as "crimes of passion." We ask whether non-economic factors can also explain the well-established relationship between temperature and violence in a unique context where intergroup killings by drug-trafficking organizations (DTOs) and other interpersonal homicides are separately documented. A constellation of evidence, including the limited influence of a cash transfer program as well as comparisons with both other DTO crime and suicides, indicate that economic factors only partially mitigate the relationship between temperature and violence that we estimate in Mexico. We argue that non-economic psychological and physiological factors that are affected by temperature, modeled here as a "taste for violence," likely play an important role in causing both interpersonal and intergroup violence.

AB Previous research reports a significant prevalence of child depression worldwide and self-concept as a predictor of depression and suicide behavior. Although suicide in children is an increasing problem in Mexico, there are scarce studies reporting risk factors and none of children in foster care institutions. This was a comparative, ex post facto study whose aim was to analyze associations between suicidal ideation, depression, and self-concept in two paired samples of Mexican children (83 institutionalized and 83 noninstitutionalized). Results show 16% of the children reported suicidal ideation and statistically significant differences among variables in both samples. Suggestions are made to address this problem from early ages.

AB Introduction
   During the last decade we have observed important climate changes, especially in environmental temperatures. There is considerable information linking the increase in hot weather and human health. For example, hot weather is associated with an increased risk of suicide in different countries around the world.
   Objective
   To evaluate the relationship between suicide rates and the environmental temperature in Baja California Sur, Mexico, from 1985 to 2008.
   Method
   Suicide mortality data for Baja California Sur (BCS) were obtained for the years 1985-2008 from the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica, Geografia e Informatica (INEGI). The selected codes were: E950-E959 (ICD-9) and X60-X84, Y87.0 (ICD-10) for BCS. The BCS weather data used was the maximum temperature from 1985 to 2008, obtained from the Extractor Rapid de Informacion Climatologica (ERIC III). Lineal and quadratic models were used to assess the annual rate changes of suicide and generalized lineal models (GLM) to assess the effect of the climatological variables to the suicide rate. The p <=.05 was considered significant.
   Results
   In BCS, 582 suicide deaths were reported from 1985 to 2008. The 9% (53) of the total reported were women with a yearly average rate 1.6/100 000; 91% (529) were men with a yearly average rate 16.3/100 000. Lineal and quadratic models explained the tendency of the annual increment observed in the number of suicides in both seasons. The quadratic model better explained such increment during the warmer months (R-2=0.64 p<0.01). The temperature was positively correlated with the rate of suicides in both seasons (p<0.01). Two predictive GLMs were created by season.
   Discussion
   These results suggest a potential link between an increase in environmental temperature and the rates of suicide during 24 years in BCS. This relationship is clear during the hot season; however, a positive trend was found during the cold season, perhaps due to the result of warmer winters.

AB Objective: Several studies have shown that acute alcohol use is associated with suicidal behavior, but the magnitude and nature of the relationship remain unclear. We report a study on the impact of acute alcohol use on suicide attempts treated in the emergency room (ER) using the case-crossover design. Method: Seven ER studies carried out in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Australia from 1984 to 1996 with probability samples and similar methodology were merged yielding a total of 102 suicide attempters (overall 52% were male and 59% under 30 years of age). Results: Thirty-six patients reported alcohol use within 6 hours prior to the suicide attempt. When usual alcohol consumption during the past 12 months served as the control value, the estimated relative risk (RR) for patients who reported alcohol use within 6 hours prior to the suicide attempt was 9.6 (95% confidence interval: 5.7-16.3). Although the prevalence of alcohol use differed by sex, there was no statistically significant difference in the estimated RRs (RR = 13.6 men and RR = 5.3 women, p = 0.11 for the heterogeneity test). Conclusions: A positive association was found between alcohol use 6 hours prior and suicide attempts in 102 ER cases in four countries. The case-crossover methodology is well suited to studies for which an external control group is not easily obtainable.

AB Objective: To report results from a follow-up study of alcohol, cannabis and other drugs on suicidal behavior.
   Method: We estimated prospective associations of substance use as a risk factor for incident suicide ideation and attempt, from a follow-up conducted in 2013 (n = 1071) of the original Mexican Adolescent Mental Health Survey conducted in 2005.
   Results: Cannabis use before age 15 (ideation risk ratio (RR) = 3.97; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.43-11.03; attempt RR = 5.23; 95% CI = 1.17-23.32), early onset of DSM-IV drug use disorder (DUD) among cannabis users (ideation RR = 3.30; 95% CI = 1.11-9.84; attempt RR = 4.14; 95% CI = 1.28-13.36), high frequency of cannabis use (RR for attempts = 4.60; 1.03-20.60) and recent DSM-IV-DUD among cannabis users (RR for attempts = 4.74; 1.09-20.57) increased the RR. For "other drug use", significant results were found among those with high frequency use of other drugs such that they had a higher RR of suicide attempt (5.04; 1.03-24.64). For alcohol, only those who initiated alcohol before age 15 had higher RRs of suicide attempt (1.79; 1.00-3.20).
   Discussion: Those who used cannabis at an early age, early onset of DSM-IV-DUD, and those with heavy cannabis use and recent DSM-IV-DUD among cannabis users in the last 12-months had increased risk of suicide ideation and attempt. Drugs other than cannabis showed some of these associations, but to a lesser degree. Prevention of substance use and treatment of those already engaged in drug use, by decreasing suicide ideation and attempt, may help to prevent suicide in Mexico. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Geospatial, racial, and educational variation in firearm mortality in
   the USA, Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia, 1990-2015: a comparative analysis
   of vital statistics data
SO LANCET PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID UNITED-STATES; DEATH RATES; SUICIDE
AB Background Firearm mortality is a leading, and largely avoidable, cause of death in the USA, Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia. We aimed to assess the changes over time and demographic determinants of firearm deaths in these four countries between 1990 and 2015.
   Methods In this comparative analysis of firearm mortality, we examined national vital statistics data from 1990-2015 from four publicly available data repositories in the USA, Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia. We extracted medically-certified deaths and underlying population denominators to calculate the age-specific and sex-specific firearm deaths and the risk of firearm mortality at the national and subnational level, by education for all four countries, and by race or ethnicity for the USA and Brazil. Analyses were stratified by intent (homicide, suicide, unintentional, or undetermined). We quantified avoidable mortality for each country using the lowest number of subnational age-specific and period-specific death rates.
   Findings Between 1990 and 2015, 106-3 million medically-certified deaths were recorded, including 2 472 000 firearm deaths, of which 851 000 occurred in the USA, 272 000 in Mexico, 855 000 in Brazil, and 494000 in Colombia. Homicides accounted for most of the firearm deaths in Mexico (225 000 [82.7%]), Colombia (463 000 [93.8%]), and Brazil (766 000 [89.5%]). Suicide accounted for more than half of all firearm deaths in the USA (479000 [56.3%]). In each country, firearm mortality was highest among men aged 15-34 years, accounting for up to half of the total risk of death in that age group. During the study period, firearm mortality risks increased in Mexico and Brazil but decreased in the USA and Colombia, with marked national and subnational geographical variation. Young men with low educational attainment were at increased risk of firearm homicide in all four countries, and in the USA and Brazil, black and brown men, respectively, were at the highest risk. The risk of firearm homicide was 14 times higher in black men in the USA aged 25-34 years with low educational attainment than comparably-educated white men (1.52% [99% CI 1-50-1.54] vs 0.11% [0.10-0.12]), and up to four times higher than in comparably-educated men in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico. In the USA, the risk of firearm homicide was more than 30 times higher in black men with post-secondary education than comparably educated white men. If countries could achieve the same firearm mortality rates nationally as in their lowest-burden states, 1 777 800 firearm deaths at all ages and in both sexes could be avoided, including 1 028 000 deaths in men aged 15-34 years.
   Interpretation Firearm mortality in the USA, Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia is highest among young adult men, and is strongly associated with race and ethnicity, and low education levels. Reductions in firearm deaths would improve life expectancy, particularly for black men in the USA, and would reduce racial and educational disparities in mortality. Copyright (C) 2019 The Author(s).

AB Objective. To describe the relationship established by a male homosexual group between the perception of social rejection towards their homosexuality, sexual practices and risk of HIV/AIDS. Material and Methods. In-depth interviews were administered to homosexual men at a Mexico City university by means of a snowball technique. The interviews were recorded and processed with Atlas.ti software and the analysis of the discourse was made using the Grounded Theory method. Results. The experience of homophobia as expressed by the interviewees resulted in psychological suffering, including sadness,fear, loneliness and suicidal behavior associated with risk situations for HIV/AIDS. Conclusions. Homophobia, translated into discrimination, contributes to an increased vulnerability to the sexual transmission of HIV

AB A fatal concentration of pentobarbital found in a coroner's case where the history had not indicated use of this drug prompted a review of fatalities in Ontario from 2012 to 2015. Coroner's case files, including police and toxicology reports, were reviewed in twenty deaths, in which pentobarbital was identified as the primary cause of death. In all of the deaths (11 females, 9 males), the blood concentration of pentobarbital was greater than 10 mg/L. There were three to eight deaths per year and each was classified as suicide. In 11 cases, there was clear evidence that the drug was purchased over the internet from Mexico or China and imported into Canada. In four cases, it appears that the pentobarbital was labeled as a different, innocuous chemical to facilitate crossing the border without scrutiny. The findings underscore the value of a thorough scene investigation, including details of evidence that may be considered unrelated.

AB This comparative survey contrasted 571 parents who lost children to various death causes: 48 to drug-related deaths and overdoses, 462 to suicide, 24 to natural death cases, and 37 to mostly accidental death cases. Groups were compared in terms of grief difficulties, mental health problems, post-traumatic stress, and stigmatization. Results did not show any appreciable differences in these respects between the suicide bereaved parents and those losing children to drug-related deaths. However, when the suicide and drug-related death survivors were specifically contrasted against accidental and natural death loss cases, a consistent pattern emerged showing the former group was consistently more troubled by grief and mental health problems than the latter two sub-groups. These differences remained when controls of time since the loss and gender differences were employed as covariates. These findings suggest that the powerful and intense stigma against drug use and mental illness, shared among the public-at-large, imposes challenges in healing of immense proportion for these parents as they find less compassionate responses from their significant others, following their losses.

AB Objective The aim of the present study was to analyse demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as psychiatric diagnoses to identify gender differences in patients with attempted suicide in a Mexican population.
   Methods Between September 2010 and September 2012, 140 suicide attempts were documented in the Department of Psychiatry at the General Hospital of Comalcalco (Hospital General de Comalcalco in Spanish) in Tabasco, Mexico. Diagnoses were established using the DSM-IV questionnaire in which Axis I and II were considered. The Suicide Intent Scale was also applied.
   Results In our sample, 63.6% were females and 36.4% males. With regard to socio-demographic characteristics, the predominant marital status in males was single, and in females married ((2)=5.93, df=2, p=0.05). In occupation the male group was mainly unemployed and housewife in females ((2)=55.51, df=4, p<0.001). Male subjects were more likely to consume alcohol ((2)=20.40, df=1, p0.001), cannabis ((2)=16.62, df=1, p0.001) or tobacco. The prevalence of psychiatric diagnosis was significantly different because, the male group was mainly diagnosed with substance-related disorders, whereas female participants showed a prevalence of stress-related disorders ((2)=34.17, gl=4, p=0.0001).
   Conclusion Our results provide evidence that the characteristics of suicide attempt are different by gender in the Mexican population. Interventions are necessary for the development of prevention strategies that may lead to a reduction in suicidal behaviour. These preventive activities should consider the occupation for the female group and consumption of alcohol, cannabis or tobacco in the male group.

AB Background Cross-national comparisons of injury mortality can suggest possible causal explanations for injuries across different countries and cultures. This study identifies differences in injury mortality between Los Angeles (LA) County, California and Mexico City DF, Mexico.
   Methods Using LA County and Mexico City death certificate data for 1994 and 1995, injury deaths were classified according to the International Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision-Clinical Modification external cause of injury codes. Crude, gender-, and age-adjusted annual fatality rates were calculated and comparisons were made between the two regions.
   Results Overall and age-adjusted injury death rates were higher for Mexico City than for LA County. Injury death rates were found to be higher for young adults in LA County and for elderly residents of Mexico City. Death rates for motor vehicle crashes, falls, and undetermined causes were higher in Mexico City, and relatively high rates of poisoning, homicide, and suicide were found for LA County. Motor vehicle crash and fall death rates in Mexico City increased beginning at about age 55, while homicide death rates were dramatically higher among young adults in LA County. The largest proportion of motor vehicle crash deaths was to motor vehicle occupants in LA County and to pedestrians in Mexico City.
   Conclusions These findings illustrate the importance of primary injury prevention in countries having underdeveloped trauma care systems and should aid in setting priorities for future work. The high frequency of pedestrian fatalities in Mexico City may be related to migration of rural populations, differing vehicle characteristics and traffic patterns, and lack of safety knowledge. Mexico City's higher rate of fall-related deaths may be due to concurrent morbidity from chronic conditions, high-risk environments, and delay in seeking medical treatment.

AB Introduction
   Disturbed sleep is a public health problem, but few studies describe the prevalence of sleep problems among Hispanic adolescents. We estimated the prevalence of disturbed sleep and associated factors among ninth graders living on the Texas-Mexico border.
   Methods
   We used probabilistic sampling to conduct 2 cross-sectional, school-based surveys: 1 during the 2000-2001 school year in the Lower Rio Grande Valley, Texas (n = 4,901), and 1 during the 2002-2003 school year in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico (n = 669). We assessed disturbed sleep during the 4 weeks before the survey.
   Results
   The prevalence of disturbed sleep in Matamoros was 36% and in the Lower Rio Grande Valley was 28%. Factors associated with disturbed sleep in both populations were smoking cigarettes, having ever used cocaine, having been forced to have sex, considering attempting suicide, feeling sad, and going without eating for 24 hours or more.
   Conclusion
   This study revealed a high prevalence of disturbed sleep in high school students living on the Texas-Mexico border. This public health issue should be further investigated in both communities.

AB The purpose of the present study is to determine if connection with female (FC) and male caregivers (MC) could buffer the negative effects of intergenerational acculturative conflict (IAC) on suicide risk among Mexican descent adolescents and emerging adults. The sample included 722 Mexican descent adolescents and emerging adults (age range: 14-25 years, M = 19.69; SD = 1.75) from a U.S. high school and public university located near the United States-Mexico border. The majority of the sample were women (65.9%) and born in the United States (92.8%). Data were collected via self-report measures. The significant findings of linear regression analyses were: 1) Higher MC-IAC was related to higher levels of past year suicide risk, while higher levels of FC and MC connection were related to lower levels; and 2) Both MC and FC connection protected youth against the negative impact of IAC on suicide risk. Results are discussed in terms of the importance of both the MC and FC relationship quality in the context of IAC on suicide risk among Latinx youth. Suggestions will be made to include both MC and FC caregivers in research, prevention, and intervention efforts.

   BEHAVIOR; RISK; NEUROBIOLOGY; DEPRESSION; DISORDERS; ABUSE
AB One current problem in Public Health relates to suicide and the identification of the risk factors needs to be clarified accurately. The bases of suicide involve complex multiple factors. In a high proportion of nations, mainly in industry-developing countries, suicide is placed among the first three causes of death in groups aged from 15 to 34 years. In Mexico, suicide represents the ninth cause of mortality, within a wide scale of age ranging from 15 to 64 years.
   Some risk factors have been identified. Epidemiological studies show that males commit suicide more frequently than females, in a proportion of 5:1. Consummate suicide occurs in men about 50 years old, mainly by hanging or fire arms. Females between 20 and 29 years old, on the contrary, carry out more frequent unsuccessful attempts in the same proportion, by using pesticides and medical drugs. However, in recent years an increase in the number of suicides among young people from 15 to 24 years old has been observed, commonly in low-income sectors, in subjects with a previous history of psychiatric disorders, mainly personality disorders, abuse of substances and prior suicidal attempts. The risk of suicide generally increases after 45, and becomes especially serious in older people. The phenomenon of suicide in the elderly deserves special attention, due to the fact that the population over 65 years old is continuously increasing. This group displays fewer attempts than youths, but they achieve their aim more often through a silent suicide, by refusing to eat or tc accept and follow medical prescriptions.
   Some psychiatric disturbances are intimately related to suicide. It is considered that 50% or more of the consummate suicides are performed by people suffering from an affective disorder, mainly depression. In this sense, it is noteworthy that most of these patients had been misdiagnosed and in many cases had not received any proper treatment. In addition, the abuse of or dependence on alcohol is present in about 20% of consummate suicides, and high rates of suicide are also observed in schizophrenia. Another common disturbance associated with suicide is anxiety. The simultaneous presence of anxiety and depression must be considered as a great risk factor, since the depressed patient has a high risk of committing suicide under phases of increased anxiety. All of these observations imply an alert signal for medical care units concerning the importance of detecting signs of the presence of risk factors and suicidal ideation, and of implementing adequate therapeutic management, namely, a supervised pharmacological treatment of depression and anxiety including hospitalization, if it were the case.
   The risk factors in potential suicide include isolation, poor health, depression, alcoholism, lowered self-esteem, despair and feelings of social and family refusal. Frequently, the potential suicide directly or indirectly gives behavioral and verbal cues of his or her suicidal intention. Roughly, 60% of the victims of suicide had attended some medical care unit in the month previous to the suicide and had commented something about their desires and feelings about death at some moment, and 30% had clearly revealed their suicidal ideation. For such reason, the evaluation of risk of the potentially suicidal patient should be a common practice in medical care units. Therefore, the early detection of the presence of risk factors of suicide, including the report of self-harm and of a detectable incapacity for solving problems, mainly of social type may provide an invaluable time to permit its prevention.
   Another current aspect awaiting conclusive evidence is associated with some controversial data regarding the impact that the use of antidepressants could have upon suicide. The Food and Drug Administration office (USA) pointed out that deficiencies in information do not allow to confirm an), existing relation between the use of serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and suicide in youths. The suicidal risk after initiating the treatment is similar in the patient receiving tricyclics, or serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors. The risk of suicide can increase significantly in the first month of antidepressant treatment, especially during the first nine days. Consequently, the observation that patients receiving antidepressants attempt suicide, is due, at least partly, to the fact that for still unknown reasons, antidepressants require from three to four weeks of impregnation to attain clear therapeutic effects.
   Therefore, it is indispensable to carry out further clinical and experimental studies to determine the variables that could be implied in this time lag in the action of antidepressants. However, fluoxetine represents a useful alternative in the management of depressive disorders; albeit as in the case of other antidepressants, it requires a strict follow-up of the patient receiving such treatments to avoid the risk of a fatal complication.
   In conclusion, the suicide risk, being a serious problem of public health, requires special attention. Recent research indicates that the prevention of suicide includes a series of activities, such as educational programs for children and youths, teachers and educators, and also primary health care units for the early detection of suicide risk factors. And, of course, medical training for the management of the potential suicide.
   For all of them, some relevant facts must be taken into account:
   1) Depression can be present in children and adolescents.
   2) Access to means of committing suicide, such as weapons, must be avoided.
   3) People from medical care units should be on the alert when any one shows signs and symptoms of despair and impulsiveness.
   4) Suicide, anxiety and depression have a biological basis; therefore it is not a matter of cowardice or an act of defiance.
   5) An inadequate and inopportune diagnosis may increase the suicidal risk.
   6) Parents and teachers should be instructed to detect any sign of suicidal ideation and despair. Therefore, this revision intends to bring some recent data to bear upon the factors of the risk of suicide that provide the reader with information for a more effective prevention.

AB Marsden Hartley and Hart Crane knew each other via their acquaintance with Alfred Stieglitz and his gallery 291 during the early twenties. 'they met again in Mexico where both held fellowships to paint and write in search of a more original, more "primitive" culture. Both were ambiguously attracted to the "death culture" of Mexico and the rituals that were part of it. Crane's suicide by drowning on the way back to the U.S. deeply disturbed the elder painter who had often thought of suicide himself and saw in Crane (like him a homosexual) a mirror-image of his own fate. In commemoration of him he wrote a lengthy poem ("Un Recuerdo- Herman()- Hart Crane R.I.P.") and painted a mysteriously beautiful picture: "Eight Bells Folly, Memorial for Hart Crane" (1933) which echoes Crane's "Voyages." I shall discuss and interrelate both their poems and Hartley's painting (itself an interpretation of Crane's sea poetry), outlining a symbolic territory of death, love and desire that poet and painter shared.

AB Objective. To identify the prevalence of and factors associated with suicidal ideation and intent in adolescent students in Mexico. Material and Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 12 424 students from public schools in 2007. We used logistic regression to obtain odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals. Results. A total of 47% of the students reported at least one suicidal ideation symptom and 9% reported an antecedent of suicidal intent. Factors associated with suicide ideation and intent include low confidence in communication with parents (OR = 1.30; OR=1.54), sexual abuse (OR=1.92; OR=1.57), depressive symptoms (OR=5.36; OR=1.51), tobacco use (OR=1.30; OR=2.57), alcohol use (OR=1.60; OR=1.31) and, for women, having had sexual relations (OR=1.28; OR=1.65). Conclusions. Roughly 50% of high school students had at least one symptom of suicidal ideation. To lessen this problem, associated factors should be considered, including consumption of addictive substances, gender, history of sexual abuse and depression.

AB Backgound. In order to reduce the treatment gap of mental disorders, the World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed the mhGAP guidelines to be implemented globally.
   Aim of the study. To examine the effectivity of a training course based on the WHO-mhGAP guidelines to increase knowledge and readiness for identification and management of depression and suicide risk in primary care (PC) in Mexico.
   Methods. PC clinicians were invited to participate in a traning course; before and after it, all completed an evaluation of knowledge of mhGAP and depression (0-10 points), and self-efficacy in suicide risk management (0-40 points), and were classified according to Prochaska and Diclemente transtheorical model in their particular stage of readiness for identification and management of these conditions.
   Results. The sample included 60 health professionals. Before training, clinicians had adequate knowledge of depression and its treatment (8.1 +/- 1.66), but not on the mhGAP model and/or suicide risk management, which increased by the end of training (mhGAPpre:7.91 +/- 2.19 vs. mhGAPpost:8.77 +/- 1.34, p = 0.01; SuicidePRE:29.16 +/- 9.35 vs. SuicidePOST:39.24 +/- 6.83, p = 0.0001). Before training, most clinicians were at the contemplation stage (42.6% vs. 37.7% at the action and 19.7% at the precontemplation stage). By the end of the training, a decrease in the number of clinicians at both the contemplation and precontemplation stages (to 36.1% and to zero, respectively) and a significant increase of clinicians at the action stage (to 63.9%) was observed. Conclusions: A training course based on the WHO-mhGAP could be an effective tool for increasing PC clinicians' willingness to implement mental health services. (C) 2019 IMSS.

AB Objective: To estimate the burden of mental, neurological, substance use disorders and self-harm (MNSS) in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Method: We extracted 2017 data from the Global Burden of Disease online database. Based on a previously developed framework to classify and aggregate the burden of specific disorders and symptoms, we reestimated the MNSS burden to include suicide, alcohol use, drug use, specific neurological, and painful somatic symptom disorders. We analyzed age-sex-specific patterns within and between countries. Results: The MNSS burden is the largest of all disorder groupings. It is lowest in Mexico, intermediate in Canada, and highest in the United States. Exceptions are alcohol use, bipolar, conduct disorders, and epilepsy, which are highest in Mexico; and painful somatic syndromes and headaches, which are highest in Canada. The burden of drug use disorders in the United States is twice the burden in Canada, and 7 times the burden in Mexico. MNSS become the most burdensome of all disorder groups by age 10, staying at the top until age 60, and show a distinct pattern across the lifetime. The top three MNSS disorders for men are a combination of substance use disorders and self-harm (United States), with the addition of painful somatic syndromes (Canada), and headaches (Mexico). For women, the top three are headaches and depression (all countries), drug use (United States), neurocognitive disorders (Mexico), and painful somatic syndromes (Canada). Conclusion: MNSS are the most burdensome disease grouping and should be prioritized for funding in Canada, Mexico, and the United States.

AB ObjectivesTo report worldwide trends in suicidemortality during a period that covers 7years after the 2008 global crisis.MethodsWe performed a time trend analysis with joinpoint regression.ResultsOver the 2000s, suicide mortality decreased with the largest declines observed in some Eastern European countries. The downward trends were followed by an increase in concomitance with the 2008 global crisis in some countries, including Greece (annual percentage change=+6 in men and +11.8 in women), the Netherlands (+4.2 in men and +4.0 in women), and the UK (+1.6 in men), while the pre-crisis downward trends stopped in Germany, Italy, and Spain. The joinpoint analysis also revealed long-term rises in Brazil (+0.8 since 1990 in men and +1.8 since 1999 in women), Mexico (+1.3 since 1995 in men and +3.6 since 1990 in women), the USA (+1.7 since 2005 in men and +4.2 since 2010 in women), and Australia (+1.8 in men and +3.7 in women, since 2006 in both sexes).ConclusionsDespite downward trendsin several areas of the world, in some countries suicide rates increased since the 2008 global crisis.

TI Suicide and drug-related mortality following occupational injury

   COMPENSATION; DISABILITY; HEALTH; DEPRESSION; DISORDERS
AB Background Drug overdoses and suicides have been rising since 2000 and are major contributors to a 3-year decline in US life expectancy. Studies suggest that injured workers have elevated rates of depression and opioid use, but no studies have measured excess mortality related to these risks. Materials and methods We linked New Mexico workers' compensation data for 100 806 workers injured in 1994 through 2000 with Social Security Administration earnings and mortality data through 2013 and National Death Index cause of death data. We then estimated the association between receiving lost-time workers' compensation benefits and mortality hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on Fine and Gray cause-specific subdistribution hazards for common causes of death and for drug-related, suicide, and alcohol-related mortality. Results There was almost a 3-fold increase in combined drug-related and suicide mortality hazard among women (HR = 2.63, 95% CI = 1.91-3.64) and a substantial increase among men (HR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.13-1.79). Circulatory disease mortality hazard was elevated for men (HR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.05-1.50). Conclusion Workplace injuries severe enough to require more than a week off work may impair workers' long-term health and well-being. Drug-related deaths and suicides may be important contributors to the long-term excess mortality of injured workers. Improved workplace conditions, improved pain treatment, better treatment of substance use disorders, and treatment of postinjury depression may substantially reduce mortality consequent to workplace injuries.

TI Variable Classification of Drug-Intoxication Suicides across US States:
   A Partial Artifact of Forensics?
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID OF-DEATH ANALYSIS; UNITED-STATES; UNDETERMINED DEATHS; MEDICAL
   EXAMINERS; PUBLIC-HEALTH; MORTALITY; CORONERS; MISCLASSIFICATION;
   TRENDS; COMORBIDITY
AB Background
   The 21st-century epidemic of pharmaceutical and other drug-intoxication deaths in the United States (US) has likely precipitated an increase in misclassified, undercounted suicides. Drug-intoxication suicides are highly prone to be misclassified as accident or undetermined. Misclassification adversely impacts suicide and other injury mortality surveillance, etiologic understanding, prevention, and hence clinical and public health policy formation and practice.
   Objective
   To evaluate whether observed variation in the relative magnitude of drug-intoxication suicides across US states is a partial artifact of the scope and quality of toxicological testing and type of medicolegal death investigation system.
   Methods
   This was a national, state-based, ecological study of 111,583 drug-intoxication fatalities, whose manner of death was suicide, accident, or undetermined. The proportion of (nonhomicide) drug-intoxication deaths classified by medical examiners and coroners as suicide was analyzed relative to the proportion of death certificates citing one or more specific drugs and two types of state death investigation systems. Our model incorporated five sociodemographic covariates. Data covered the period 2008-2010, and derived from NCHS's Multiple Cause-of-Death public use files.
   Results
   Across states, the proportion of drug-intoxication suicides ranged from 0.058 in Louisiana to 0.286 in South Dakota and the rate from 1 per 100,000 population in North Dakota to 4 in New Mexico. There was a low correlation between combined accident and undetermined drug-intoxication death rates and corresponding suicide rates (Spearman's rho =0.38; p<0.01). Citation of 1 or more specific drugs on the death certificate was positively associated with the relative odds of a state classifying a nonhomicide drug-intoxication death as suicide rather than accident or undetermined, adjusting for region and type of state death investigation system (odds ratio, 1.062; 95% CI, 1.016-1.110). Region, too, was a significant predictor. Relative to the South, a 10% increase in drug citation was associated with 43% (95% CI, 11%-83%), 41% (95% CI, 7%-85%), and 33% (95% CI, 1%-76%) higher odds of a suicide classification in the West, Midwest, and Northeast, respectively.
   Conclusion
   Large interstate variation in the relative magnitude of nonhomicide drug-intoxication deaths classified as suicide by medical examiners and coroners in the US appears partially an artifact of geographic region and degree of toxicological assessment in the case ascertainment process. Etiologic understanding and prevention of drug-induced suicides and other drug-intoxication deaths first require rigorous standardization involving accurate concepts, definitions, and case ascertainment.

AB Aims: To examine whether the association between prevalence measures of suicidality and substance abuse/dependence among adolescents (1) is attenuated when temporal priority of exposure and outcome are taken into account, (2) extends to substance use (i.e. without disorder), (3) applies to tobacco use and dependence independent of illicit drugs and alcohol use/disorder, and (4) is confounded by comorbid mental illness.
   Design: Discrete-time survival models were applied to retrospectively reported age of onset of first suicidal ideation, plan and attempt and age of onset of first substance use and disorder. Participants: 3005 adolescents aged 12-17 residing in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area in 2005.
   Measurements: The World Mental Health computer-assisted adolescent version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to assess suicidal outcomes and psychiatric disorders including substance dependence/abuse.
   Findings: Use of and dependence on tobacco is as strong a predictor of subsequent suicidality as is use of and dependence with abuse of alcohol and drugs. The association between substance use and subsequent suicidality is not fully accounted for by comorbid mental illness.
   Conclusion: Efforts to reduce the use as well as the abuse of alcohol, drugs and tobacco may help reduce the risk of subsequent suicidal behaviors among adolescents in Mexico. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective. To describe the external causes of death and mortality trends due to injuries and poisoning in Mexican adolescents, from 1979 to 1997. Material and Methods. This is a descriptive study of deaths occurring in Mexico from 1979 to 1997. Data were abstracted, coded, and entered in electronic format, by Instituto Nacional de Estadstica, Geografia e Informatica (National Institute of Statistics, Geography, and Informatics, INEGI), Data were analyzed during the second half of year 2000, in Jalisco, at the Research Unit of Epidemiologic and Adolescent Health Services, of Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Institute of Social Security, IMSS). Results. Injuries and poisoning ranked first as causes of adolescent mortality in Mexico (rate= 13.35/100,000), decreasing 41,4% from 1979 to 1997. However, an increasing trend was observed for homicides and suicides (9.5% y 104,0%, respectively). The most frequent mechanisms of injury were: motor vehicles, firearms, intoxications, suffocation, and drowning. Conclusions. Injuries and poisoning in developing countries show differences from those reported in developed countries, Further studies should be conducted to find preventive measures consistent with the sociocultural and environmental determinants of injuries and poisoning.

AB Introduction
   Poisoning remains a major worldwide public health problem. Mortality varies by country, region and ethnicity. The objective of this study is to analyze recent trends in poisoning mortality in the Mexican population.
   Methods
   Data regarding mortality induced by poisoning was obtained from a publicly available national database maintained by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography.
   Results
   During the period from 2000 to 2012, average mortality rates for unintentional and self-poisoning were 1.09 and 0.41 per 100000 population, respectively. The highest mortality rate for unintentional poisoning was in older individuals of both genders while the highest mortality for self-poisoning was in older men and young women. Additional studies are needed in Mexico, especially those that analyze risk factors in older individuals and young women.

AB Land degradation is frequently cited as a factor in the collapse of ancient complex societies. Implicit in these tales of ecological suicide is the assumption that land degradation is an ecological rather than a social problem. Here, I discuss how land degradation can be reconceptualized as a social-environmental dialectic. I then discuss the implications of this perspective using evidence from a recent landscape project exploring diachronic relationships between environmental and social transformations in the development of the Precolumbian Tarascan (Purepecha) empire, centered in the Lake Patzcuaro Basin, Mexico. Project findings challenge common conceptions regarding the impact of agriculture, urbanism, and state collapse on ancient landscapes, as well as the dating of the most serious episodes of degradation.

AB Research has consistently demonstrated a relationship between history of forced sex and poor behavioral health outcomes. The objectives of this study were to describe this relationship among high school students and to explore the impact of resiliency factors. Using data from the 2013 New Mexico Youth Risk and Resiliency Survey, we found that history of forced sex was associated with negative behavioral health outcomes for males and females, regardless of sexual orientation and disability status. Furthermore, the presence of a caring adult at home appeared to reduce the risk of substance abuse and suicidality among students with and without a history of forced sex.

TI Attempted suicide among adolescents in Mexico: prevalence and associated

SO INJURY PREVENTION
LA English
DT Article
ID HEALTH
AB Objective To determine the prevalence and associated factors of attempted suicide (AS) in a sample of Mexican adolescents between 10 and 19 years of age.
   Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted with data from the 2012 National Health and Nutrition Survey (ENSANUT 2012 by its initials in Spanish). Based on multi-stage stratified probability sampling, ENSANUT 2012 canvassed 50 528 households including 21 519 adolescents. A logistic regression model was used to identify the factors associated with AS. The model was selected based on the maximum likelihood test.
   Results Lifetime prevalence of AS amounted to 2.7% and was heterogeneously distributed across Mexico. Women showed significantly higher risk for AS than men (OR A (adjusted OR)) 6.3, 95% confidence interval CI 4.94 to 8.06), and individuals who experienced damage to health caused by violence over the last 12 months were 4.35 times (OR A 4.35, 95% CI 3.27 to 5.80) more likely to engage in AS than those who did not. The likelihood of engaging in AS was 1.5 times higher (OR A 1.5 (95% CI 1.12 to 2.01)) among subjects with mild and 4.22 times higher (95% CI 3.21 to 5.54) among subjects with moderate eating disorders compared to those with no eating disorders. Other AS-associated factors included age, smoking, consuming alcohol and living with relatives other than parents.
   Conclusions Awareness of the risk factors associated with AS can help identify the populations who are exposed to injury or death by suicide. This can orient the actions of the health sector towards those who are most vulnerable. Actions must be matched by more qualitative and quantitative research on the subject.

AB Introduction. In Mexico, as in other countries, studies do not distinguish between attempted suicide and suicidal and nonsuicida I self-injury (NSSI). The aim of this study was to investigate self-injury and its prevalence using several definitions, in addition to studying the frequency of the proposed DSM-5 criteria for NSSI in adolescent girls and boys.
   Methodology. The study was observational, descriptive, cross-sectional, and comparative using a nonrandomized sample of adolescent girls and boys from official high schools who completed the self-injury questionnaire.
   Results. The participants were 533 older children and adolescents with a mean (SD) age of 13.37 (0.95) years, age range 11 to 17 years, and 54% female sex distribution.
   The prevalence of NSSI defined according to proposed DSM-5 criteria was 5.6% (N=30) and, according to a broad definition using only item 51 ("Do you hurt yourself without intending to end your life?"), 17.1% (N=140). Prevalence defined by the number of events in the last month (1-3 events) was 9.90% (N=53), in the last 6 months (1-3 events), 11.6% (N=62), and in the last year (5 events), 12.6% (N=67). The age at onset was 11.9 (1.39) years (range 6-15 years). Most DSM-5 criteria were more frequent in girls than boys.
   Conclusions. Suicidal and nonsuicidal self-injury are frequent in the community. Important points for decision-making in schools and medical practice are discussed.

AB Background: We report the lifetime and 12-month prevalence and associations of mental health treatment among Mexican adolescents with suicide-related outcomes (SROs; including ideation, plans, gestures and attempts).
   Methods: A representative multistage probability household survey of 3005 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years residing in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area was carried out in 2005. Discrete-time survival analyses were used to assess the relationships between SROs and receiving treatment for emotional, alcohol, or drug problems.
   Results: The prevalence of lifetime service use among respondents with SROs was 35% for those with ideation only, 44% for those with ideation and plan, 49% for those with gesture and 50% for those with attempt; the prevalence of 12-month service use was 10%, 24%, 6% and 21%, respectively. Timing between onset of SRO and receiving treatment for emotional, alcohol, or drug problems showed that about 50% of adolescents will have contact with a service provider before developing any SRO. Healthcare professionals were the most likely to be consulted, followed by school-based programs.
   Limitations: This survey was limited to adolescents living in one of the largest metropolitan areas in the world and the analyses used data on retrospectively reported ages of onset that are subject to recall errors.
   Conclusions: Most suicidal adolescents do not receive treatment, and many adolescents develop their suicidality in spite of prior contacts with service providers. Interventions to increase treatment, prevention, and monitoring are sorely needed for this vulnerable population. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background. Depression is highly prevalent worldwide, and may have fatal consequences. Violence is associated to psychopathology and has exponentially increased in some areas of Mexico. Healthcare professionals are vulnerable to increased anxiety, depression, suicide and lately, to violence by organized crime. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of anxiety/depression/suicidal ideation and the weight of social violence as a risk factor.
   Methods. Cross sectional study in three generations of undergraduate medical students at entry to internship year in our institution. All students voluntarily agreed to participate. All of them answered Beck and HAM-A. Two generations also responded Plutchik suicidal risk inventory. Sex, type of university and degree of violence in their geographic areas were also recorded. Prevalence rates were calculated for each outcome. chi(2) tests and odds ratio (OR) for bivariate analysis, and Mantel-Hanezel to adjust according to level of violence.
   Results. All of the eligible students responded the anxiety and inventories (n = 8,858), and 6,451 also responded the suicide risk test. Overall, 37.2% displayed severe anxiety, 14.9% moderate/severe depression and 8.5% suicidal ideation. Female sex and private university increased the risk for anxiety and depression. High violence, severe anxiety or depression increased the risk for suicidal ideation. Adjusted by violence zone, female sex, being single and the coexistence of depression were associated with a higher risk for suicidal ideation.
   Conclusions. Anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation are highly prevalent among premedical interns in Mexico. Living in highly violent areas significantly increases the risk for anxiety/depression/suicidal ideation. (C) 2020 IMSS. Published by Elsevier Inc.

ID SUICIDE; FIREARM; LAW; HOMICIDE; RATES
AB After a recent increase in violence, policy makers and advocates in Mexico have proposed new firearm legislation that would shift Mexican gun policies towards a more permissive approach. Following the argument of 'self-defense', these initiatives would facilitate citizens' access to guns by allowing them to carry firearms in automobiles and businesses. These initiatives have been developed without a deep analysis of the effects of permissive gun laws. In this article, the authors present an assessment of what Mexican policymakers and advocates should be aware of regarding permissive gun laws using the example of the United States, the nation with the highest rate of gun ownership in the world and where these policies are already in effect.

AB Euthanasia has become the subject of ethical and political debate in many countries including Mexico. Since many physicians are deeply concerned about euthanasia, due to their crucial participation in its decision and implementation, it is important to know the psychological meaning that the term 'euthanasia' has for them, as well as their attitudes toward this practice. This study explores psychological meaning and attitudes toward euthanasia in 546 Mexican subjects, either medical students or physicians, who were divided into three groups: a) beginning students, b) advanced students, and c) physicians. We used the semantic networks technique, which analyzed the words the participants associated with the term 'euthanasia'. Positive psychological meaning, as well as positive attitudes, prevailed among advanced students and physicians when defining euthanasia, whereas both positive and negative psychological meaning together with more ambivalent attitudes toward euthanasia predominated in beginning students. The findings are discussed in the context of a current debate on a bill proposing active euthanasia in Mexico City.

AB Objective. To assess the association between body mass index (BMI) and the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among Mexico City adolescents. Material and Methods. Household survey of 3 005 adolescents aged 12 to 17 residing in Mexico City in 2005 (response rate = 71%). Face to face interviews were carried out in the homes of participants with informed consent from a parent and/or legal guardian and the assent of the adolescent was obtained. Logistic regression analyses were performed. Results. We only found an association between extremely low BMI and impulse control disorders. Elevated BMI was associated with impulse control disorders only among females. Specific impulse control disorders associated with low BMI included intermittent explosive disorder and conduct disorder. Only intermittent explosive disorder was associated with elevated BMI. Conclusion. Among Mexican adolescents, those with extremely high or extremely low BM I were more likely to have impulse control disorders than were adolescents with normal BMI.

AB Suicide is a phenomenon that occurs worldwide, affecting people of almost all ages, where more and more adolescents are affected, impacting at the same time their family, friends, and even the society that surrounds them. Therefore, the general objective of the study is to identify the main risk factors associated with suicidal behavior in young people aged 13 to 18 years in the community of Guaymas, Sonora, Mexico. A mixed study was conducted, a battery of psychological tests was used on 120 secondary and high school students, as well as interviews to corroborate the results. For the data analysis, the statistical program SPSS version 21.0 and a discourse analysis were used. The results show a Cronbach's Alpha .83 indicating a high index of reliability, mean, median, mode, standard deviation and correlations were obtained. The results indicate that the psychosocial factors that are occurring in the study population are dysfunctional families, causing depression and low self-esteem. The model explains 41% suicidal behavior. It is proposed to design strategies of socio-educational inclusion for the application in schools, this being a great influence in the training of young people.

AB Objective. To document the under-registration of violent deaths related to pregnancy and the importance of considering these violent deaths within the definition of maternal mortality.
   Material and Methods. The study was carried out in the state of Morelos, based on the review of all death certificates (394) of reproductive aged women (12-49 years) who died during 2001. Based on a list of diagnostic criteria we eliminated 167 certificates that were neither violent deaths nor maternal deaths. The remaining 227 certificates were further evaluated through verbal autopsy and/or review of medical charts.
   Results. Fifty-one violent deaths were found. Eighteen maternal deaths were officially reported in 200 1, however, our study identified 23 direct maternal deaths and four violent deaths during pregnancy and the post-partum period. We found that this reproductive event was the direct trigger for the homicide or suicide of these four women, and only one of these cases was documented officially.
   Conclusions. Violent deaths related to pregnancy should be included in official maternal mortality statistics as indirect causes of maternal deaths. This would allow for a greater and more accurate understanding of violent maternal deaths and guide appropriate prevention and care policies, programs and services. Verbal autopsy is a useful technique for identifying cases of violent maternal deaths.

AB Introduction: The United States-Mexico border is perceived as dangerous by the media and current political leaders. Hispanic ethnicity, low socioeconomic status, male gender and adolescent age have previously been identified as risk factors for penetrating trauma (PT).
   Methods: A retrospective review of PT was performed in a border region. Children 0-17 years old, admitted to the region's only level I trauma center between 2001 and 2016 were included. Standardized morbidity ratio was used to compare observed to expected morbidity.
   Results: There were 417 PT admissions. 197 (47%) were non-accidental, 34 (8%) suicide attempts and 186 (45%) accidental. There were 12 homicides, 7 suicides and no accidental deaths. The region contains over 280,000 children, thus yielding a homicide rate of 0.26 per 100,000. The U.S. pediatric homicide rate was 2.6-4.0 over this period. Adolescents 13-17 years old accounted for 237 (57%) admissions, 152 (78%) of non-accidental admissions and 12 (63%) deaths. Most admissions (N = 321, 77%) and 15 of the deaths (79%) were males. Non-accidental injuries were more frequent in ZIP codes associated with low incomes. Hispanic patients accounted for 173 (88%) of non-accidental trauma. However, 40 (20%) non-accidental injuries occurred in Mexico and 157 (80%) injuries occurred in an 82% Hispanic region. Therefore, the standardized morbidity ratio for Hispanic ethnicity was 1.048 (CL 0.8-1.2, P = 0.6).
   Conclusion: On the United States-Mexico border, the pediatric homicide rate was less than 1/10 the national average. Male adolescents are at risk for non-accidental PT. In a Hispanic majority population, Hispanic ethnicity was not a risk factor for PT. It is possible that economic disparity, rather than race/ethnicity, is a risk factor for PT. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Incarcerated American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) women have multiple physical, social, and emotional concerns, many of which may stem from adverse childhood experiences (ACE). We interviewed 36 AI/AN women incarcerated in the New Mexico prison system to determine the relationship between ACE and adult outcomes. ACE assessment included physical neglect, dysfunctional family (e.g., household members who abused substances, were mentally ill or suicidal, or who were incarcerated), violence witnessed in the home, physical abuse, and sexual abuse. The most prevalent ACE was dysfunctional family (75%), followed by witnessing violence (72%), sexual abuse (53016), physical abuse (42%), and physical neglect (22%). ACE scores were positively associated with arrests for violent offenses, lifetime suicide attempt(s), and intimate partner violence.

AB Exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O-3) above USEPA standards are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. Metropolitan Mexico City (MMC) residents have life time exposures to PM2.5 and O-3 above USEPA standards. We investigated AD intra and extracellular protein aggregates and ultrastructural neurovascular pathology in 203 MMC residents age 25.36 +/- 9.23 y. Immunohistochemical methods were used to identify AT8 hyperphosphorilated tau (Htau) and 4G8 (amyloid beta 17-24). Primary outcomes: staging of Htau and amyloid, per decade and cumulative PM2.5 (CPM2.5) above standard. Apolipoprotein E allele 4 (APOE4), age and cause of death were secondary outcomes.
   Subcortical pretangle stage b was identified in an 11month old baby. Cortical tau pre-tangles, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) Stages I-II, amyloid phases 1-2, Htau in substantia nigrae, auditory, oculomotor, trigeminal and autonomic systems were identified by the 2nd decade. Progression to NFT stages III-V was present in 24.8% of 30-40 y old subjects. APOE4 carriers have 4.92 times higher suicide odds (p = 0.0006), and 23.6 times higher odds of NFT V (p < 0.0001) v APOE4 non-carriers having similar CPM2.5 exposure and age. Age (p = 0.0062) and CPM2.5 (p = 0.0178) were significant for developing NFT V. Combustion-derived nanoparticles were associated with early and progressive damage to the neurovascular unit. Alzheimer's disease starting in the brainstem of young children and affecting 99.5% of young urbanites is a serious health crisis. Air pollution control should be prioritised. Childhood relentless Htau makes a fundamental target for neuroprotective interventions and the first two decades are critical. We recommend the concept of preclinical AD be revised and emphasize the need to define paediatric environmental, nutritional, metabolic and genetic risk factor interactions of paramount importance to prevent AD. AD evolving from childhood is threating the wellbeing of our children and future generations.

AB Objective. To assess the internal consistency, as well as the construct, concurrent and external consistency of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-R) in Mexican adolescents. Material and Methods. The data are from two samples of middle-school students from Mexico City. The questionnaire included the CES-D-R and other scales for suicide problems, peer and family violence, and drug use. Results. The sample included 1 549 students (mean age 14 years, SD=1.2). The CES-D-R showed a six-factor structure (explained variance, 55%) with an excellent internal consistency (alpha=0.93), a significant discriminative power for opposite scores (z=-3.695, p<0.001), and a positive significant correlation with the Roberts Suicidal Ideation Scale (r=0.685, p<0.001). Conclusions. The CES-D-R has excellent psychometric characteristics for Mexican adolescents and therefore is deemed as an adequate tool for the assessment of depressive symptoms in large samples to detect mental health needs and design preventive interventions.

ID LIFE EVENTS
AB The measurement of stress and anxiety produced by recent life events is crucial to the assessment of suicidal risk in adolescents. The Life Events for Adolescents questionnaire, incorporating stress coping styles, is a proven instrument for detecting and assessing the impact of adverse events among adolescents. The Inventory of Suicidal Risk for Adolescents (IRIS) is a screening test aimed at detecting risk for suicidal behavior. The sample for the present study included 341 Mexican adolescents from Mexico City, with ages ranging from 13 to 18 years old ((X) over bar= 14.5; SD= 1.6). Correlations between these instruments showed that risk profiles are highly related, especially between personal and social adjustment, and interpersonal relationships. We conclude that a broader and more detailed evaluation of young students at risk of emotional distress and suicide is possible by using these two instruments together as part of a school-based screening strategy.

AB Research on depression among Latinx populations is increasing; however, a focus on what triggers depression among this community is lacking. This study aims to identify perceived triggers for depression through a secondary analysis of 28 adolescent girls who self-identified as Latinx (mean age = 17.07 years, SD = 0.77). Sixty-one percent of the girls reported being first generation (born in Mexico), having lived in Mexico an average of 8.95 years and the primary language at home being Spanish (63%). Of these, the associated triggers of 20 major depression episodes (MDE) and eight minor depressive episodes (i.e., two to four MDE criteria endorsed) were examined. Seventy-five triggers were identified with a majority reflecting family/parent relationships, romance/friendship issues, and self and others' expectations/pressures. These findings suggest that certain life events and stressors precede depressive symptoms among Latinx adolescent girls.

TI Suicidal phenomenon in adolescents and school context: link between
   self-management and health services
SO SALUD MENTAL
LA Spanish
DT Article
DE suicide; adolescents; self-management; schools
AB Deliberately Self-Inflicted Injuries (DSII) con include different behaviors with lethal consequences. Suicide threat, suicide attempt and suicide itself can be grouped within these conducts.
   Though suicide in school contexts is more frequent in women, it has been observed that DSII has similar frequencies in both genders according to age, recurrence, motives, methods, and lethality.
   Official sources provide on epidemiological overview of the suicide phenomenon and concur in pointing out that: a) adolescent and young population has the highest suicide attempt and suicide prevalences; b) men commit more suicide than women but these attempt it more than men; and c) there are some areas in Mexico where suicide prevalences are higher.
   There is a lot of information about the suicide problem, but there are still some questions unanswered. For example, what are the most subtle characteristics of the different adolescent and young populations affected by the phenomenon? Do the context and the type of population represent a specific peculiarity? How does suicide behave in juvenile offenders? How does it behove in people who live and work in the streets? And how does it behave in groups of migrant and indigenous people?
   From the present situation of the suicide phenomenon in the school context, emerges the importance of intervention strategies for preventing its occurrence. Thus, one of the proposals under development underlines the need for creating self-management and binding mechanisms within schools.
   Self-management implies an ascending transformation process, which seeks that the individuals of certain group or community identify their own needs and change their perception of such needs to ignite the development of the inherent potentials in their community.
   The suicidal problem is growing in school population, that is why it is important to treat it adequately from prevention, having in mind the characteristics of socio-educational institutions. These institutions have particular resources and needs that shape them and could make them ideal setting for prevention and mental health promotion among adolescents.
   Since the suicide phenomenon has a multifactorial nature, complex and dynamic, an interdisciplinary approach seems to be one the most adequate options to work. This assumption represents a starting point to promote self-management actions that facilitate links between schools and mental health services.
   Nevertheless, within educational institutions coexist a series of complex circumstances that, at the same time, found and affect the possibility to begin self-management. For example, the academic and bureaucratic demands have an impact on keeping the links with health services or diminish the role of the school as a potential facilitator.
   Another element opposing the development of self-management strategies in schools is the context where facilities are located. Many schools are in areas where drug traffic is usual, where weapon trading is evident, and where informal commerce and insecurity are normal.
   Thus, if self-management process is to be initiated, the proposal should be founded on a well-defined basis, which should address these elements:
   1. A clear definition of the situations to be attended.
   2. Specific strategies to achieve goals, to create interest, and to motivate the school staff.
   3. To acknowledge real chances to fulfill perceived needs and the possible obstacles.
   4. To consider all the people involved in achieving objectives, their roles, and the commitments they would attend.
   5. To work constantly and consistently to ignite self-management.
   6. To make use of every convenient option available.
   7. To conduct meetings to establish specific needs, to remark objectives, to communicate achievements, and to structure or re-structure plans.

ID INEQUALITIES
AB Objectives: One overarching goal of Healthy People 2010 is to eliminate health disparities. Reducing disparities improves the overall health status of a population but is a lengthy process. The disparity change score (DCS) is a method for tracking health disparities over time. Methods: Rates, rate ratios, and DCSs were calculated to track disparities during two time periods by sex, race/ethnicity, education, and income for key health indicators. Time periods were 10 years apart for all death indicators; length between time periods varied for other indicators depending on data collection systems. Results: Sexrace/ethnicity-, education-, and income-based disparities and disparity changes for New Mexico were identified. In general, males, American Indians, and those with the lowest income and education experienced the greatest health disparities. Five disparities that are worsening were identified for targeted interventions, mainly for males (firearm-related death and suicide) and American Indians (diabetes death and influenza/pneumonia death), but also for white non-Hispanics (drug-related death). Conclusions: Examining disparities at one point in time discounts disparity change over time. The DCS can help identify large disparities that are worsening and toward which resources for targeted interventions can be redirected. New Mexico should consider interventions for the five key disparities identified in this study.

AB Objective. Limited educational and job opportunities for youth has led to a phenomenon termed NEET (not in education, employment or training). The objective is to estimate the prevalence of psychiatric disorders, substance use and suicidal behavior in youth classified as NEET and to compare with those who study only, work only or do both. Material and Methods. 3 005 12-to-17 year-olds in Mexico City were evaluated in 2005 with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses considered the multistage weighted sample design. Results. NEET youth as well as those who work only or study and work simultaneously have greater odds of psychiatric disorder, substance use and suicidal behavior compared to those who study exclusively even after controlling for social disadvantage. Conclusion. Vulnerability is not circumscribed to NEET adolescents, but to all teens who are not exclusive students. Supporting youth to continue studying exclusively may buffer negative mental health outcomes.

AB There is growing evidence that air pollution is a risk factor for a number of neurodegenerative diseases, most notably Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD). It is generally assumed that the pathology of these diseases arises only later in life and commonly begins within olfactory eloquent pathways prior to the onset of the classical clinical symptoms. The present study demonstrates that chronic exposure to high levels of air pollution results in AD- and PD-related pathology within the olfactory bulbs of children and relatively young adults ages 11 months to 40 years. The olfactory bulbs (OBs) of 179 residents of highly polluted Metropolitan Mexico City (MMC) were evaluated for AD- and alpha-synuclein-related pathology. Even in toddlers, hyperphosphorylated tau (hTau) and Lewy neurites (LN) were identified in the OBs. By the second decade, 84% of the bulbs exhibited hTau (48/57), 68% LNs and vascular amyloid (39/57) and 36% (21/57) diffuse amyloid plaques. OB active endothelial phagocytosis of red blood cell fragments containing combustion-derived nanoparticles (CDNPs) and the neurovascular unit damage were associated with myelinated and unmyelinated axonal damage. OB hTau neurites were associated mostly with pretangle stages la and lb in subjects <= 20 years of age, strongly suggesting olfactory deficits could potentially be an early guide of AD pretangle subcortical and cortical hTau. APOE4 versus APOE3 carriers were 6-13 times more likely to exhibit OB vascular amyloid, neuronal amyloid accumulation, alphasynuclein aggregates, hTau neurofibrillary tangles, and neurites. Remarkably, APOE4 carriers were 4.57 times more likely than non-carriers to die by suicide. The present findings, along with previous data that over a third of clinically healthy MMC teens and young adults exhibit low scores on an odor identification test, support the concept that olfactory testing may aid in identifying young people at high risk for neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, results strongly support early neuroprotective interventions in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and CDNP's exposed individuals <= 20 years of age, and the critical need for air pollution control.

AB BACKGROUND Suicidal ideation, an important risk factor for suicide, is strongly associated with substance use. Factors such as family cohesion, connection with friends, and social support can be protective against suicidal behaviors. The purpose of this study was to explore the association between suicidal ideation, substance use, and resiliency factors among middle school students. METHODS The 2013 New Mexico Youth Risk and Resiliency Survey provided the data for this analysis. Suicidal ideation was defined as affirmative responses to questions about thoughts of killing oneself and/or making a suicide plan. We used logistic regression to explore the association between suicidal ideation, substance use, and resiliency factors. RESULTS Overall, 23% of students reported suicidal ideation. Among girls, having a caring friend was associated with lower odds of suicidal ideation only among those not using other drugs. Among boys, having a caring friend decreased the odds of suicidal ideation regardless of substance use. CONCLUSIONS Suicidal ideation is prevalent among middle school children. Substance abuse is associated with suicidal ideation; however, individual and community support can be protective. Interventions aimed at reducing suicidal behaviors among middle school students should account for the impact of substance use and help strengthen social support.

AB Background. Psychiatrists may be at an increased risk of suicide, since they encounter stressful factors in their everyday activities in addition to the sociodemographic factors for suicidal ideation reported for Mexican population.
   Aim of the study. To determine whether experiences inherent to the profession were related to the self-report of suicidal ideation among Mexican psychiatrists or could be attributed to factors previously reported in the general population (age, marital status, presence of a mental disorder and not having received specialized treatment).
   Methods. This was a cross-sectional retrospective study with 288 psychiatrists from Mexico who participated through an online survey where current working activities, self-reported mental health conditions (major depression, anxiety, burnout and suicidal ideation) and professional adversities (assaults, lawsuits, patients with suicidal ideation or who had committed suicide, perceived discrimination and social support) throughout the professional lifespan were evaluated.
   Results. Twenty-two psychiatrists (7.6%) reported having had suicidal ideation at some point in their training in psychiatry or their professional lives as psychiatrists. Depression and burnout were the most important predictors for suicidal ideation while greater satisfaction with social support was the most important protector, followed by being married/living together and having other physicians in the family.
   Conclusions. Psychiatrist represent a risk population for suicidal ideation. As such, detection and attention are essential. Psychiatrists need to be encouraged to pursue healthy, lasting interpersonal relationships and seek professional help when required. (C) 2019 IMSS. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Mistreatment and child suicide in the State of Guanajuato
SO SALUD MENTAL
LA Spanish
DT Article
DE child suicide; child abuse; psychological autopsy; Guanajuato
ID EMOTIONAL DISORDERS; ADOLESCENTS; MEXICO; ABUSE; MALTREATMENT
AB The understanding of child suicide has achieved more and more specific notions since it started to be studied from the theory of adult suicide. Now, the implication of certain factors such as the evolution of death conceptualization, the desire of joining an absent significant person, the premeditation of the suicidal act, the involvement of family environment as a contributing or protective factor, or a previous mistreatment experience, has become clearly recognized.
   Suicides which occur during the childhood period have been associated to previous sexual-nature abuse experiences. In adult suicides, the presence of some kind of mistreatment during their childhood period has also been found. Both phenomena, mistreatment and child suicide, are usually under-registered because of the variability of their defining approaches or because of some cultural influences such as violence occurring naturally or negation of child suicide or premeditation.
   It is postulated that the mechanics of child mistreatment traps the abuser into a dynamics based on the inequality of physical, intellectual and/or moral conditions; this reality plus the defenseless nature of children, impedes the termination of that situation unless it finishes by means of another violent act such, as a suicide. Furthermore, the consequences suffered by a child victim of mistreatment can become contributing factors for a suicidal behavior consummation. Consequently, dysfunctions or disturbances on cognitive, psychological, identity, belonging or hopelessness state of the victim, as well as the emotional pain caused by the mistreatment may favor a suicide behavior. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the presence of any given type of child mistreatment in children (since eight to 14 years old) that incurred in a suicide in the State of Guanajuato between 1995 and 2001.
   The methodology used for this descriptive, observational, retrospective and transversal study, was ex-post:facto (after the event), since the technique for data gathering was carried out by psychological autopsy. This technique facilitates an access into the families and to the understanding of their dynamics, and also to recognizing the circumstances prior to the decease. This technique included one or several interviews with people close to deceased child, besides a detailed analysis of the suicidal event and of all the deceased child's residual belongings (suicide notes in this case). This study searched some direct and indirect indicators of a possible child mistreatment suffered by suicidal children. The psychological autopsy was conformed by a Questionnaire of Psychosocial data, a Suicidal Act Evaluation Questionnaire and by an Informant's Reliability Scale. Because of the lack of specific backgrounds for the cases of child suicide, the Psychological Questionnaire was specifically developed for this study.
   Studied cases were those belonging to child suicides, up to 14-year-old children, who consummated their death in the State of Guanajuato in the 1995 to 2001 period. The files were obtained by the General Attorney Department. With the information extracted from such files, we proceeded to establish phone and mail contact with relatives of the deceased children. Later on, some interviews were carried out with one or more people close to each child; these interviews were held by psychologists qualified in Psychological Autopsy and Emotional Contention Techniques.
   The examined data came basically from the Psycho-Social Questionnaire and from the Content Analysis of suicide notes. The analysis method for first data, of quantitative nature, was by frequency distribution and correlation, computed by SPSS statistical software. Qualitative data resulting from the analysis of suicide notes content were verified by a technical jury integrated by three participating clinical psychologists.
   Results: Twenty nine suicide cases were analyzed, representing 69% of child suicides up to 14-year-old children in the State of Guanajuato within the aforementioned period. The rest of the files were not included in this research because the impossibility for locating the victim's relatives due to changes of residence, and in a lower percentage because they refused to participate in the study due to the emotional pain of talking about the suicide event, or because they ignored the minor child's data regarding the circumstances and causes of his death.
   Of all the examined cases, 19 (65.5%) were men and 10 (34.5%) were women. The range of child suicides' age was from eight to 14 years old, with a 12.55 year-old average and a 1.62 year-old standard deviation. Five suicide notes were analyzed, which belonged to 4 children: 3 girls (one of them left two notes) and one boy. With respect to 72.4% of the cases, the interviewed persons were first-degree relatives and regarding the remaining percentage, they were cousins, uncles or grandparents who reported having had a close relationship with the deceased child. The average age of the interviewees was 43 years, with a standard deviation age of 17.19 years.
   In almost half of the suicides (51.7%) some kind of violence was suffered. According to the interviewees' statements, 31 % of the children who committed suicide had suffered some kind of psychological mistreatment, 41.1% of them had received some of kind of physical mistreatment, 3.4% were victims of sexual abuse and 10.34% were neglected. Almost a quarter of all the children had suffered two or three kinds of mistreatment. Additionally, 41.4% of suicidal children had seen physical violence at home. Four of the suicide notes included explicit declarations of mistreatment experiences.
   Other variables that were found were the presence of previous suicide attempts in 20.7% of the cases; and a 26.3% of cases where a relative also had a previous suicide attempt. Family alcohol consumption was detected in 65.5% and drug consumption in 24% of the cases. Further analysis show a correlation between child previous suicide attempts and psychological mistreatment (p= 0.004) or any other kind of violence exposure (p= 0.015).
   It is concluded that an important percentage of children who incurred in a suicide were indeed victims of some kind of child mistreatment, of which physical one was particularly evident. However, neither physical not sexual abuse can be separated from their implicit component: the emotional mistreatment. Studies of pure qualitative nature could contribute with more information about the dynamics that associates both phenomena. It is deemed that child mistreatment prevention would directly impact both suicide occurrence for the same group of age, and probably also within adult populations thus reducing its prevalence.

AB Current methodologies employed in collecting data for suicide research present several limitations. In this article, we describe a novel method and tool to prospectively study suicidal behavior and its related risk and protective factors in different countries. This tool is a web-based database, which will initially be developed and piloted by suicide research groups from Austria, Brazil, Chile, France, Italy, Mexico, Spain, Sweden, and the US. The database will develop and integrate research tools key to collaboration, permit exploration of ethical considerations, and provide a universal interface in English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, and German that will make it possible to incorporate new groups from different countries to the network. The common database resulting of this cross-national effort will allow researchers to share and compare data across countries in a large sample of patients. Using anonymous electronic records of patients, we will: 1) determine the impact of risk and protective factors (viz. aggression and religious affiliation) in different socio-cultural environments; 2) develop a clinical model of suicidal behavior that integrates the multiple dimensions implicated; 3) try differentiating the effects of biological, environmental, and cultural factors on suicidal behavior, and 4) offer the global psychiatric research community a tool that will standardize assessment across nations, allowing for better generalization.

AB This study aims to determine the degree of acetylcholinesterase inhibition and neurological symptoms for each of the psychiatric disorders diagnosed in the farm workers of a rural population in the state of Baja California, Mexico. We conducted a cross-sectional study on 140 agricultural workers (exposed participants). The study was run using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Diagnostic Test (MINI), a pre-established questionnaire to diagnose the mental state of each agricultural worker. Analysis of enzymatic activity was carried out using the modified Ellman method. The results showed that, among agricultural workers with slightly inhibited enzymatic activity, 25% met the criteria for the diagnosis of major depression with suicidal attitudes, 23.9% with inhibited enzymatic activity showed generalized anxiety, 23.5% showed combined depression-anxiety, and 22% met the criteria for major depression and no psychiatric diagnosis disorder. These results suggest the need for the development of effective public-health strategies to inform farm workers about integrated pesticide management in order to prevent serious health complications.

AB Background: Various rates of alcoholism, drug abuse, mental illness, and suicide among physician have been reported, generally higher than those in the general population. Psychiatry residents, as other specializing physicians, seem to be prone to suffering them. The prevalence of psychological symptoms among psychiatry residents has not been formally studied.
   Method: The authors studied the presence, frequency, and severity of psychological symptoms among psychiatry residents from a public psychiatric hospital in Mexico City, Mexico. The SLC-90 was answered by 92 residents; data were analyzed by SAS software, and gender differences were established. Results were compared with data from a previous study realized in the general Mexican population.
   Results: Interpersonal sensitivity, depression, obsessive-compulsive, and somatic worries were seen more frequently or more severely than other categories. Female residents reported symptoms more frequently.
   Conclusion: A significant portion of psychiatry residents reported psychological symptoms, although they described them as less frequent and less severe than found in the general Mexican population. In spite of this, interpersonal sensitivity was shown as the most severe symptomatic dimension in our sample, unlike findings in the general population.

ID TRAUMA
AB Objective. To compare demographics and motivations for falls from bridges at the United States-Mexico border and in El Paso County, Texas, and to analyze injuries and injury patterns to support intentionality and to provide treatment recommendations.
   Methods. A retrospective observational review was conducted of hospital admissions to a trauma center after falls from bridges from 1995 to 2009. Statistical methods used were chi-square testing, T-test for means comparison, univariate correlations, and regression analysis.
   Results. Of the 97 evaluated patients, 81.4% fell from U.S.-Mexico border bridges, including one patient who fell from a railway bridge; 74.7% of those falling from border bridges had a non-U.S. address, contrasting with 22.2% of those who fell within the United States. Falls over the border were associated with more immigration-related motivations and fewer suicide attempts. Injuries included lower extremities in 76 (78.4%) and thoracolumbar spine in 27 (27.8%) patients; 16 patients with a thoracolumbar spine fracture (59.3%) also had a lower extremity injury. Mean hospital length of stay was 7.2 days. Mean injury severity score was 8.45 (range 1-43). Age, injury severity score, and pelvic fracture increased the hospital length of stay.
   Conclusions. Patients fell while emigrating-immigrating based on residence and motivating factors. A dyad of lower extremity and thoracolumbar spine injuries coincided in 59.3% of those with a thoracolumbar spine injury; thoracolumbar spine imaging of patients evaluated after falls from bridges is recommended. Proposed prevention strategies include posting signs on bridges and installing catch-net safety barriers.

AB The Texas-Mexico border incidence rate of tuberculosis (TB) is 10 times the rate of TB in the United States. Additionally, this area is plagued by antibiotic-resistant TB at a rate that is 70% higher among those living along the border than among nonborder residents. Both the high rate of TB and the emergence of drug-resistant TB increases the importance of controlling TB along the U.S.-Mexico border. Men have higher rates of TB than women, which can be attributed to biological differences and increased environmental exposure. The purpose of this article is to describe the experience of TB for Mexican American men living on the Texas-Mexico border. This a qualitative descriptive study, using participants from a larger study. A purposeful sample was recruited through two south Texas TB clinics. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and translated into English. Data analysis consisted of line-by-line coding, labeling, organizing, and discovering common codes to describe participants' experience of TB and TB treatment. The participants include 13 Mexican American men. Ages ranged from 22 to 76 years. Only one participant was employed during treatment. Years of education ranged from no school to an associate's degree. Five themes were discovered: misinformation, delayed diagnosis, stigma, depression, and loss of community. Participants without social support were further isolated and felt a greater burden of treatment. Two participants contemplated suicide and two others told their families to leave them because they were a burden and infectious. The burden of treatment on the patient is great, especially for Hispanic men.

   CHILDHOOD; IDEATION; MEXICO
AB Objective. To compare the prevalence of bullying victimization, suicidal ideation, suicidal attempts, and negative health behaviors (current tobacco use, recent heavy alcohol use, truancy, involvement in physical fighting, and unprotected sexual intercourse) in five different Latin American countries and determine the association of bullying victimization with these outcomes, exploring both bullying type and frequency.
   Methods. Study data were from Global School-based Student Health Surveys from Bolivia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Peru, and Uruguay, which covered nationally representative samples of school-going adolescents. The surveys used a two-stage clustered sample design, sampling schools and then classrooms. Logistic regression models were run to determine the statistical significance of associations with bullying.
   Results. Among the 14 560 school-going adolescents included in this study, the prevalence of any bullying victimization in the past 30 days was 37.8%. Bullying victimization was associated with greater odds of suicidal ideation with planning (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 3.12; P < 0.0001) and at least one suicide attempt (AOR: 3.07; P < 0.0001). An increasing exposure-response effect of increasing days of bullying victimization on suicide outcomes was also observed. Bullying victimization was associated with higher odds of current tobacco use (AOR: 2.14; P < 0.0001); truancy (AOR: 1.76; P < 0.0001); physical fighting (AOR: 2.40; P < 0.0001); and unprotected sexual intercourse (AOR: 1.77; P < 0.0001).
   Conclusions. Although the prevalence of bullying victimization varied by country, its association with suicidal ideation and behavior and negative health behaviors remained relatively consistent. Addressing bullying needs to be made a priority in Latin America, and an integrated approach that also includes mental and physical health promotion is needed.

AB Objective. To estimate psychopathology and self-harm behavior of incoming first-year college students, socio-demographic correlates, service use and willingness to seek treatment. Materials and methods. 4 189 male and female incoming first-year students of six universities in four different states of Mexico responded to an online survey with a 79.3% response rate. Results. Almost one in three incoming students has experienced some type of psychopathology; however, only one in five has received treatment. Female, students who are older, whose parents are not married or deceased, and who have a non-heterosexual orientation, no religion or a non-Catholic./Christian religion have greater odds (1.18 - 1.99), whereas those who attend a private university and have a parent with some college education have lower odds (0.68 - 0.75) of experiencing any probable disorder. Conclusions. Substantial unmet need for mental health services combined with reported willingness to use university services suggests an opportunity for the detection, referral, and treatment of incoming students to promote a successful transition.

AB The important functions of dopamine (DA) in emotional behavior, control of voluntary movements, memory, and attention have been recognized. To date, the 939 C/T (rs6275) polymorphism of this gene has been implicated in association with alcohol and drug abuse and also with schizophrenia. We examined the allele frequencies of 939CT (rs6275) polymorphism of the DRD2 gene and those of the respective genotypes in a Mexican population (n = 166) with mental deviations and a history of suicide attempts and psychiatric diagnoses (101 suicidal individuals from Mexico City and 65 patients recruited from psychiatry outpatients of Tabasco, Mexico). The most common allele found in both subpopulations was the T allele (about 60% and 69%, respectively). In addition to the Mexican population, the frequencies were compared with those in some Asian and American populations. Thus, a noticeable difference of the distribution of the 939 C/T (rs6275) was observed in patients with the above-mentioned mental deviations, as well as in the Asian population with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Future studies are necessary to evaluate mentally unhealthy populations to observe the role of the above polymorphism in the susceptibility to psychiatric diseases.

AB Purpose: Gender minority (GM) youth experience high rates of violence, and research on protective factors to reduce violence victimization and self-harm is lacking. The purpose of this study was to determine how family, school, peer, and community support influenced rates of violence victimization and self-harm among GM and cisgender adolescents.
   Methods: This research uses data from the 2017 New Mexico Youth Risk and Resiliency Survey (N = 18,451). The main independent variable was gender, dichotomized into GM and cisgender, and the secondary independent variables were family, school, community, and peer support. Dependent variables were sexual and dating violence, suicide attempts, and nonsuicidal self-injury. Logistic regression models were built for the four dependent variables, including demographics, support scores, and interaction terms between gender and support.
   Results: Six percent of high school students in New Mexico identified as GM are unsure of their gender. GM students experienced higher rates of violence and self-harm and lower levels of support than cisgender students. Among all students, family support was associated with lower odds of sexual violence and self-harm, while school support was associated with lower odds of dating violence and nonsuicidal self-injury. There were significant interactions between gender, violence, and support. The protective effects of support were less pronounced for GM students than for cisgender students.
   Conclusions: Family and school support are associated with lower rates of some forms of violence and self-harm among adolescents. Additional support may be necessary to reduce harm among GM adolescents, who are at higher risk for violence and its sequelae. (C) 2019 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

AB The aim of this research was to study relational violence between peers from a psychosocial perspective, by analyzing family variables (family functioning and communication), social variables (social reputation -both perceived and ideal- and attitude towards institutional authority), and individual variables (psychological distress and suicide ideation) in adolescent students. The sample consisted of 8,115 adolescents aged 11 to 16 years from the State of Nuevo Leon, Mexico. We performed a forward stepwise multiple regression analysis, the results of which showed that the most important factor in the prediction of violent relational behavior at school is the nonconformist self-perception, followed by psychological distress. Finally, these results and their implications are discussed.

AB Background: Euthanasia requests have increased as the number of debilitated patients rises in both developed and developing countries such as India due to medical, psychosocial-emotional, socioenvironmental, and existential issues amid fears of potential misuse. World's position: Albania, Colombia, the Netherlands, and Switzerland permit euthanasia conditionally. Australia's legalization of euthanasia has been withdrawn. The United States permits withdrawal of life support. Mexico and Norway permit active euthanasia. India's position: Following the Aruna Shanbaug case the Supreme Court granted legal sanction to passive, but not active, euthanasia that is valid till the Parliament legislates on euthanasia. Handling euthanasia requests: Acknowledging the complexity of the problem; individualizing the palliative approach; and accepting the There is no alternative' or There is no answer' (TINA) factor.

The author looks into numerous themes including the impact of broken identities, different ways of understanding the "victim identity", the identities of trauma, the role of transitions, as well as identity dilemmas. By examining the experience of young Mapuche in South America, the experience of war and political violence in Mexico and el Salvador, the identity of displaced young people in Colombia, and a multilevel analysis of child suicides among the Embera ethnic group in Choco, Colombia, a psychosocial and communitarian analysis of the impact of violence and war on youth is offered.

AB In this article, we call into question recent public health claims that loneliness is a problem of epidemic proportions. Current research on this topic is hindered by an overreliance on limited survey data and by paradigmatic imbalance that delineates the study of loneliness to psychological, cognitive, neuroendocrinological and immunological effects, social functioning, physical health, mortality, and gene effects. The article emphasizes that scientific approaches to the phenomena of loneliness are more appropriately conceived and investigated as inherently matters for social, relational, cultural, and contextual analysis of subjective experience. Studies of loneliness and possible relationships to mental health status require investigations of social, environmental, and institutional structures as well as families, peers, friends, counselors, and health providers. This article takes a step in this direction through examining the lived experience of 35 high school students and their families living under conditions of social adversity in Tijuana, B.C., Mexico, with attention to anxiety and depression. Utilizing ethnographic interviews, observations, and psychological screening tools, we provide an overview for the group and illustrate the interrelations of subjective experience and social environment through a case study. These data reveal the vital role of understandings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety from the perspectives of adolescents themselves. We conclude that future studies of loneliness are best informed by in-depth data on subjective experience in relation to social features to advance understandings within the field of global mental health and allied fields.

AB BACKGROUNDAs members of interdisciplinary teams, school nurses provide behavioral health services. Studies indicate that school nurses may lack sufficient continuing education in adolescent behavioral health and in the management of behavioral health emergencies, specifically. We conducted this study to describe the adolescent behavioral health emergencies managed by school nurses.
   METHODSWe used data from a New Mexico public school nurse workforce survey to describe the involvement of school nurses in managing adolescent behavioral health emergencies. We included all respondents who self-identified as working in a secondary school (N=186). We conducted descriptive analyses.
   RESULTSTwo thirds of survey respondents had provided emergency management in the prior school year for child abuse or neglect, depression, and violence at school. Over 40% had provided emergency management for a suicidal student in the prior school year. Although almost 80% of respondents identified violence at school as a very important continuing education topic, 40% reported having received continuing education on this topic in the prior 5years.
   CONCLUSIONSIn New Mexico, public school nurses provide substantial amounts of emergency management for adolescent behavioral health problems. Continuing education received by school nurses on behavioral health emergencies may not be commensurate with their clinical responsibilities.

AB Objective. To estimate the frequency of different forms of sexual violence and its association with mental health problems, such as depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation and attempt and alcohol and drug use. Material and methods. From February to March 1998, a cross-sectional study was conducted among 345 women attending a healthcare center in Mexico City. All women were living with a partner/spouse at the time of the study. The proportions of three different types of sex life were obtained and compared with the chi-squared test. Results. Nineteen per cent of women reported that they had been sexually fondled against their will at least once in their lifetime, 11% had been raped, and 5% had been forced to touch the sex organs of another person against their will. One in every five women reported that they had experienced sexual violence in the context of an intimate relationship. An association was found between some forms of sexual violence and depression, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and use of psychoactive drugs. Conclusions. Sexual violence is a severe public health problem that requires implementing specific programs to sensitize and train healthcare providers to prevent it.

AB Determine the structure of depressive symptoms among adolescents and older adults through the person-centered approach of latent class analysis (LCA).
   The study is based on data from two independent samples collected in Mexico City (2,444 adolescents and 2,223 older adults) which included the revised version of the CES-D. The presence or absence of depressed mood (dysphoria), diminished pleasure (anhedonia), drastic change in weight, sleep problems, thinking and concentration difficulties, excessive or inappropriate guilt, fatigue, psychomotor agitation/retardation, and suicide ideation were used in LCA to determine the structure of depressive symptoms for adolescents and older adults.
   Adolescents reported higher excessive or inappropriate guilt compared to older adults, while older adults had higher proportions of anhedonia, sleep problems, fatigue, and psychomotor agitation/retardation. Similar proportions were found in other symptoms. The LCA analysis showed the best fit with four latent classes (LC): LC 1, "symptoms suggestive of major depressive episode (MDE)" with prevalence of 5.9 % (n = 144) and 10.3 % (n = 230) among adolescents and older adults, respectively; LC 2, "probable MDE symptoms" 18.2 % (n = 446) and 23.0 % (n = 512); LC 3, "possible MDE" 27.7 % (n = 676) and 21.8 % (n = 485); LC 4, "without significant depressive symptoms" 48.2 % (n = 1,178) and 44.8 % (n = 996). The differences in item thresholds between the two groups (adolescents vs. older adults) were statistically significant (Wald test = 255.684, df = 1, p < 0.001).
   This study documented important similarities and differences in the structure of depressive symptoms between adolescents and older adults that merit acknowledgment, further study, and consideration of their potential clinical and public health implications.

AB Purpose: Little is known about the professional and educational challenges experienced by rural school nurses. We conducted this study to describe disparities between the urban and rural professional school nurse workforce in New Mexico and to identify how best to meet the continuing education needs of New Mexico's rural school nurse workforce.
   Methods: We analyzed state data from a 2009 New Mexico Department of Health school nurse workforce survey (71.7% response rate). We included all survey respondents who indicated working as a school nurse in a public school setting in any grade K-12 and who identified their county of employment (N = 311).
   Findings: Rural school nurses were twice as likely as metropolitan nurses to provide clinical services to multiple school campuses (67.3% compared to 30.1%, P < .0001). They were less likely to hold a nursing degree at the baccalaureate level or higher (62.7% compared to 82.3%, P = .0002). Rural school nurses were less likely than metropolitan nurses to have received recent continuing education on anaphylaxis (P < .0001), asthma (P = .027), body mass index (BMI)/healthy weight (P = .0002), diabetes (P < .0001), lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) health (P = .0004), and suicide risk identification and prevention (P = .015). Online courses and telehealth were identified by rural school nurses as among the preferred means for receiving continuing education.
   Conclusions: Our findings support the provision of online courses and telehealth content to address urban-rural disparities in school nursing education and support rural school health.

DE Suicide attempt; suicidal ideation; motives; pregnancy; risk factors
ID POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION; RISK; PREVALENCE; SYMPTOMS; OUTCOMES
AB The aim is to explore the occurrence of suicide ideation and behavior in pregnant women receiving prenatal care and to analyze the motives behind these behaviors.
   Although there are very few studies evaluating the prevalence of the suicide phenomenon (suicide, intentional injuries with or without the aim of taking one's own life, ideas of harming oneself or death) during the prenatal period, it has been reported that pregnancy complications due to suicide attempts occur in 0.4 out of every 1 000 patients discharged from hospitals in the state of California in the United States and in one out of every 283 pregnant women in specialized mental health services. Suicide ideation occurs in 1.4% of English expectant mothers, 0.5% of Finnish ones and 27.8% of US pregnant women with psychiatric disorders. In Latin America, it is estimated to occur in 16.7% of pregnant teenagers.
   Although suicide ideation and suicide attempts during pregnancy ore less frequent than at other times in life, they have major consequences, increasing the risk of death and affecting fetal development and pregnancy itself.
   Method
   Participants: The interviewees comprised 120 pregnant women who come in for prenatal care at 1. a state Health Center providing primary health care and 2. three Health Homes that provide basic medical services, run by the Health Secretariat in Mexico City. Three of the 120 questionnaires were rejected due to incomplete information, which left a total of 117. Sample characteristics include: mean age, 23.2 years (DS=5); mean monthly income, $3,876 (SD = $239); schooling, 69% had completed junior high school while 31% had completed senior high school; 71% were housewives while 29% were also engaged in paid employment. Marital status: 18% married, 19% single and 63% cohabiting.
   Instrument:A structured questionnaire with the following areas: 1. Socio-demographic information (age, schooling, etc.). 2. Indicators of suicidal ideation and behavior: a) Have you thought a lot about death, whether your own, someone else's or death in general? b) Have you wished to die? c) Hove you ever been about to take your own life? and d) Hove you ever intentionally hurt, cut, poisoned or harmed yourself in order to take your own life?3. Timing and motives. If the event occurred sometime in their life, the interviewer explored whether the event took place during the current pregnancy as well as the reasons why it happened.
   Procedure: In the waiting room of the Health Center, expectant mothers were told about the purpose of the study and the informed consent form. In the Health Homes, final year medical students did the same and arranged appointments for the interviews. The some researcher conducted the interviews in the two settings.
   Results
   Suicidal ideation: Thinking a lot about death at some time in their lives was reported by 29 subjects (24.8%) and during pregnancy by 44 (37.6%). The reasons for these thoughts during this last period are: separation from one's partner, death of a child, fear of childbirth, fear of accidents or sickness and interest in the subject of death. Realizing one is pregnant, feeling lonely, the death or illness of someone close and family problems are among the reasons for thoughts about death as well as the desire to die.
   Desire to die: This was expressed by 29 subjects (24.8%) in the post and by nine (7.7%) during pregnancy. Among the latter group, the reasons were: realizing one is pregnant, the death or illness of someone close and family problems. They also mentioned problems with their partners and parents.
   Suicidal intention: Thirteen said that they had been about to take their own lives at some stage (11.1%), while three (2.6% said that they had done so during pregnancy. During this period, this had been caused by problems with their partners.
   Suicide attempts: Ten women mentioned suicide attempts (8.5%) at sometime in their lives, while one (0.9%) did so during pregnancy. This particular case mentioned problems with her partner as being the cause.
   Discussion
   Thinking a lot about death is the most common indicator. It may be explained by disadvantageous social conditions, but also by the particular conditions of pregnancy. In this respect, there are various fears common to expectant mothers who are apprehensive about the well-being of the future baby and anticipate a difficult childbirth.
   As one would expect, suicide attempts are less common than suicide intentions and the desire for and ideas about death. The desire to die, suicide intentions and attempts are less frequent during pregnancy than at other times in a person's life. This may be due to the future mother's feeling of responsibility, or a possible hormonal effect, which act as protective factors. Problems with one's partner are a risk factor for suicide intention and attempts. This is hardly surprising, since marital problems adversely affect women's mental health at different times in their lives, but during pregnancy, they intensify their insecurity at a time of great transition, making them fearful of the future and leading them to wonder about whether getting pregnant was the right thing to do.
   These observations should be treated with caution due to methodological limitations, such as the small sample size and restricted scope of the research.

AB Bisexuals, lesbians, and homosexuals (BLH) face diverse forms of social exclusion because their sexual orientation (SO) is viewed negatively in most societies. Studies performed in industrialized countries have shown that prejudices faced by the BLH population may have a deleterious effect in their mental health because, in comparison with heterosexuals, they present a higher prevalence of consumption of alcohol and other drugs, suicide attempts, suicide ideation and mental disorders. Meyer has pointed out in those studies that comparing BLH and heterosexual morbidity may only allow for the documentation of the existence of negative effects of heterosexism and homophobia on BLH health. Although this means a substantial advance, it does not allow for the exploration of mechanisms through which oppression leads to higher morbidity in the BLH population. It must be added that most of these studies are not guided by a conceptual framework which explains in detail the differences in mental morbidity between heterosexuals and BLH.
   Despite the fact that in Latin America increasingly more academics and politicians are worried by these problems, knowledge about health and disease conditions in BLH is still incipient. In a literature review it was evinced that almost all the researches performed in Latin America have been centered in the HIV/AIDS infection and other sexually transmissible diseases or traumatisms derived from certain sexual practices in homosexual and bisexual males. It was concluded that more studies are necessary about mental health in the BLH population in which bisexual and lesbian women are included, because they have been studied with less frequency than homosexual and bisexual males.
   Considering the above, the objective of this study was to analyze the effects of internalization of oppression on the risk of presenting mental health damages in the BLH population.
   The oppression of BLH is caused by three dominant norms deriving from the gender system: a) Heterosexism, which is the ideological system that denies, derides and stigmatizes any form of behavior, identity, relation or community different from the heterosexual ones. b) The adherence to gender stereotypes, according to which males must be masculine and women must be feminine. Culturally, homosexuality is equaled to the transgression of gender stereotypes (TGS): homosexual males are thought of not always the case. That is why many BLH have suffered diverse forms of violence because in infancy and adolescence they were feminine males or masculine women. c) Androcentrism consists in the subordination or inferiority of feminine before masculine, that is, the features, attitudes and values considered as masculine are evaluated positively and the individuals who have them possess a superior status, while the symbols defined as feminine are scorned. Androcentrism explains why homosexuality is more punished in males than in females.
   BLH, just like heterosexuals, grow up and live in a society structured in terms of the dominant norms of the gender system. This causes that BLH internalize the dominant values of the gender system. To understand how BLH incorporate oppression in their subjectivity, one may recover the concept of habitus which is defined as a system of categories of perception, thought and action. To be able to evaluate the habitus of the oppressed in BLH it is proposed to "deconstruct" it in three concepts: internalized homophobia, perception of the homosexual stigma and hiding. Internalized homophobia occurs when BLH incorporate in their self-esteem the negative meanings, the prejudices and stereotypes accrued to homosexuality and TGS, which causes them to have negative attitude towards their own homosexuality, the homosexuality of others, towards their TGS and that of others. Due to the symbolic link between TGS and homosexuality, it is important to incorporate the negative attitude towards TGS in the definition of internalized homophobia. The perception of the stigma due to homosexuality refers to the expectations of BLH about possible attitudes and reactions that other persons may have due to their SO. By hiding, BLH modify their physical appearance and their behavior with the goal to make invisible their homosexuality or the expressions considered TGS.
   An observational, cross-sectional and analytical study was performed. Between September and November of 2001, a questionnaire was applied to 506 BLH attending various organizations and institutions in Mexico City visited by different "sub-groups" of BLH. A part of the population was contacted through personal networks of the author and a list of e-mail addresses of a socialization group. The questionnaire was completed by the subjects themselves. Through the questionnaire, the three forms of internalized oppression were evaluated (internalized homophobia, perception of stigma and hiding) and five risks to health perception of the health status, suicide ideation, suicide attempts, mental disorders and alcoholism). To study the association of the three forms of internalized oppression with health damages, prevalence ratios were calculated with confidence intervals of 95%.
   A minoritv of the individuals surveyed evaluated their health status as bad and very bad (3%). Almost 40% of the population presented suicide ideation in the last year and 15% answered that at least once in the past year they had attempted suicide; in women the frequency of suicide attempts was higher (21% in women and 12% in men). Almost three out of ten individuals surveyed presented risk of suffering mental disorders, the prevalence being higher in women (33%) than in men (23%). A fifth of the population presented risk of alcoholism. With the AUDIT scale, an alcoholism prevalence of 21% in BL women was obtained; with the same scale in other populations of women in Mexico it has been found that the prevalence of alcoholism oscillates between 3.6% and 7%. It was observed that the frequency of alcoholism in BL women surveyed was up to seven times higher than that reported by other women.
   Almost 40% of BLH surveyed suffered guilt due to their homosexual feelings and behaviors, a fifth had negative attitudes toward TGS and four out often suffered shame because of TGS. Regarding the indicators of the perception of stigma due to homosexuality, more than half of the individuals surveyed referred that their family, schoolmates or co-workers could react negatively towards a gay or a lesbian and a little more than 40% reported they were afraid of people finding out about their SO. In 40% of the interviewed individuals, their heterosexual friends knew their SO, in 31% most of their co-workers or schoolmates were aware of it and in 45% of the cases most of their relatives were aware of it. Half of the surveyed individuals with a partner avoided showing him/her affection and a little more of 40% hid their SO. Half of the surveyed individuals tried to avoid TGS in front of heterosexuals and five of ten did it only when they were amongst their BLH friends. Concerning the differences by sex in the forms of internalized oppression, in bisexual and homosexual males those related to TGS were more frequent (negative attitude towards TGS, a shamed of it, tried to avoid TGS and only TGS when they were with BLH friends), while in bisexual and lesbian women the higher percentages were those related to SO (scale of perception of stigma due to homosexuality, expectation of negative reaction of family towards BLH, afraid people knew their SO and avoid showing affection to their partner). Likewise, among bisexual and homosexual males internalized homophobia was more frequent than in bisexual and lesbian women.
   The perception of the health status was not associated with any indicator of internalized homophobia. BLH presenting high levels in the scale of internalized homophobia suffered guilt due to their SO or had negative attitudes towards TGS, showed higher risk of presenting suicide ideation, suicide attempts and mental disorders. The scale of internalized homophobia and the negative attitude towards TGS were also associated with alcoholism. Shame due to TGS increased their probability of presenting suicide ideation and mental disorders.
   The stigma scale was not related to any of the damages studied. The expectation of negative reactions from their relatives, schoolmates or co-workers was associated with a higher risk of perception of bad or regular health status, suicide ideation and mental disorders.
   As the number of friends who knew the SO increased (hiding indicator), the greater the probability was of presenting mental disorders, but less than that of presenting alcoholism. The increase in the number of schoolmates or co-workers who knew the SO was related with a lower risk of alcoholism. Avoiding showing affection to their partner of the same sex was related with a higher risk or presenting alcoholism. The risks of suicide ideation, suicide attempts and mental disorders were higher in the persons that did all they could to hide their SO. BLH who avoided TGS had a higher probability of presenting suicide ideation, mental disorders and alcoholism.
   The results of the study showed that BLH population have important health problems such as suicide ideation and suicide attempts and alcoholism in the case of the LB women. Further, although there are differences between homosexual and bisexual males and lesbian and bisexual females regarding the most frequent type of internalized oppression, the three forms of internalized oppression (internalized homophobia, perception of the stigma due to homosexuality, and hiding) were associated with a higher risk of presenting suicide ideation, suicide attempts, mental disorders and alcoholism. These findings may be recovered to prevent health damages in the BLH population.
   The actions directed by governments towards the BLH population have been basically HIV/AIDS research and prevention programs in homosexual and bisexual males. These actions are the result of the magnitude of the problem and not because the existence of these sub-groups is recognized. However, this research has evidenced that besides the HIV/AIDS problem, BLH present other health problems such as suicide ideation and suicide attempts, mental disorders and alcoholism. Therefore, it is required that government institutions broaden the scope of the welfare and health programs directed towards the BLH population. Evidently, long term measures must be taken to eliminate prejudice against homosexuality and TGS, which may only be possible through modifications in the social institutions.

AB Problem/Condition: In 2016, approximately 65,000 persons died in the United States as a result of violence-related injuries. This report summarizes data from CDC's National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) regarding violent deaths from 32 U.S. states for 2016. Results are reported by sex, age group, race/ethnicity, type of location where injured, method of injury, circumstances of injury, and other selected characteristics.
   Period Covered: 2016.
   Description of System: NVDRS collects data regarding violent deaths obtained from death certificates, coroner/medical examiner reports, law enforcement reports, and secondary sources (e.g., child fatality review team data, Supplementary Homicide Reports, hospital data, and crime laboratory data). This report includes data collected from 32 states for 2016 (Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin). NVDRS collates information for each death and links deaths that are related (e.g., multiple homicides, homicide followed by suicide, or multiple suicides) into a single incident.
   Results: For 2016, NVDRS captured 40,374 fatal incidents involving 41,466 deaths in the 32 states included in this report. The majority (62.3%) of deaths were suicides, followed by homicides (24.9%), deaths of undetermined intent (10.8%), legal intervention deaths (1.2%) (i.e., deaths caused by law enforcement and other persons with legal authority to use deadly force acting in the line of duty, excluding legal executions), and unintentional firearm deaths (<1.0%). (The term legal intervention is a classification incorporated into the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision [ICD-10] and does not denote the lawfulness or legality of the circumstances surrounding a death caused by law enforcement.) Demographic patterns varied by manner of death. Suicide rates were highest among males, non-Hispanic American Indians/Alaska Natives, non-Hispanic whites, adults aged 45-64 years, and men aged >= 75 years. The most common method of injury was a firearm among males and poisoning among females. Suicides were most often preceded by a mental health, intimate partner, substance abuse, or physical health problem or a recent or impending crisis during the previous or upcoming 2 weeks. Homicide rates were highest among males and persons aged <1 year and 15-44 years. Among males, non-Hispanic blacks accounted for most homicides and had the highest rate of any racial/ethnic group. The most common method of injury was a firearm. Homicides were most often precipitated by an argument or conflict, occurred in conjunction with another crime, or for females, were related to intimate partner violence. When the relationship between a homicide victim and a suspected perpetrator was known, the suspect was most frequently an acquaintance/friend among males and a current or former intimate partner among females. Legal intervention death rates were highest among men aged 20-44 years, and the rate among non-Hispanic black males was three times the rate among non-Hispanic white males. Precipitating circumstances for legal intervention deaths most frequently were an alleged criminal activity in progress, reported use of a weapon by the victim in the incident, a mental health or substance abuse problem (other than alcohol abuse), an argument or conflict, or a recent or impending crisis. Unintentional firearm deaths were more frequent among males, non-Hispanic whites, and persons aged 15-24 years. These deaths most often occurred while the shooter was playing with a firearm and most often were precipitated by a person unintentionally pulling the trigger or mistakenly thinking the firearm was unloaded. Rates of deaths of undetermined intent were highest among males, particularly non-Hispanic black and American Indian/Alaska Native males, and adults aged 25-64 years. Substance abuse, mental health problems, physical health problems, and a recent or impending crisis were the most common circumstances preceding deaths of undetermined intent. In 2016, a total of 3,655 youths aged 10-24 years died by suicide. The majority of these decedents were male, non-Hispanic white, and aged 18-24 years. Most decedents aged 10-17 years died by hanging/strangulation/suffocation (49.3%), followed by a firearm (40.4%), and suicides among this age group were most often precipitated by mental health, family relationship, and school problems. Most suicides among decedents aged 18-24 years were by a firearm (46.2%), followed by hanging/strangulation/suffocation (37.4%), and were precipitated by mental health, substance abuse, intimate partner, and family problems.
   A recent crisis, an argument or conflict, or both were common precipitating circumstances among all youth suicide decedents.
   Interpretation: This report provides a detailed summary of data from NVDRS for 2016. Suicides rates were highest among nonHispanic American Indian/Alaska Native and white males, whereas homicide rates were highest among non-Hispanic black males. Mental health problems, intimate partner problems, interpersonal conflicts, and acute life stressors were primary precipitating events for multiple types of violent deaths, including suicides among youths aged 10-24 years.
   Public Health Action: NVDRS data are used to monitor the occurrence of violence-related fatal injuries and assist public health authorities in the development, implementation, and evaluation of programs and policies to reduce and prevent violent deaths. For example, Utah VDRS data were used to help identify suicide risk factors among youths aged 10-17 years, Rhode Island VDRS suicide data were analyzed to identify precipitating circumstances of youth suicides over a 10-year period, and Kansas VDRS data were used by the Kansas Youth Suicide Prevention Task Force. In 2019, NVDRS expanded data collection to include all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. This expansion is essential to public health efforts to reduce violent deaths.

AB Background: Suicidal behavior is a leading cause of injury and death worldwide. Several studies have provided a possible relationship between genetic factors and suicidal behavior. Also, these studies have shown evidence for altered serotonergic neural transmission in the pathogenesis of suicidal behavior. In addition, genes pertaining to the serotonergic system have been proposed as candidates to establish biological correlates between suicidal behavior and the serotonergic system. The most studied genes are SCL6A4, HTR2A, HTR2C, HTR1A, HTR1B, TPH-1, and TPH-2. To get a comprehensive understanding of the association with suicidal behavior we will conduct genotype assays studies in a Mexican population.
   Methods/Design: We will conduct a case-control study. The population sample will comprise adolescent and adult patients admitted for attempted of suicide and diagnosed by a psychiatrist. A peripheral blood sample will be taken from all the subjects (cases and controls). Genomic DNA from the leukocytes blood sample will be extracted. The genotypes of interest are distributed in the following genes: SCL6A4, HTR2A, HTR1A, HTR1B, HTR2C, TPH-2 and TPH-1. All the samples will be analyzed using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) end-point method. We will evaluate the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. The chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test will be used to compare genotype and allele frequencies between control and case groups. The Quanto 1.2 software will measure the sample size of the association. For all the association analyses the level of significance will be set at p = 0.05 and the confidence interval at 95%.
   Discussion: Suicidal behavior has been increase in Mexico, principally in young population. Our study will demonstrate the association between serotoninergic genes and suicide behavior in Mexican population.

AB Objective: To evaluate the clinical competence of Mexican and Guatemalan physicians to management the family dysfunction. Methods: Cross comparative study in four care units first in Guadalajara, Mexico, and four in Guatemala, Guatemala, based on a purposeful sampling, involving 117 and 100 physicians, respectively. Clinical competence evaluated by validated instrument integrated for 187 items. Non-parametric descriptive and inferential statistical analysis was performed. Results: The percentage of Mexican physicians with high clinical competence was 13.7%, medium 53%, low 24.8% and defined by random 8.5%. For the Guatemalan physicians' 14% was high, average 63%, and 23% defined by random. There were no statistically significant differences between healthcare country units, but between the medium of Mexicans (0.55) and Guatemalans (0.55) (p = 0.02). Conclusion: The proportion of the high clinical competency of Mexican physicians' was as Guatemalans.

AB IMPORTANCE Understanding global variation in firearm mortality rates could guide prevention policies and interventions.
   OBJECTIVE To estimate mortality due to firearm injury deaths from 1990 to 2016 in 195 countries and territories.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study used deidentified aggregated data including 13 812 location-years of vital registration data to generate estimates of levels and rates of death by age-sex-year-location. The proportion of suicides in which a firearm was the lethal means was combined with an estimate of per capita gun ownership in a revised proxy measure used to evaluate the relationship between availability or access to firearms and firearm injury deaths.
   EXPOSURES Firearm ownership and access.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cause-specific deaths by age, sex, location, and year.
   RESULTS Worldwide, it was estimated that 251 000 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 195 000-276 000) people died from firearm injuries in 2016, with 6 countries (Brazil, United States, Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, and Guatemala) accounting for 50.5%(95% UI, 42.2%-54.8%) of those deaths. In 1990, there were an estimated 209 000 (95% UI, 172 000 to 235 000) deaths from firearm injuries. Globally, the majority of firearm injury deaths in 2016 were homicides (64.0%[95% UI, 54.2%-68.0%]; absolute value, 161 000 deaths [95% UI, 107 000-182 000]); additionally, 27% were firearm suicide deaths (67 500 [95% UI, 55 400-84 100]) and 9% were unintentional firearm deaths (23 000 [95% UI, 18 200-24 800]). From 1990 to 2016, there was no significant decrease in the estimated global age-standardized firearm homicide rate (-0.2%[95% UI, -0.8% to 0.2%]). Firearm suicide rates decreased globally at an annualized rate of 1.6%(95% UI, 1.1-2.0), but in 124 of 195 countries and territories included in this study, these levels were either constant or significant increases were estimated. There was an annualized decrease of 0.9% (95% UI, 0.5%-1.3%) in the global rate of age-standardized firearm deaths from 1990 to 2016. Aggregate firearm injury deaths in 2016 were highest among persons aged 20 to 24 years (for men, an estimated 34 700 deaths [95% UI, 24 900-39 700] and for women, an estimated 3580 deaths [95% UI, 2810-4210]). Estimates of the number of firearms by country were associated with higher rates of firearm suicide (P<.001; R-2 = 0.21) and homicide (P<.001; R-2 = 0.35).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study estimated between 195 000 and 276 000 firearm injury deaths globally in 2016, the majority of which were firearm homicides. Despite an overall decrease in rates of firearm injury death since 1990, there was variation among countries and across demographic subgroups.

AB The main objective of this study was to analyze the direct and indirect relationships among sexting, cybervictimization, depression, and suicidal ideation. The sample consisted of 303 university students from Mexico (mean age=19.73, SD=1.73) who completed a questionnaire about the variables of interest. The relationships among the variables were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results show that sexting was associated with being the victim of cyberbullying, which, in turn, was related to depressive symptoms. In addition, sexting, cybervictimization, and depressive symptoms were significantly associated with suicidal ideation. These results contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between online risk behaviors, such as sexting, and their possible negative consequences, such as cybervictimization, depression, and suicidal ideation.

AB The present review aims at analyzing the magnitude and social impact of depression, as well as exploring models that help to understand the strategies needed to address this public health problem.
   The literature reveals that 9.2% of the general population has had a depressive episode and one in five persons will have an episode by age 75.
   Lower rates are observed in low and mid income in comparison to those with high income. These differences are not due to personal income, the probability of greater severity or delay in diagnosis, and are more likely related to cultural differences. Greater risk is observed among females, people younger than 60 years, marital status as single, widowed or divorced, and low educational attainment.
   The deleterious effect of depression on productivity is well established (27 days lost in the past year, on average, per case). The association with diabetes, hypertension, cardio vascular disease, drug use, suicide, and other risk behaviors has been frequently observed. Although unresolved questions remain about the presence or not of common risk factors and the chain of causality, it is a known fact that the combination of physical and mental disorders causes greater disability.
   With regard to the healthcare system, patients with depression and/or anxiety have higher utilization rates and healthcare costs, particularly among elderly patients. This healthcare overutilization is related with the low rates of diagnosis and adequate treatment of depression. About 26% of depression cases will not be diagnosed and, although a large proportion of patients have contact with healthcare services, nearly 30% never receive help for their depression.
   New treatment models that overcome barriers, understanding the sociocultural factors related with the problem, and addressing depression at the primary level of healthcare are urgent in Mexico.

ID PROGRAM
AB Problem/Condition: In 2014, approximately 59,000 persons died in the United States as a result of violence-related injuries. This report summarizes data from CDC's National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) regarding violent deaths from 18 U.S. states for 2014. Results are reported by sex, age group, race/ethnicity, marital status, location of injury, method of injury, circumstances of injury, and other selected characteristics.
   Reporting Period Covered: 2014.
   Description of System: NVDRS collects data from participating states regarding violent deaths. Data are obtained from death certificates, coroner/medical examiner reports, law enforcement reports, and secondary sources (e.g., child fatality review team data, supplemental homicide reports, hospital data, and crime laboratory data). This report includes data from 18 states that collected statewide data for 2014 (Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin). NVDRS collates documents for each death and links deaths that are related (e.g., multiple homicides, a homicide followed by a suicide, or multiple suicides) into a single incident.
   Results: For 2014, a total of 22,098 fatal incidents involving 22,618 deaths were captured by NVDRS in the 18 states included in this report. The majority of deaths were suicides (65.6%), followed by homicides (22.5%), deaths of undetermined intent (10.0%), deaths involving legal intervention (1.3%) (i.e., deaths caused by law enforcement and other persons with legal authority to use deadly force, excluding legal executions), and unintentional firearm deaths (< 1%). The term "legal intervention" is a classification incorporated into the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) and does not denote the lawfulness or legality of the circumstances surrounding a death caused by law enforcement. Suicides occurred at higher rates among males, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives (AI/AN), non-Hispanic whites, persons aged 45-54 years, and males aged = 75 years. Suicides were preceded primarily by a mental health, intimate partner, substance abuse, or physical health problem or a crisis during the previous or upcoming 2 weeks. Homicide rates were higher among males and persons aged < 1 year and 15-44 years; rates were highest among non-Hispanic black and AI/AN males. Homicides primarily were precipitated by arguments and interpersonal conflicts, occurrence in conjunction with another crime, or related to intimate partner violence (particularly for females). When the relationship between a homicide victim and a suspected perpetrator was known, it was most often either an acquaintance/ friend or an intimate partner. Legal intervention death rates were highest among males and persons aged 20-44 years; rates were highest among non-Hispanic black males and Hispanic males. Precipitating factors for the majority of legal intervention deaths were alleged criminal activity in progress, the victim reportedly using a weapon in the incident, a mental health or substance abuse problem, an argument or conflict, or a recent crisis. Deaths of undetermined intent occurred more frequently among males, particularly non-Hispanic black and AI/AN males, and persons aged 30-54 years. Substance abuse, mental health problems, physical health problems, and a recent crisis were the most common circumstances preceding deaths of undetermined intent. Unintentional firearm deaths were more frequent among males, non-Hispanic whites, and persons aged 10-24 years; these deaths most often occurred while the shooter was playing with a firearm and were most often precipitated by a person unintentionally pulling the trigger or mistakenly thinking the firearm was unloaded.
   Interpretation: This report provides a detailed summary of data from NVDRS for 2014. The results indicate that violent deaths resulting from self-inflicted or interpersonal violence disproportionately affected persons aged < 65 years, males, and certain minority populations. The primary precipitating factors for homicides and suicides were intimate partner problems, interpersonal conflicts, mental health and substance abuse problems, and recent crises.
   Public Health Action: NVDRS data are used to monitor the occurrence of violence-related fatal injuries and assist public health authorities in the development, implementation, and evaluation of programs and policies to reduce and prevent violent deaths. For example, North Carolina VDRS data were used to improve case ascertainment of pregnancy-associated suicides, Wisconsin VDRS data were used to develop the statewide suicide prevention strategy, and Colorado VDRS data were used to develop programs and prevention strategies for suicide among veterans. The continued development and expansion of NVDRS to include all U.S. states, territories, and the District of Columbia are essential to public health efforts to reduce the impact of violence.

NVDRS collates documents for each death and links deaths that are related (e.g., multiple homicides, a homicide followed by a suicide, or multiple suicides) from a single incident.
   Results: For 2013, a total of 18,765 fatal incidents involving 19,251 deaths were captured by NVDRS in the 17 states included in this report. The majority (66.2%) of deaths were suicides, followed by homicides (23.2%), deaths of undetermined intent (8.8%), deaths involving legal intervention (1.2%) (i.e., deaths caused by law enforcement and other persons with legal authority to use deadly force, excluding legal executions), and unintentional firearm deaths (<1%). (The term legal intervention is a classification incorporated into the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision [ICD-10] and does not denote the lawfulness or legality of the circumstances surrounding a death caused by law enforcement.)

Precipitating factors for the majority of legal intervention deaths were another crime, a mental health problem, or a recent crisis. Deaths of undetermined intent occurred at the highest rates among males and persons aged <1 year and 45-54 years. Substance abuse and mental or physical health problems were the most common circumstances preceding deaths of undetermined intent. Unintentional firearm death rates were higher among males, non-Hispanic whites, and persons aged persons aged 15-19 and 55-64 years; these deaths were most often precipitated by a person unintentionally pulling the trigger while playing with a firearm or while hunting.
   Interpretation: This report provides a detailed summary of data from NVDRS for 2013. The results indicate that violent deaths resulting from self-inflicted or interpersonal violence disproportionately affected persons aged <65 years, males, and certain minority populations.

   Public Health Action: NVDRS data are used to monitor the occurrence of violence-related fatal injuries and assist public health authorities in the development, implementation, and evaluation of programs and policies to reduce and prevent violent deaths. For example, Utah Violent Death Reporting System (VDRS) data were used to develop policies that support children of intimate partner homicide victims, Colorado VDRS data to develop a web-based suicide prevention program targeting middle-aged men, and Rhode Island VDRS data to help guide suicide prevention efforts at workplaces. The continued development and expansion of NVDRS to include all U.S. states, territories, and the District of Columbia are essential to public health efforts to reduce the impact of violence.

AB Resilience implies a process of positive adjustment to adverse conditions. The growing interest in their study demands the need for valid and reliable measurement instruments that allow assessments with scientific rigor in different types of populations. The aim of the present research was to analyze the psychometric properties of the Resilience Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents. 512 students from a high school of the University of Guadalajara, Mexico, participated. Exploratory factor analysis yielded a four-dimensional composition with 18 items than explain 61.18% of the variance, with an excellent level of reliability (alpha = .90). Through confirmatory factor analysis, the model was corroborated, presenting adequate levels of adjustment. Convergent validity was assessed using Rosenberg's Self-esteem Scale, obtaining significant positive correlations with the dimensions of resilience. The divergent validity was assessed through the Depression Scale of the Epidemiological Studies Center - Revised, showing significant negative correlations. Results and practical implications are discussed.

With this purpose, I will develop three areas of clear impact: participation in scientific ethical review committees, development of academic programs in bioethics and research and publication on ethics and bioethics. My motivation to enter in the program was that this training links psychosocial research with ethics and bioethics, which allows me to apply this type of reflection to problems such as violence, suicide, addictions, depression and mental health, and new fields such as community studies with vulnerable or at risk populations, in which the diverse implications are difficult to inquire.

AB Medical examiner/coroner's (ME/C) offices investigate sudden, violent, and unexpected deaths, leaving those close to the deceased suffering traumatic loss with little in terms of support and counseling. We investigated a grief services program (GSP) at the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator (OMI) to better understand the needs of bereaved individuals, identify the services provided, and propose our findings as a model for others. A total of 1085 contacts occurred over 1year, with the majority occurring at OMI (60.5%), followed by telephone (23.1%). Support was primarily provided to those suffering a loss due to homicide (28.8%) and suicide (26.1%). The roles grief counselors play in the setting of a GSP and ME/C office are multiple. Given the frequent utilization of OMI's GSP and diverse reasons for visits, it is apparent there is a need for GSPs at ME/C offices, particularly given the traumatic nature of deaths investigated by ME/Cs.

TI Alcohol control and injury death in Alaska native communities: Wet, damp
   and dry under Alaska's local option law
SO JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL
LA English
DT Article
ID INDIAN RESERVATIONS; NEW-MEXICO; SUICIDE
AB Objective: This article tests whether different forms of community-level alcohol control significantly affect injury deaths in a population with extremely high injury mortality. Method: The 1981 Alaska local option law provides a natural experiment for studying how implementation of community level controls may be associated with changes in injury deaths, most of which are alcohol-related, among Alaska Natives living in small communities. The study compares population and community-specific death rates under different levels of alcohol control for the 97 communities that passed restrictions between 1980 and 1993 with the death rates in the same communities during periods when no restrictions were in place. Results: Injury death rates were generally lower during periods when alcohol sales, importation or possession were restricted than when no restric-tions were in place (wet). More restrictive controls (dry) significantly reduced homicides; less restrictive control options (damp) reduced suicides. Accident and homicide death rates fell, on average, by 74 and 66 per 100,000, respectively, for the 89 communities that banned sale and importation or possession. A control group of 61 small communities that did not change control status under the law showed no significant changes over time in accident or homicide death rates. Conclusions: The changes in accidental and homicide death rates are statistically significant, although these reduced rates remain 2.5 to 7 times national death rates. The isolated nature of Alaskan villages may explain why alcohol control has more effect in Alaska than has been found in studies of Native Americans Living in other states.

ID DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; PREVALENCE; RISK
AB Studies carried out all over the world have pointed marital violence as a main public health issue. Nlost of such studies also show that women have several disadvantages when compared to males, for instance. in the United States the risk of partner homicide is 8 times higher for females than for males, and the risk for being injured by an armed partner is 7 times higher.
   In Mexico, epidemiological research of family violence is still incipient. One of the first epidemiological studies was developed in the Southern area Of Mexico City, the findings showed that around 38% of the women interviewed had been subjected to both physical and emotional violence at least once in their lifetime.
   On the other hand, 37% of the women attending public health care institutions had suffered some form of violence at least once during their lives while 21.6% had been abused by their partner during the previous year. The group more likely to suffer violence was between 31 and 45 Years and had low schooling. According to the Health Ministry the State with the highest prevalence of violence was Quintana Roo, and Aguascalientes had the lowest.
   The study of violence and its different manifestations often implies a significant rate of under registration, a fact due to its hidden nature. Thus, it is necessary to develop valid instruments to periodically assess this phenomenon in a reliable wand Therefore, the objective of the present paper is to present the factor validity of a scale aimed at assessing violence towards women in general population.
   Data were gathered in the Third National Survey on Addictions, which included an adapted version of the violence assessment scale. It was administered to urban women aged between 18 and 65 years, currently living with a partner, or who have once lived in couple. Different violent acts were explored as whether them, occurred once. in a lifetime or during the last year. The sample design was probabilistic, stratified, clustered and multi-stage, it was based upon the Basic Geostatistical Areas and the National Population Counting 1995. Interviewers were instructed regarding the specific requirements to hold an interview and to warrant the confidentiality of information. An exploratory factor analysis was performed with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows V10 using principal components method and varimax rotation. The resulting factors were analyzed according to sociodemographic variables; differences were verified through X-2 tests. The prevalence of both resulting factors was also obtained.
   The twelve items of the scale were grouped into two factors that altogether explain 52% of the total variance. The first factor was called physical and verbal volence because it includes acts that involve hearing, shouting at, and threatening women. The second factor was named threats of suicide and death. Finally a confirmatory factor analyses was performed (EQS for Windows V.6). The internal consistency coefficient was 0.86 for the physical and verbal violence factor and 0.68 for threats of death and suicide.
   The presence of physical and verbal violence was significantly higher among women with less schooling and lower income, separated or divorced, non-religious and who also reported domestic violence in their family of origin. Separated and divorced women, as well as women with family history of violence also had more threats of suicide and death.
   The main contribution of the present paper is the scale used to assess situations where emotional and physical violence towards women is involved. It is important that these data contribute to policy making to protect children and facilitate special support to women and their aggressors.

ID RELIABILITY
AB Introduction
   Epidemiological studies in our country show increases in the consumption of illegal drugs and alcohol. The age of onset has decreased, especially regarding alcohol use. Meanwhile, consumption of inhalants has increased significantly, especially among young women. There are several factors associated with drug use, but the development of resistance strategies, along with its underlying social skills and parenting styles, stand out in a significant way.
   Method
   Data comes from a probabilistic survey carried out in November 2012, with students from 7th to 12th school grades, in Mexico City, which was representative for each of its districts. The sample was 26503 students. Information was obtained through a questionnaire standardized and validated in previous surveys.
   Results
   Tobacco consumption decreased significantly (44.3% to 41.0%), 32.9% of the adolescents began its use before age 13. Lifetime consumption of alcohol was 68.2%, while the average age of onset of cannabis use remained at 12.6 years. Lifetime prevalence of any drug use increased from 21.5% to 24.4%. Marijuana was the first drug of choice among students (15.9%). Increases were also found in sexual abuse rate, while suicide attempt decreased.
   Discussion
   Although inhalants use remained stable and tobacco use decreased significantly, results show the continued growth of drug use. Given this context, concentrating more efforts in prevention with studies and evaluated interventions for pre-school and elementary school students, as well as for parents and teachers, is a preponderant task.

AB Background: The idea to accelerate the process of death in a terminally ill patient is an issue that has polarized societies since ancient times. The purpose of this study is to describe and analyze the opinion of medical students from Nuevo Leon, Mexico, about passive euthanasia, active euthanasia, and their personal posture on the topic.
   Material and Methods: Using a three-part questionnaire, 1,319 medical students of the first three years of medical school, from three of the four medical schools in the state, were interviewed. The questionnaire included questions on demographics, religion, and the personal posture of the student on active euthanasia, passive euthanasia, and their personal posture on the topic.
   Results: Of those interviewed, 44.4% were in favor of active euthanasia, 52.1% of passive euthanasia, and 44.8% had a positive personal posture on the topic. Age and grade were not significant variables for the posture of the students, but the variable gender showed a predominantly positive posture in the male subgroup for active (p=0.001) and passive euthanasia (p=0.031). Religion and the importance of religion/spirituality in daily life were the most significant factors (p<0.005) for the interviewees to hold a negative posture in each of the three scenarios. The legal nature of the scenario (p=0.000) and respect for patient's autonomy (p=0.000) were the most important arguments that could change an original negative posture into a positive one.

AB The incidence of prostate cancer has dramatically increased worldwide in the past decade, with mortality rates also increasing in many countries. Once prostate cancer is diagnosed, it is important to rapidly begin a treatment regimen that is either potentially curative or impedes disease progression. When the disease is confined to the prostate, it can be cured by radical prostatectomy or irradiation therapy. However, there are no curative therapies for locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic diseases. Clearly, new therapies are needed for these patients. Gene therapy may provide additional therapeutic options with the potential to affect both localized and metastatic disease. Virus-mediated transduction of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) gene transfer, followed by a course of the prodrug ganciclovir (GCV), so-called suicide gene therapy, has been demonstrated by several investigators. The present in situ gene therapy clinical trial for human prostate cancer demonstrated safety, clinical efficacy, and biological effects of antitumor activity. HSV-tk clinical trials for prostate cancer are also ongoing in Japan, the Netherlands, and Mexico. Currently, numerous preclinical studies have reported immunomodulatory cytokine gene therapy, such as interleukin-2, interleukin-12, B7-1 (CD80), B7-2 (CD86) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Several clinical studies have been approved that potentially will show that these immunomodulatory gene therapies may generate an effective local and systemic antitumor activity and that should provide options for patients with prostate cancer. We review the multiple issues involved in current in situ gene therapy (gene/immunotherapy), its outcome, and future directions for patients with prostate cancer.

   PROGRAM; WOMEN; RISK
AB Problem/Condition: In 2015, approximately 62,000 persons died in the United States as a result of violence-related injuries. This report summarizes data from CDC's National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) regarding violent deaths from 27 U.S. states for 2015. Results are reported by sex, age group, race/ethnicity, location of injury, method of injury, circumstances of injury, and other selected characteristics.
   Reporting Period: 2015.
   Description of System: NVDRS collects data regarding violent deaths obtained from death certificates, coroner/medical examiner reports, law enforcement reports, and secondary sources (e.g., child fatality review team data, supplemental homicide reports, hospital data, and crime laboratory data). This report includes data from 27 states that collected statewide data for 2015 (Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin). NVDRS collates documents for each death and links deaths that are related (e.g., multiple homicides, a homicide followed by a suicide, or multiple suicides) into a single incident.
   Results: For 2015, NVDRS captured 30,628 fatal incidents involving 31,415 deaths in the 27 states included in this report. The majority (65.1%) of deaths were suicides, followed by homicides (23.5%), deaths of undetermined intent (9.5%), legal intervention deaths (1.3%) (i.e., deaths caused by law enforcement and other persons with legal authority to use deadly force, excluding legal executions), and unintentional firearm deaths (<1.0%). (The term "legal intervention" is a classification incorporated into the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision [ICD-10] and does not denote the lawfulness or legality of the circumstances surrounding a death caused by law enforcement.) Demographic patterns varied by manner of death. Suicide rates were highest among males, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives, non-Hispanic whites, adults aged 45-54 years, and men aged >= 75years. The most common method of injury was a firearm. Suicides often were preceded by a mental health, intimate partner, substance abuse, or physical health problem, or a crisis during the previous or upcoming 2 weeks. Homicide rates were higher among males and persons aged <1 year and 20-34 years. Among males, non-Hispanic blacks accounted for the majority of homicides and had the highest rate of any racial/ethnic group. Homicides primarily involved a firearm, were precipitated by arguments and interpersonal conflicts, were related to intimate partner violence (particularly for females), or occurred in conjunction with another crime. When the relationship between a homicide victim and a suspected perpetrator was known, an acquaintance/friend or an intimate partner frequently was involved. Legal intervention death rates were highest among males and persons aged 20-54 years; rates among non-Hispanic black males were approximately double the rates of those among non-Hispanic white males. Precipitating circumstances for legal intervention deaths most frequently were an alleged criminal activity in progress, the victim reportedly using a weapon in the incident, a mental health or substance abuse problem (other than alcohol abuse), an argument or conflict, or a recent crisis (during the previous or upcoming 2 weeks). Unintentional firearm deaths were more frequent among males, non-Hispanic whites, and persons aged 10-24 years; these deaths most often occurred while the shooter was playing with a firearm and most often were precipitated by a person unintentionally pulling the trigger or mistakenly thinking the firearm was unloaded. Deaths of undetermined intent were more frequent among males, particularly non-Hispanic black and American Indian/Alaska Native males, and persons aged 30-54 years. Substance abuse, mental health problems, physical health problems, and a recent crisis were the most common circumstances preceding deaths of undetermined intent. In 2015, approximately 3,000 current or former military personnel died by suicide. The majority of these decedents were male, non-Hispanic white, and aged 45-74 years. Most suicides among military personnel involved a firearm and were precipitated by mental health, physical health, and intimate partner problems, as well as a recent crisis.
   Interpretation: This report provides a detailed summary of data from NVDRS for 2015. The results indicate that deaths resulting from self-inflicted or interpersonal violence most frequently affect males and certain age groups and minority populations. Mental health problems, intimate partner problems, interpersonal conflicts, and general life stressors were primary precipitating events for multiple types of violent deaths, including suicides among current or former military personnel.
   Public Health Action: NVDRS data are used to monitor the occurrence of violence-related fatal injuries and assist public health authorities in the development, implementation, and evaluation of programs and policies to reduce and prevent violent deaths. For example, Virginia VDRS data are used to help identify suicide risk factors among active duty service members, Oregon VDRS suicide data are used to coordinate information and activities across community agencies that support veterans and active duty service members, and Arizona VDRS data are used to develop recommendations for primary care providers who deliver care to veterans. The continued development and expansion of NVDRS to include all 50 states, U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia are essential to public health efforts to reduce deaths due to violence.

AB It is uncertain whether Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) countries are approaching a single mortality regime. Over the last three decades, LAC has experienced major public health interventions and the highest number of homicides in the world. However, these interventions and homicide rates are not evenly shared across countries. This study documents trends in life expectancy and lifespan variability for 20 LAC countries, 2000-14. By extending a previous method, we decompose differences in lifespan variability between LAC and a developed world benchmark into cause-specific effects. For both sexes, dispersion of amenable diseases through the age span makes the largest contribution to the gap between LAC and the benchmark. Additionally, for males, the concentration of homicides, accidents, and suicides in mid-life further impedes mortality convergence. Great disparity exists in the region: while some countries are rapidly approaching the developed regime, others remain far behind and suffer a clear disadvantage in population health.

ID RIO-DE-JANEIRO; MATERNAL MORTALITY
AB This study measured the contribution of abortion-related deaths to overall maternal mortality and calculated the underestimation of maternal mortality using verbal autopsy and clinical record review where available. We reviewed 807 death certificates of women aged 72-50 who died in 2001 in two sites of about 1.5 million inhabitants each in the state of Morelos (primarily rural) and the municipality of Nezahualcoyotl (primarily urban) in the state of Mexico. Deaths were classified as definite, possible or non-maternal deaths. Finally we identified abortion-related deaths and calculated the underestimation of maternal mortality Among 326 possible maternal deaths, we encountered five misclassified cases: one spontaneous abortion and four non-abortion maternal deaths. Among 32 registered maternal deaths, we found four misclassified cases that were actually second trimester, abortion-related deaths. There were no officially registered abortion-related deaths in either Morelos or Nezahualcoyotl, making the overall underestimation of abortion mortality 100%. Abortion contributed 73.5% of all maternal deaths. The overall underestimation of maternal mortality was 13.5%, higher in Morelos (21.7%). There were no unregistered maternal deaths in Nezohualcoyotl. Unsafe abortion continues to be an important cause of maternal mortality, though first trimester deaths appear to be decreasing. We identified domestic violence as on important cause of death among pregnant and post-partum women, and two abortion-related suicides, and believe these should be reconsidered as indirect maternal deaths. The misclassification of second trimester abortion deaths as maternal deaths from other causes is an obstacle to preventing them. (c) 2004 Reproductive Health Matters. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction. The desire to hasten death (DHD) might be present in patients with advanced cancer. Multiple distressing physical and psychosocial symptoms may be related to it. There is limited literature about the characteristics of these patients in Mexico. Objective. To describe the prevalence and factors associated with DHD in advanced cancer patients evaluated by a palliative care psychiatrist. Method. We conducted a cross-sectional study, including all patients referred to psychiatric assessment at the Servicio de Cuidados Paliativos of the Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia in Mexico City, from January to December 2016. DHD was defined as the presence of death ideas, suicidal ideation, and/or request for euthanasia or medically assisted suicide. Patients with delirium, dementia, psychosis, or uncontrolled physical symptoms were excluded. Results. Sixty-four patients were included in the study. Most of them were women (59%); the mean age was 49 years old (SD = 16). Of them, 64% met criteria for a major depressive disorder, 64% for generalized anxiety disorder and/or panic disorder, and 11% for substance use disorders. 44% expressed DHD. In a multivariate regression analysis predicting DHD, only one factor emerged: clinical depression (OR = 13.5, p =.002, 95% CI [02.562, 71.726]). Discussion and conclusion. The desire to hasten death is a frequent issue for the patients evaluated at the psychiatric palliative care clinic. Depression and other distressing psychiatric pathologies were associated with DHD. Interdisciplinary interventions are needed to treat DHD. More research is warranted in order to understand the factors associated with the expression of DHD.

AB Objectives. We examined migration to the United States as a risk factor for suicidal behavior among people of Mexican origin.
   Methods. We pooled data from 2 nationally representative surveys in the United States (2001-2003; n=1284) and Mexico (2001-2002; n=5782). We used discrete time survival models to account for time-varying and time-invariant characteristics, including psychiatric disorders.
   Results. Risk for suicidal ideation was higher among Mexicans with a family member in the United States (odds ratio [OR]=1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.06,2.11), Mexican-born immigrants who arrived in the United States at 12 years or younger (OR=1.84; 95% CI=1.09, 3.09), and US-born Mexican Americans (OR=1.56; 95% CI=1.03, 2.38) than among Mexicans with neither a history of migration to the United States nor a family member currently living there. Risk for suicide attempts was also higher among Mexicans with a family member in the United States (OR= 1.68; 95% CI=1.13, 2.52) and US-born Mexican Americans (OR=1.97; 95% CI=1.06, 3.65). Selection bias caused by differential migration or differential return migration of persons at higher risk of suicidal ideation or attempt did not account for these findings.
   Conclusions. Public health efforts should focus on the impact of Mexico-US migration on family members of migrants and on US-born Mexican Americans. (Am J Public Health. 2009;99:728-733. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2008.135160)

AB Background: Infection with Toxoplasma gondii can be acquired via the ingestion of undercooked or raw meat containing tissue cysts, or via ingestion of water contaminated with oocysts. Professional long distance truck driving may have epidemiological importance for food-borne infections since drivers eat out of home and in places where hygiene and cooking practices are uncertain. We aimed to determine whether interstate truck drivers in Durango, Mexico have an increased risk of infection with T. gondii as indicated by seropositivity; and to determine the socio-demographic, work, clinical, and behavioral characteristics associated with T. gondii seropositivity in interstate truck drivers.
   Methods: Through a case-control study design, 192 truck drivers and 192 controls from the general population of the same region matched by gender and age were examined with enzyme-linked immunoassays for the presence of anti-Toxoplasma IgG and IgM antibodies. Socio-demographic, work, clinical and behavioral characteristics from the truck drivers were obtained.
   Results: Anti-T. gondii IgG antibodies were found in 23 (12.0%) of 192 truck drivers and in 13 (6.8%) of 192 controls (OR = 21.0; 95% CI: 1.23-358.38; P = 0.002). Anti-T. gondii IgM antibodies were found in 7 (3.6%) cases and in 7 (3.6%) controls (P = 1.00). The seroprevalence of T. gondii infection was higher in drivers with reflex impairment than in those without this impairment (4/13, 30.8% vs 19/179, 10.6%, respectively; P = 0.05), and in drivers with hearing impairment than in those without this impairment (3/7, 42.9% vs 20/185, 10.8%, respectively; P = 0.03). Multivariate analysis of work and behavioral characteristics of truck drives showed positive associations of T. gondii exposure with trips to the south of Mexico (OR = 3.11; 95% CI: 1.02-9.44; P = 0.04) and consumption of horse meat (OR = 5.18; 95% CI: 1.62-16.55; P = 0.005).
   Conclusions: Results suggest that interstate truck drivers may have an increased risk for T. gondii infection, and that T. gondii exposure may be impacting neurological functions in truck drivers. Contributing factors for T. gondii exposure should be taken into account for the design of optimal prevention measures against T. gondii infection.

TI Surveillance for Violent Deaths - National Violent Death Reporting
   System, 16 States, 2010
SO MMWR SURVEILLANCE SUMMARIES
LA English
DT Article
AB Problem/Condition: An estimated 55,000 persons die annually in the United States as a result of violence-related injuries. This report summarizes data from CDC's National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) regarding violent deaths from 16 U. S. states for 2010. Results are reported by sex, age group, race/ethnicity, marital status, location of injury, method of injury, circumstances of injury, and other selected characteristics.
   Reporting Period Covered: 2010.
   Description of System: NVDRS collects data regarding violent deaths obtained from death certificates, coroner/medical examiner reports, law enforcement reports, and secondary sources (e. g., child fatality review team data, supplementary homicide reports, hospital data, and crime laboratory data). NVDRS data collection began in 2003 with seven states (Alaska, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, South Carolina, and Virginia) participating; six states (Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin) joined in 2004, four (California, Kentucky, New Mexico, and Utah) in 2005, and two in 2010 (Ohio and Michigan), for a total of 19 states. This report includes data from 16 states that collected statewide data in 2010; data from California are not included in this report because data were not collected after 2009. Ohio and Michigan were excluded because data collection, which began in 2010, did not occur statewide until 2011.
   Results: For 2010, a total of 15,781 fatal incidents involving 16,186 deaths were captured by NVDRS in the 16 states included in this report. The majority (62.8%) of deaths were suicides, followed by homicides and deaths involving legal intervention (i.e., deaths caused by law enforcement and other persons with legal authority to use deadly force, excluding legal executions) (24.4%), deaths of undetermined intent (12.2%), and unintentional firearm deaths (0.7%). Suicides occurred at higher rates among males, non-Hispanic whites, American Indians/Alaska Natives, and persons aged 45-54 years. Suicides most often occurred in a house or apartment and involved the use of firearms. Suicides were preceded primarily by a mental health or intimate partner problem, a crisis during the previous 2 weeks, or a physical health problem. Homicides occurred at higher rates among males and persons aged 20-24 years; rates were highest among non-Hispanic black males. The majority of homicides involved the use of a firearm and occurred in a house or apartment or on a street/highway. Homicides were precipitated primarily by arguments and interpersonal conflicts or in conjunction with another crime.
   Interpretation: This report provides a detailed summary of data from NVDRS for 2010. The results indicate that violent deaths resulting from self-inflicted or interpersonal violence disproportionately affected persons aged < 55 years, males, and certain minority populations. For homicides and suicides, relationship problems, interpersonal conflicts, mental health problems, and recent crises were among the primary precipitating factors. Because additional information might be reported subsequently as participating states update their findings, the data provided in this report are preliminary.
   Public Health Action: For the occurrence of violent deaths in the United States to be better understood and ultimately prevented, accurate, timely, and comprehensive surveillance data are necessary. NVDRS data can be used to monitor the occurrence of violence-related fatal injuries and assist public health authorities in the development, implementation, and evaluation of programs and policies to reduce and prevent violent deaths at the national, state, and local levels. NVDRS data have been used to enhance prevention programs. Examples include use of linked NVDRS data and adult protective service data to better target elder maltreatment prevention programs and improve staff training to identify violent death risks for older adults in North Carolina, use of Oklahoma VDRS homicide data to help evaluate the effectiveness of a new police and advocate intervention at domestic violence incident scenes, and data-informed changes in primary care practice in Oregon to more effectively address older adult suicide prevention. The continued development and expansion of NVDRS is essential to CDC's efforts to reduce the personal, familial, and societal impacts of violence. Further efforts are needed to increase the number of states participating in NVDRS, with an ultimate goal of full national representation.

TI Trends in cause-specific mortality among children aged 5-14 years from
   2005 to 2016 in India, China, Brazil, and Mexico: an analysis of
   nationally representative mortality studies
SO LANCET
LA English
DT Article
ID SURVEILLANCE; BURDEN
AB Background With global survival increasing for children younger than 5 years of age, attention is required to reduce the approximately 1 million deaths of children aged 5-14 years occurring every year. Causes of death at these ages remain poorly documented. We aimed to explore trends in mortality by causes of death in India, China, Brazil, and Mexico, which are home to about 40% of the world's children aged 5-14 years and experience more than 200 000 deaths annually at these ages.
   Methods We examined data on 244 401 deaths in children aged 5-14 years from four nationally representative data sources that obtained direct distributions of causes of death: the Indian Million Death Study, the Chinese Disease Surveillance Points, mortality data from the Mexican Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia, and mortality data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. We present data on 12 main disease groups in all countries, with breakdown by communicable and nutritional diseases, non-communicable diseases, injuries, and ill-defined causes. To calculate age-specific and sex-specific death rates for each cause, we applied the national cause of death distribution to the UN mortality envelopes for 2005-16 for each country.
   Findings Unlike Brazil, China, and Mexico, communicable diseases still account for nearly half of deaths in India in children aged 5-14 years (73 920 [46.1%] of 160 330 estimated deaths in 2016). In 2016, India had the highest death rates in nearly every category, including from communicable diseases. Fast declines among girls in communicable disease mortality narrowed the gap by 2016 with boys in India (32.6 deaths per 100 000 girls vs 26.2 per 100 000 boys) and China (1.7 vs 1.5). In China, injuries accounted for the greatest proportions of deaths (20 970 [53.2%] of 39 430 estimated deaths, in which drowning was a leading cause). The homicide death rate at ages 10-14 years was higher for boys than for girls in Brazil, increasing annually by an average of 0.7% (0.3-1.1). In India and China, the suicide death rates were higher for girls than for boys at ages 10-14 years. By contrast, in Mexico it was higher for boys than for girls, increasing annually by an average of 2.8% (2.0-3.6). Deaths from transport injuries, drowning, and cancer are common in all four countries, with transport accidents among the top three causes of death for both sexes in all countries, except for Indian girls, and cancer in the top three causes for both sexes in Mexico, Brazil, and China.
   Interpretation Most of the deaths that occurred between 2005 and 2016 in children aged 5-14 years in India, China, Brazil, and Mexico arose from preventable or treatable conditions. This age group is important for extending some of the global disease-specific targets developed for children younger than 5 years of age. Interventions to control noncommunicable diseases and injuries and to strengthen cause of death reporting systems are also required.

AB Objective To compare the drowning mortality rates and proportion of deaths of each intent among all drowning deaths in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries in 2012-2014.
   Design A population-based cross-sectional study.
   Setting 32 OECD countries.
   Participants Individuals in OECD countries who died from drowning.
   Main outcome measures Drowning mortality rates (deaths per 100000 population) and proportion (%) of deaths of each intent (ie, unintentional intent, intentional self-harm, assault, undetermined intent and all intents combined) among all drowning deaths.
   Results Countries with the highest drowning mortality rates (deaths per 100000 population) were Estonia (3.53), Japan (3.49) and Greece (2.40) for unintentional intent; Ireland (0.96), Belgium (0.96) and Korea (0.89) for intentional self-harm; Austria (0.57), Korea (0.56) and Hungary (0.44) for undetermined intent and Japan (4.35), Estonia (3.70) and Korea (2.73) for all intents combined. Korea ranked 12th and 3rd for unintentional intent and all intents combined, respectively. By contrast, Belgium ranked 2nd and 15th for intentional self-harm and all intents combined, respectively. The proportion of deaths of each intent among all drowning deaths in each country varied greatly: from 26.2% in Belgium to 96.8% in Chile for unintentional intent; 0.7% in Mexico to 57.4% in Belgium for intentional self-harm; 0.0% in nine countries to 4.9% in Mexico for assault and 0.0% in Israel and Turkey to 38.3% in Austria for undetermined intent.
   Conclusions A large variation in the practice of classifying undetermined intent in drowning deaths across countries was noted and this variation hinders valid international comparisons of intent-specific (unintentional and intentional self-harm) drowning mortality rates.

AB Objective. To describe a four-year descriptive, naturalistic study monitoring the use of HDep (Help for Depression or Ayuda para depression (ADep) in Spanish), an openaccess/ free Web-based, psycho-education, cognitive-behavioral intervention program produced in Mexico consisting of seven self-help modules that include feedback-generating assessments of depressive symptoms, vignettes, recorded messages, a relaxation exercise, a personal workbook, blogs, and user discussion forums.
   Methods. Data were collected on all individuals who entered the HDep site since the program's launching in 2009. Those who entered the site two or more times and also registered as "users" or "participants." The user data consisted of 1) user profiles; 2) scores for the CES-D (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale), for users who completed the feedback-generating assessments of depressive symptoms; 3) user evaluations of the usefulness of HDep; and 4) transcripts of HDep discussion forum posts. The raw user data were obtained through Moodle (Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment, a free software e-learning platform) and analyzed quantitatively (using SPSS) and qualitatively (using ATLAS.ti).
   Results. A total of 28 078 individuals accessed HDep and 17 318 of those (61.6%) qualified as users. Of all users, 84.4% were women, 64.6% used the workbook, and 60.9% entered the discussion forums (of whom 16.3% added a post). Depressive symptoms (CES-D score >= 16) were observed in 97.1% of the users who completed the feedback-generating assessment (n = 16 564). User retention dropped across the seven modules (from 12 366 users for Module 1 to 626 for Module 7). However, all seven modules were rated very high for "helpfulness/usefulness," with mean scores all above 4 on a 1-5 scale. The HDep discussion forums showed a rich social interaction. Predictors of entering at least one module (based on stepwise logistic regression analysis) included being a woman, being = 30 years old, reporting disability, and having attempted suicide. Of the 72 participants who completed the final user evaluation of HDep, 97.5% said it had an enormous influence on helping them to identify and transform negative thoughts.
   Conclusions. Despite the high attrition among users, and the need for further structure adaptation, HDep can be considered a potentially useful mental health tool in Mexico for 1) detecting depression (via the CES-D assessments) and 2) providing a means of social support to those with depression. The high levels of depressive symptoms detected among users suggest that the role of free-access, self-help, Web-based interventions in public mental health programs should be further investigated. The effectiveness of HDep in reducing depressive symptoms and providing a support system has yet to be assessed and should be examined in future research.

AB Objective: New Mexico (NM) has the highest rate of non-firearm-related homicide in the USA and ranks 20th in firearm-related homicides. Because non-firearm-related homicides are inadequately described in the literature, characterisation of non-firearm-related homicide victims will enhance efforts to reduce homicides.
   Methods: Homicide victims were identified through the Office of the Medical Investigator. Age-specific and age-adjusted homicide death rates were calculated for 2001-3 by sex and race/ethnicity, and associations between covariates and non-firearm-related homicide were measured.
   Results: Non-firearm-related homicides comprised 33% of US homicide victims, 47% of NM homicide victims, and 74% of NM American Indian (AI) homicide victims. Of 212 NM non-firearm-related homicide victims, 37% had been beaten, 32% had been stabbed, and 12% had been strangled. Females comprised 30% of non-firearm-related homicide victims and 18% of firearm-related homicide victims. A blood alcohol concentration (BAC) >= 0.08 mg/dl was detected among 43% of non-firearm-related (61% of AI) and 33% of firearm-related (50% of AI) homicide victims. Non-firearm-related homicide rates were highest among AI men aged 25-34 years (31/100 000). Non-firearm-related homicide victims were more likely than firearm-related victims to be AI (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 4.20; 95% CI 2.16 to 8.16) and female (AOR 2.05; 95% CI 1.27 to 3.31), and to have had a BAC >= 0.08 mg/dl (AOR 1.65; 95% CI 1.08 to 2.52).
   Conclusions: Homicide-prevention efforts among AIs in NM should focus on non-firearm-related homicides. The association between excessive drinking and non-firearm-related homicide should be further characterised. Continued surveillance for non-firearm-related homicides will assist these efforts.

AB Objectives. We examined the prevalence of trauma in 2 large American Indian communities in an attempt to describe demographic correlates and to compare findings with a representative sample of the US population.
   Methods. We determined differences in exposure to each of 16 types of trauma among 3084 tribal members aged 15 to 57 years through structured interviews. We compared prevalence rates of trauma, by gender, across the 2 tribes and with a sample of the US general population. We used logistic regression analyses to examine the relationships of demographic correlates to trauma exposure.
   Results. Lifetime exposure rates to at least 1 trauma (62.4%-67.2% among male participants, 66.2%-69.8% among female participants) fell at the upper limits of the range reported by other researchers. Unlike the US general population, female and male American Indians exhibited equivalent levels of overall trauma exposure. Members of both tribes more often witnessed traumatic events, experienced traumas to loved ones, and were victims of physical attacks than their counterparts in the overall US population.
   Conclusions. American Indians live in adverse environments that place them at high risk for exposure to trauma and harmful health sequelae.

AB Purpose: To explore the association of socioeconomic status (SES) with disordered eating behaviors (DEB) in Mexican adolescents, and the coexistence of DEB and other problem behaviors.
   Methods: Information about adolescents (10-19 years) was retrieved from the Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey 2006 database. Associations were evaluated through ordinal regression.
   Results: Higher SES was associated with DEB (odds ratio [OR]: 2.05, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.52-2.75). Use of tobacco (OR: 2.10, 95% CI: 1.58-2.81), alcohol (OR: 2.03, 95% CI: 1.51-2.56), and suicide intent (OR: 5.13, 95% CI: 3.46-7.60) were associated with DEB.
   Conclusion: DEB were more frequent among adolescents from higher SES households. The lack of association between SES and DEB reported by other studies might be because of the lack of variability in samples. The association of DEB and other problem behaviors highlights the importance of an integral approach to teenagers' mental health. (C) 2011 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

AB Context: Many states and local areas are affected by the national epidemic of drug-related mortality, which recently has shown signs of a rising "licit-to-illicit drug" death ratio. Appropriate local public health surveillance can help monitor and control this epidemic. Objective: Using our state as an example, we sought to illustrate how to describe the changes in drug death rates, causes, and circumstances. In contrast to most other surveillance reports, our approach includes both drug-induced and drug-related deaths as well as both demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of decedents. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: All residents of the state of Wisconsin. Participants: Decedents from 1999 to 2008. Main Outcome Measure: Annual numbers and population-based rates of deaths due to drugs, including both identified and unidentified drugs. Information was obtained from death certificates with any of approximately 270 underlying, immediate, or contributing cause-of-death codes from the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. Results: Drug-related death rates increased during much of the 10-year study period, and the male-to-female death ratio rose. The median age at death from drug-related causes was 43 years. Opioid analgesic poisoning surpassed cocaine and heroin poisoning as the most frequent type of fatal drug poisoning. Of all 4828 deaths from drug-related causes-virtually all of which were certified by a county medical examiner or coroner-3410 (71%) were unintentional and 1053 (22%) were suicides. The unintentional-to-suicide death rate ratio grew from 1.6 to 3.5 during the study period. Methadone-related deaths increased from 10 in 1999 to 118 in 2008 (1080%), while benzodiazepine-related deaths rose from 23 to 106 (361%). Conclusions: Although premature deaths from drug use and abuse continue to rise, even surpassing deaths due to motor vehicle crash in some states, "multiple causes of death" information from death certificates is available to monitor their occurrence and nature and to inform selection of prevention strategies.

AB The scientific work of the Social and Epidemiological Research Division of the Mexican Institute of Psychiatry during 20 years of investigation on social and epidemiological issues on the most relevant problems of mental health and addictions in Mexico, constitutes an important database, both theoretical and empirical, enough to supply the contents for possible prevention programs.
   The available understructure, including materials related to methodologies, research instruments, epidemiological and statistical data, information about risk and protective factors around specific problems, such as drug abuse, alcoholism, family violence, affective disorders, suicide, and other problems inside risk groups, such as street children and women, is the basic element to design and to apply both general prevention programs and focused intervention actions.
   The main objective of this paper is to suggest some global and concrete strategies for designing and applying prevention programs in mental health, base on the results of the social and epidemiological research developed in the Mexican Institute of Psychiatry.
   The strategies proposed are oriented mainly to divulge information about the most recent developments in this field and to generate education programs related to mental health, mental illness and addictions, addressed to the general community and to specific risk groups.
   Even though the institute has reached an important level in spreading research results, this has been done through publications in specialized magazines, its participation in scientific congresses, edition of books and its journal Salud Mental However this information is planned to reach only the national and internacional scientific community, specialized in mental health. We consider as a basic need to encourage the divulgation of scientific results, specifically of those from social and epidemiological areas, among the general public, who must receive the final benefits of the scientific work done in mental health during the last years. This means that people suffering from mental problems, their families, the social groups in great risk and the general population will participate more activity in prevention programs if they have access to the proper education and information.

AB Social changes observed in the last decades, -derived from variations in the demographic structure of the population with an increase in the absolute numbers of adolescents and persons from the third age with special vulnerabilities for substance abuse; recurrent economical crisis where problems derived from the increasing level of drug abuse among this group are added to those that result from poverty and lack of opportunities, and modernization and globalization as well- have affected the lives of persons in the individual, familial and social areas where drug abuse is immersed. To the traditional problem of alcohol abuse among middle-aged males, no-v females and adolescents are abusing alcohol imitating adult models where drinking anti drunkenness are often to linked. In spite of the change in social perception that associates tobacco use with health risks, Mexican adolescents, specially females, are smoking more. To the traditional problem of inhalation of solvents with psychotropic effects among children and adolescents and of marihuana among youth and some groups of the adult population, an increasing use of cocaine is observed, a trend that includes children and the poor sector of the population. An increasing use of IV drug use, an epidemic outbreak of heroin in selected cities bordering the United States, and the emergence of new drugs such as met-ampheramines, are now part of the drug subculture. The article describes some recent trends in drug use and changes observed from the 1970's, and discusses the perspectives for the future regarding the social contest. The relation between drug use, sexual risk behavior and delinquency is discussed. The association with accidents and different forms of violence, including suicide and intrafamily violence, is also analyzed. The macro determinants of the problem and their relation to drug use (globalization, economical development and inequalities, migration, changes in gender roles and family composition) are reviewed. The article finishes with an overview of the challenges for the future and research need.

AB This article analyzes the impact of firearms in the homicides of young people in Latin America today. A cross-sectional descriptive epidemiological study was carried out based on data from the Pan American Health Organization. There were 14,427 deaths due to assaults with firearms in young people, that is, a rate of 14.3 per 100,000 young people for the year 2014 in Latin America. Thus, 80% of all homicides in young people between 10 to 19 years of age in the region were committed with firearms. This especially affects young males, with a rate of 26.5 per 100,000 deaths due to assault with firearms, although it should not be overlooked that the deaths among women are largely femicides. In addition, 1,828 deaths of undetermined intent with firearms (especially in Argentina and Venezuela) and 284 deaths with firearms in legal interventions (showing higher policy lethality among young people) were registered. The corrected rate is therefore 16.4 young people killed by others with firearms per 100,000 youth in Latin America. The need for gun control and disarmament policies, de-stigmatization campaigns and youth development programs is discussed, in order to reduce the current conditions that foster and invisibilize the so-called "armed juvenicide" in Latin America.

ID MEXICO
AB Introduction
   Nowadays, suicide is a public health problem and a social phenomenon that affects human development. From 1995 to 2002, the state of Sonora showed a 3.8% annual average increase in the occurrence of suicide in productive age population, occupying the national third place with regard to this problem's growth. During the 1970's suicide in groups of infants and school children between 5 and 14 years old started to be noticed in the country. At present time, self-inflicted injuries are eighth cause of death for this age group.
   Suicidal behavior is a process comprised by several stages passive suicidal ideation, active contemplation of suicide itself, planning and preparation, suicide attempt execution, and completed suicide. Since these stages may or not be sequential, it is important to study the steps preceding suicides, such as the ideation and the attempt, in order to know and treat this problem. The suicidal ideation is a very important stage as predictive factor to approach the completed suicide and refers to the thoughts regarding one's own death, which may or not be verbolized.
   There is little research about this subject mailer particularly in regards to population under 14; hence, in this study, psychological factors of a sample comprised by boys and girls between 10 and 12 from public and private schools from the State of Sonora will be analyzed and compared to identify those children associated with suicidal ideation and advance in the understanding of this complex phenomenon.
   Material and methods
   The study was descriptive-comparative, observational, and transversal in nature. Sample .631 elementary school fifth and sixth grader students, both genders, aged between 10 to 13 years, from 16 public schools and four private schools in Hermosillo, Sonora. A 631 student sample was considered through clusters connecting the entire schools within the city and the number of students enrolled in the school term. Instruments: A self applied form questionnaire, which evaluates socio-demographic data, was used with the following scales; Children's Depression Inventory CDI; Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale CMAS-R (revised); Self Esteem Inventory. Procedure: In order to carry out this research, authorization was requested to the Ministry of Education of Sonora. In a first phase during an academic hour, a self-applied form questionnaire with socio-demographic information and the depression scale was given Subsequently, the second part of the questionnaire was given to a sub-sample of two equal groups, one of them identified with suicidal ideation and the other one without ideation. Data analysis The statistical analyses were performed using the program SPSS version 15.0 Non-parametric test chi(2) (Chi Square) and prevalence ratio (odds ratio) were used.
   Results
   A total of 631 boys and girls were evaluated with the depression questionnaire during the first phase. The mean age was 10.9 years (range. 10-13 years), the gander variable was distributed 50.8% girls and 49.2% boys, as a result of the registration rate for fifth and sixth grades of elementary education; 72.1% of the children were in public schools and 27.9% in private schools. In accordance to answers of CDI item 9, children who marked these two possible answers. "You think in killing yourself but you believe you won't do it" (18.%) and "You have sometimes seriously thought about killing yourself" (11.1%) were considered with suicidal ideation This scale evaluated how the children fell during the two weeks previous to taking the questionnaire and 29.2% of the children somehow showed suicidal ideas The sub-sample defined from the total population was distributed into two groups one control group with 184 children without suicidal ideation and another group with 184 children with suicidal ideation.
   Depression: In regard to depression, results showed that group with suicidal ideation presented greater depressive states compared to the group without suicidal ideation (p<0.03, chi(2)= 65.66, gl=2), the highest percentage is located in moderate depression (40.7% and 22.8% respectively) Gender differences were shown only in the group of children without ideation becoming more frequent in boys (p<0.03, chi(2)=6.92, gl=2) While analyzing with the prevalence rate, it was found that children who show severe depression have an 3 8 higher risk of having suicidal ideation when compared with the group of children presenting this level of depression, but not expressing suicidal ideation (CI: 3.85-20.15).
   Self-esteem: The group with suicidal ideation showed 52.9% low self-esteem cases a statistically significant difference (p<0.00, chi(2)=32.31, gl=2) compared to the qroup of children with no ideation that presented a 3.1% of it Gender differences were not found in those groups. Boys and girls who show low self-esteem level have 3.7 more risk to present suicidal ideation compared with the group of children who have better self-esteem (CI: 2.3-5.9).
   Anxiety: Of the children with.-suicidal ideation, 37.7% showed a high anxiety leve. compared to the 18.4% presented by the children without ideation There were no differences between boys and girls. Showing anxiety indicates a 2 6 times higher risk to present suicide ideas (CI: 1.60-4.32).
   Discussion
   Although suicidal relation was present in school children population in a very significant way, it is considered low risk for this type of behavior. Depression appeared like the risk factor mostly associated with suicidal ideation Boys showed more depression compared to girls, on the other hand, most studies conducted with adolescents reported that before 12 years old it is likely not to find significant differences between genders perhaps by the gender issues, the biological, hormonal and society characteristics. This important to point out that some cases of children without depression presenting suicidal ideation were found, this information was supported by other studies. Although depression is an important risk factor, its presence is not essential for the suicidal ideation to be evident Low self-esteem is more evident as a higher. risk factor than anxiety for the presence Of Suicidal ideal-on No significant differences by gender were found Entering into the subject matter with population under four teen is difficult not only because the parents' limitations to talk about it, but because of the care it Must bp taken while working with mirrors The access a carry out this kind of research within the private school population is difficult; hence the existing little information about it. As a result of the lack of information, it becomes necessary to put it into execution under a strict methodology and according to the professional ethics in such in way that differences between children with and without suicidal ideation could be identified. Suicide is a multi-factorial character dynamic process and not only a single and changeless event, therefore, it is necessary to study how suicidal ideas are conceived and what context surrounds them from the earliest age. It is recommended to detect of a younger age the process loading to suicidal behavior and factors related to it.

AB Mental health frames and policies to enforce them cannot be excluded from the social context, neither the population's health conditions or the international tendencies. Their strategic place depends on the role the), play in the global milieu, and on the benefits derived from what is clone in terms of prevention and attention within the field.
   Psychiatric epidemiology serves as a tool for knowing mental disorders distribution, the risk factors implied in their etiology and evolution, as well as the elements influencing their detection and treatment. But psychiatric epidemiology has remained behind other branches of epidemiology given the problems for conceptualizing and measuring mental disorders. Thus, most of the work has been basically descriptive.
   Nevertheless it has been possible to move forward through historical series, analyses of community diagnosis, health services evaluation, risk measurement, description of clinical frames, identification of new syndromes and its related causes, and in carrying out national and international representative surveys in general population.
   This paper has four objectives: 1. to present an overview of the work done in epidemiologic psychiatry in Mexico for the lost 30 years; 2. to analyze the main areas explored; 3. to identify the most used designs; and 4. to enumerate the populations studied.
   Method. Articles about different aspects related to stud), and analysis of psychiatric epidemiology in Mexico were collected, including those reporting empirical results. The search was performed in a bibliographic database consulted in the Centro de Informacion en Salud Mental y Adicciones (CISMAD), located at the Instituto Nacional de Psiquiatria Ramon de la Fuente. Approximately 158 papers published in national and international journals were reviewed.
   Results. In the 1970's, work was aimed towards historical analysis seeking to provide an epidemiologic view of psychiatric disorders in Mexico. Interest was set on aspects related to attention of mental patients, the teaching of psychiatry, and in the advance of psychiatric knowledge. Some studies were done to have a look at the frequency and characteristics of certain diseases in unexplored populations.
   During the 1980's there was a renewed interest in dissecting the status of epidemiologic psychiatry and mental health, together with an intention to state its role in the future. Cross sectional studies were performed to know the prevalence of different mental illnesses in medical care. Validity and reliability of several detection and diagnosis instruments were evaluated, and some essays about the importance of having a clear view of attention needs and demands were carried out.
   At the beginning of the 1990's there were descriptive studies in rural and urban populations to describe the main elements determining the use of health services and the quest patterns for different attention options. New diagnosis instruments were used in subjects attending the first and second levels of care. Research on schizophrenia began with reviews and dissertations about its status in Mexico and other countries. Results of the Mental Health National Survey showing prevalence in general population were made public. Home base surveys made possible to know the scope of mental illness in children, adolescents, and adults. The use of epidemiology in child psychiatry allowed the inclusion of developmental psychopathology in the analysis of the interaction and interdependence of biological, psychological, and social variables.
   The 21st century set the emergence of the first longitudinal reports on suicide. Work continues on the prevalence of mental illness and new approaches on risk factors are added. Research on the frequency of disorders from well-defined diagnosis criteria is signed. Use and abuse of substances, and violence against women are studied to know their effects on mental health.
   The Survey on Psychiatric Morbidity was planned and conducted with great methodological rigor, and thus it was included in the first generation of ICPE studies, which has enabled data comparison on an international basis. Results have shown that depressive disorders are the most recurrent, whereas disorders related to substance abuse and dependence affect basically men, and that anxiety disorders are the most chronic.
   In 2000, the World Health Organization launched art initiative to make national epidemiologic studies in different countries, and Mexico was the first Latin American country to participate. The National Psychiatric Epidemiology Survey initial results have confirmed that the prevalence of disorders along fife is 28.6%, and that annual prevalence is 14%.
   Discussion. It is important to underline the need to pay attention to mental health problems from a preventive approach. In this respect, Mexico is a little behind and it is urgent to grow according to the advances, instruments, and techniques used in other countries.
   It is also important to acknowledge the work done so far; in this sense, the development of national surveys accounts for it. General population studies allow for the generation of an overview of the needs and the basic issues to create preventive interventions.
   Mexican epidemiologic psychiatry is in a developmental stage, stressed by the use of standardized diagnosis criteria to get comparable data (both from Mexico and other Countries in the world). However, the study designs employed until now do not allow for the exploration of the temporary evolution of disorders and related factors to be more exhaustive. Besides, there are limitations in evaluating health services, which could be overcome through cost-effectiveness analyses.
   In the national context it is notorious the lack of inquiring about the diagnosis boundaries, which should be one of the main directions of psychiatric epidemiology in the next years. This would be highly relevant taking into account that Mexico is a transition country that accepts and uses both European and American criteria.
   It should be mentioned also that, although Mexico has the same kind of problems than other countries, research has shown they are smaller, which makes studies on protective and risk factors a priority for the future.
   There are still certain aspects of epidemiology which remain practically untouched in research. For instance, it is important to focus on rural areas, on migrant populations, and on native groups to overcome the existing backwardness.
   Another important topic in the prevention area is the work to do carried out with mental problems during childhood and adolescence. Longitudinal studies would mark the path to evaluate different types of factors: genetic, biologic, familiar, psychodynamic, social, and economic. It is also important to analyze the interaction among them to know its impact on etiology and on the development of psychopathology during life.

SO NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS

DT Article
DE Moctezuma death; head injury; sling
AB This article analyzes the head injury of Emperor Moctezuma as one of those injuries that affected the course of history. The Emperor's death arguably changed the fate of an entire nation and led to the destruction of the Aztec civilization.
   Moctezuma died in the evening hours of June 30, 1520, in his palace in the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, while a prisoner of the Spanish conquistadors. The Emperor had been speaking to his people in an effort to persuade them to cease hostilities against Hernan Cortes, his Spanish soldiers, and Indian allies. Both Spanish and Indian contemporary sources document that he sustained a severe head injury when one of his own warriors hit him with a rock thrown from a sling. However, after the Conquest of Mexico some of the information collected by Spanish friars from Indian stories, songs, and pictorial representations raised the possibility that Moctezuma died of strangulation or stabbing at the hands of the Spaniards. There is even a suggestion of suicide. This issue remains unresolved and emotionally charged.
   The historical and clinical analysis of the events surrounding Moctezuma's death indicates that the Emperor most likely died as a consequence of head injury. The author has attempted to present a neutral analysis but agrees with Benjamin Keen that neutrality may be unattainable, no matter how remote the subject of historical inquiry is from the present.

AB Introduction: Suicide is an important public health problem and one of the most common causes of death throughout the world. Suicidal behaviour is complex, and its causes are multifactorial. Case-control studies have reported an association between an alteration of the serotonin system and suicidal behaviour. Recently, it has been suggested that the 5-HTRC2 serotonin receptor gene is involved in the pathogenesis of suicidal behaviour.
   Methods and analysis: To evaluate the role of the 5-HTR2C gene in suicidal behaviour, we will perform a systematic review and a meta-analysis of worldwide reports that have investigated the association between the serotonin system and suicidal behaviour. This analysis will be reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. Studies deemed fit for inclusion in the systematic review will be scored for methodological quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Assessment Scale (NOS). The inclusion criteria will be to present independent data, to be case-control studies and to be published in journal peer reviews. To generate more accurate analyses, we will grade the reports using the GRADES scale procedures.
   Ethics and dissemination: This study will describe the association between the HTR2C gene and suicidal behaviour. The results will be reported in a peer-reviewed publication and in scientific presentations in Mexico and throughout the world.

TI Student survery of Mexico City 2006. Prevalence and trends of drug use
SO SALUD MENTAL
LA Spanish
DT Article
DE Student surveys; adolescents; drug use; prevention; addiction diagnosis
ID RELIABILITY
AB Since three years from now, in Mexico there has been several surveys and specific research regarding drug use, Over these years the national surveillance systems databases (SISVEA, CIJ) have shown that cocaine use has stabilized and marijuana use is still increasing, although there are some regional differences. Also, the results of the 2003 Mexico City Students' Survey revealed a similar inclination: an increase on marijuana use, a slight diminish on cocaine use and as a new stage: a rebound on inhalant use. However, these changes and trends on drug use are not the same all over the country.
   The results found in these databases suggest that the northern border behaves differently from the rest of the country, even all along the northern border itself. While drug use in Matamoros is lower than in other border cities, Nuevo Laredo, Reynosa and Ciudad Juarez registered high cocaine and heroin use.
   On the other hand, even though the border cities of Sonora and Baja California have these some drug use problems, they also show high rates of methamphelamine use. Another important issue on border cities is that Ciudad Juarez has reached Tijuana's use levels, mainly among teens between 12 and 17 years old. These two cities have the highest substance use levels in the country, even above Mexico City.
   On the central region of the country, the drug use rates are halfway between. Even though Mexico City's drug use levels are among the central region and the two border cities mentioned before, in all the states that have been studied, there's been a general significant increase in drug use.
   In southern states, especially Yucatan (where there's a household and a students' survey), the drug rates are the lowest in the country. However, the women's drug use rates keeps increasing. Specifically the 2003 students' survey showed that in some Mexico City's counties women have higher alcohol and tobacco prevalence, and their illegal drug use trends begin to be alike to men's illegal drug use trends.
   Objective
   To present drug use prevalence results from the 2006 Mexico City Students Survey.
   Material and methods
   This survey used a 10523 Mexico City students random sample. The sample design was stratified (by county), with two stages (by school) and clustered (by groups).
   This data is representative by State County and by educational level. The design is comparable with previous student's surveys made by the National Psychiatric Institute (INP) and the Mexican Board of Education (SEP).
   The marijuana, cocaine and inhalants variation coefficients (VC) were determined according to the 2003 survey. The variable with the highest VC, a non-response rate and a design effect of two were considered as in previous surveys. With oil these parameters, it was considered a 15% non-response rate, the some found in previous studies. The sample's accuracy level was 95%, with an absolute error average of 0.004.
   The questionnaire was made with drug use indicators that the World Health Organization used in their own surveys. Besides, some youth behaviors were explored: suicide attempt, depression, eating risk behaviors, sexual behavior, etc.
   Results
   From this sample 49.9% were women and 50.5% male. As for Tobacco "Ever use", it affected the same both men and women, and remained similar in comparison to 2003.
   Also, 68.8% of the adolescents have consumed alcohol of least once in their life and 41.3% has drunk it in the previous month, being women and men equally behaved. The total drug use prevalence was 17.8%, statistically higher than in the 2003 survey, with a 2.6% difference. Men use more drugs compared to women.
   Of the total sample, 12.9% is an experimental user and 4.9% is a regular user (have used drugs five or more times).
   As for medical drugs (tranquillizers and amphetamines), their use is higher in women, while illegal drugs use (marijuana, cocaine, hallucinogens, inhalants, methamphetamine and heroin) is higher in men. In general terms, illegal drug use is higher than medical drugs use. Substance use percentage was nearly twice for tenth to twelfth grade students, compared to seventh to ninth grade students.
   Women have experimented less with illegal drugs in the 'previous year of use' than men, yet women have shown an important increase on inhalant and marijuana use over the past three years, and cocaine use has remained similar.
   Marijuana is the first choice drug among adolescents, followed by inhalants, tranquillizers in third place and cocaine in fourth place of choice.
   Also, the results show that drug use is highly related with other problematic behaviors like suicidal attempt, depressive sintomatology, antisocial behavior, and sexual risk behaviors.
   Conclusions
   The study points out an important increase in drug use over the past three years, going from 15.2% to 17.8%. Different trends can be seen on each substance. On the one hand, marijuana and inhalants use has increased widely, on the other hand tranquillizers use remains stable and cocaine use has decreased. These results showed that the illegal drugs use among both men and women has increased (marijuana and inhalants mostly), women's cocaine use has remained steady, but men's has been reduced.
   Legal drugs use behavior hasn't changed: the use of alcohol has enhanced, while tobacco use is similar to the 2003 survey. It has also been reported that the use rate of both substances is practically the same among men and women.
   Also, the situation of Mexico City has changed slightly. The counties that are more damaged by drug use are: Azcapotzalco, Cuauhtemoc, Benito Juarez, Coyoacan and Tlalpon. In order to improve drug use prevention programs to consider the relationship between several problematic behaviors like suicidal attempt or antisocial behavior, because users showed prevalence at least twice more than non users.
   Likewise, there still exist a low risk perception and a high tolerance towards tobacco and alcohol use, which are important risk factors for using other drugs. Additionally, if we also take into account that the first use takes place a younger age, the probabilities of using medical and illegal drugs increase significantly.

TI Non-Suicidal Self-Injury among Adult Males in a Correctional Setting
SO ISSUES IN MENTAL HEALTH NURSING

DT Article
ID MUTILATION; HARM; BEHAVIOR; SUICIDE
AB Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) was thought to be a predominantly female malady and adult males who engage in NSSI in a correctional setting have not yet been well-researched. This study is, therefore, one of a few that explores the phenomenon of NSSI among males who engage in this behavior in a correctional setting. The purpose of this article is to present the demographic and motivational factors of adult males who engage in NSSI in a correctional setting. The sample consisted of 42 adult males incarcerated in three New Mexico Prisons who had a history of NSSI. Of the participants, 40% were Hispanic and 60% were non-Hispanic. Three measures were used in this study: the Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory (DSHI), the Self-Injury Motivational Scale-II (SIMS-II), and a researcher-created demographic questionnaire. The DSHI was used to examine the types of self-harm, as well as the frequency, severity, and duration of each behavior. The SIMS-II explored 36 potential types of motivations or reasons for self-injurious behavior.
   Fifteen of the 16 forms of NSSI were endorsed by at least one of the participants. The most predominant type of NSSI reported was cutting (93%), followed by head banging (78%), and sticking oneself with sharp objects (71.4%). Ninety-three percent of the participants required medical attention or hospitalization due to NSSI behaviors. Motivational factors associated with cutting were predominantly mood dysregulation, communication, and addictive qualities.

AB Background: A growing group of emerging adults in many countries around the globe are not incorporated into the education system or the labor market; these have received the label "NEET: not in education, employment nor training". We describe the mental health and socio-demographic characteristics of emerging adults who are NEET from Mexico City (differentiating between NEET who are homemakers and NEET who are not) compared to their peers who are studying, working or both, in a city in which education and employment opportunities for youth are limited. A secondary objective, because of the often inconsistent inclusion criteria or definitions of NEET, was to evaluate the heterogeneity amongst NEET emerging adults in terms of their perceived reasons for being NEET and to evaluate whether different reasons for being NEET are associated with different mental health characteristics.
   Methods: The participants were 1071 emerging adults aged 19 to 26; they were interviewed in person by an interviewer in their homes as part of a follow-up study of the Mexican Adolescent Mental Health Survey. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI) assessed psychiatric disorders, substance use and abuse, suicidal behavior and socio-demographic characteristics.
   Results: Of the total sample, 15.3% were NEET homemakers, 8.6% NEET non-homemakers, 41.6% worked only, 20.9% studied only and 13.5% worked and studied. Of those who were NEET, 12.6% were NEET by choice. NEET non-homemakers had overall greater odds of substance use, substance use disorders and some suicidal behaviors in comparison with all their peers, whereas NEET homemakers had reduced odds. Those who were NEET because they didn't know what to do with their life had greater odds of mood, behavioral, and substance disorders, use of all substances and of suicide behaviors compared to those who were NEET by choice.
   Conclusions: Non-homemaker NEET who lack life goals require targeted mental health intervention. The demographic reality of emerging adults not in education or employment and the varying reasons they give for being NEET are not consistent with how NEET is often conceptualized in terms of a societal problem.

AB Objective: In Mexico, specialized treatment services for people with co-occurring disorders are limited within public health services, while private options are deemed too costly. More than 2,000 community-based residential care facilities have risen as an alternative and are the main source of treatment for individuals with substance use disorders; however, suboptimal practices within such facilities are common. Information on the clinical characteristics of patients receiving care in these facilities is scarce and capacity to provide high-quality care for co-occurring disorders is unknown. The aims of this study were to examine the prevalence of co-occurring disorders in patients receiving treatment for substance use in these community-based residential centers and to assess whether the presence of co-occurring disorders is associated with higher severity of substance use, psychiatric symptomatology, and other health risks. Methods: This study was conducted with 601 patients receiving treatment for substance use disorders at 30 facilities located in five Mexican states, recruited in 2013 and 2014. Patients were assessed with self-report measures on substance use, service utilization, suicidality, HIV risk behaviors, psychiatric symptomatology, and psychiatric disorder diagnostic criteria. Results: The prevalence of any co-occurring disorder in this sample was 62.6%. Antisocial personality disorder was the most prevalent (43.8%), followed by major depressive disorder (30.9%). The presence of a co-occurring disorder was associated with higher severity of psychiatric symptoms (aB = .496, SE = .050, p < .05); more days of substance use (aB = .219, SE = .019, p < .05); current suicidal ideation (aOR = 5.07, 95% CI [2.58, 11.17]; p < .05), plans (aOR = 5.17 95% CI [2.44, 12.73]; p < .05), and attempts (aOR = 6.43 95% CI [1.83, 40.78]; p < .05); more sexual risk behaviors; and more contact with professional services (aOR = 1.77, 95% CI [1.26, 2.49], p < .05). Conclusions: Co-occurring disorders are highly prevalent in community-based residential centers in Mexico and are associated with significantly increased probability of other health risks. This highlights the need to develop care standards for this population and the importance of clinical research in these settings.

AB Objectives Comorbidity is a common feature of mental disorders. However, needs assessment surveys focus largely on individual disorders rather than on comorbidity even though the latter is more important for predicting suicidal thoughts and behaviors. In the current report, we take a step beyond this conventional approach by presenting data on the prevalence and correlates (sociodemographic factors, college-related factors, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors) of the main multivariate profiles of common comorbid Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV disorders among students participating in the first phase of the World Health Organization World Mental Health International College Student initiative. Method A web-based mental health survey was administered to first year students in 19 colleges across eight countries (Australia, Belgium, Germany, Mexico, Northern Ireland, South Africa, Spain, United States; 45.5% pooled response rate) to screen for seven common DSM-IV mental disorders: major depression, mania/hypomania, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, alcohol use disorder, and drug use disorder. We focus on the 14,348 respondents who provided complete data; 38.4% screened positive for at least one 12-month disorder. Results Multivariate disorder profiles were detected using latent class analysis (LCA). The least common class (C1; 1.9% of students) was made up of students with high comorbidity (four or more disorders, the majority including mania/hypomania). The remaining 12-month cases had profiles of internalizing-externalizing comorbidity (C2; 5.8%), internalizing comorbidity (C3; 14.6%), and pure disorders (C4; 16.1%). The 1.9% of students in C1 had much higher prevalence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors than other students. Specifically, 15.4% of students in C1 made a suicide attempt in the 12 months before the survey compared with 1.3-2.6% of students with disorders in C2-4, 0.2% of students with lifetime disorders but no 12-month disorders (C5), and 0.1% of students with no lifetime disorders (C6). Conclusions In line with prior research, comorbid mental disorders were common; however, sociodemographic correlates of LCA profiles were modest. The high level of comorbidity underscores the need to develop and test transdiagnostic approaches for treatment in college students.

AB Introduction
   Depression has been frequently related with suicidal behavior. Evidences of depressive symptoms in adolescents and young people with suicidal ideation or suicidal intention have been showed in severa. studies. For that reason, it is necessary to have an adequate instrument to measure and identify some characteristics associated with self-destructive behavior in university students.
   Objective
   To evaluate the psychometric properties of CES-D/IS in students at the University Juarez of the State of Durango (UJED).
   Material and Methods
   The universe of study selected for the schooling period of 2008 consisted of 943 students from 13 academic units. CES-D/IS scale was applied. Before the interview informed consent was obtained from all the participants and they were informed about the nature and scope of the study. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to evaluate the instrument validity, and Cronbach alpha for internal consistency. Further analysis included Student t-test and Mann-Withney U test. A p. value below 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. The data were analyzed with SPSS, version 15 and R v 2.7.2.
   Results
   The total scale showed a high value of internal consistency (alpha=0.89), and similar results for academic areas, for age and sex. Factor analysis showed a four-factor structure that accounted for 45.5% of variance.
   Conclusions
   CES-D/IS scale has adequate psychometric properties in reliability and in validity.

AB Purpose. To test in two groups of physicians-in-training a simplified questionnaire exploring their acceptance of Physician Assisted Death (PAD), Therapy Withdrawal upon family request (WD), and Personalized PAD (PPAD) on whether the participant would seek PAD for him/herself. Material and methods. A 4-item questionnaire was answered by 212 residents in different stages of training and grouped as beginners (1st and 3d year internal medicine residents, n = 76) and advanced (5th to 8th year residents of different internal medicine or oncology subspecialties, n = 136). The response options to the PAD and WD questions included a conditioned yes (C-Yes) dealing with legalization of PAD or the existence of a patient's previous written agreement to WD. Results. Beginners had significantly more Yes plus C-Yes answers than advanced for questions regarding PAD (82 vs. 55%), WD (95 vs. 75%) and PPAD (76 vs. 56%). The importance of legal aspects implied in the conditioned answers can be seen in two findings: a) A sizable 29% of participants conditioned their Yes answers for both questions whereas only 9% gave an unconditioned Yes to both. b) A cross-classification of the PAD and WD answers showed that 13% of participants reversed their No in PAD to C-Yes in WD. Conclusions. Our simplified questionnaire operated well and was able to confirm the increase in acceptance of PAD and WD by young Mexican physicians, and the need of legislation regarding end of life decisions in our country.

AB Background
   Early onset mania (MIMT), compared with adolescent onset mania (MIA), has a different clinical presentation of classic mania adult onset (MIEA). Patients with MIA have a course more like the MIEA. Externalizing disorders (ADHD, ODD, and TC) have been associated with an earlier age of onset of bipolar disorder and as a marker of poor prognosis. Our goal is to determine the frequency of symptoms related to disruptive behavior disorders in patients with bipolar disorder start very early, early and adult evaluated retrospectively.
   Methods
   The total sample (N=64) of adolescent and adult patients was obtained from the National Institute of Psychiatry (INPRF) clinics. The diagnosis was confirmed by the research team. Patients signed the informed asentment and consentment. We applied the K SADS PL Mexico, MINI and MINI KID. We used the EEPE-AA for externalizing disorders.
   Results
   There were significant differences in scores compared by EEPE AA EIED groups in the Inattention subscale for GIMT. The presence of ADHD, ODD, TC and Suicide Risk in the time of evaluation was significantly associated with an earlier onset.
   Discussion and conclusion
   Our data supports the clinical utility and importance of separating the TBP by age of onset. The detection of externalizing disorders may speak of an early onset of the disorder and may also have implications for prognosis and psychopharmacological treatment, since the TBP-onset childhood to adulthood remains similar and difficult to manage. This suggests that we must have a longitudinal view of this disorder.

TI Hazardous and harmful drinking among Mexican adolescents: prevalence and
   predictive factors
SO SALUD MENTAL
LA Spanish
DT Article
DE Alcoholism; alcohol; AUDIT; hazardous drinking; harmful drinking;
   adolescent drinking; Mexico; Latin America
ID DISORDERS IDENTIFICATION TEST; ALCOHOL; EMERGENCY; AUDIT
AB Background
   Alcohol is commonly used among adolescents in Mexico. In a representative survey of Mexico's general population, 30% of the teenagers reported current drinking, whereas 8% incurred in binge drinking (5 or more drinks per occasion) at least once during the lost year. In addition, 3% reported three at more alcohol dependence symptoms over the lost 12 months.
   In this Mexican age group, alcohol consumption importantly contributes to the most frequent causes of morbidity and mortality (e.g. accidents, violence, homicides, suicide and risky behaviors).
   Data from a representative survey of adolescents attending middle and high school in Mexico City suggests that adolescents attending Mexico's schools run a high risk for alcohol problems In this study, prevalence of lifetime and current drinking, and of current binge drinking (5 or more drinks per occasion) were, respectively, 65.8%, 35.2%, and 23.8% These rates are substantially higher than those described in teenagers from Mexico's general population. Furthermore, although among Mexico's general population the prevalence of drinking has traditionally been higher among male than female adolescents, no gender differences in prevalence of alcohol consumption have been reported among Mexican middle and high school students. This suggests that female adolescents in Mexico's schools have become equally exposed to drinking as their male counterparts.
   Despite these trends, there is a paucity of studies examining drinking patterns and their respective correlates among Mexican adolescents attending post-elementary education. To our knowledge, in this population, there are no published prevalence estimates of Hazardous and Harmful Drinking (HHD). HHD is defined as a pattern of alcohol consumption conferring to the individual a greater risk for health problems, or frankly conducive to medical or psychological complications (e.g. accidents, victimization, violence, alcohol dependence, liver cirrhosis and/or other medical complications).
   The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), developed by the World Health Organization, is currently the only instrument specifically designed to identify HHD. Although the AUDIT was initially validated only among adult patients in primary care settings, this instrument has consistently shown to be valid and reliable in detecting alcohol problems in different populations, such as the adolescent population in many countries around the world.
   Given the public health implications of estimating the frequency of HHD among adolescents attending high school in Mexico, and given the importance of elucidating the variables influencing this problem, we decided to conduct the analysis presented here lo our knowledge, this is the first report published in the international literature on the prevalence of HHD among adolescents attending high school in a Latin American country.
   Objective
   In the study described here, derived from a Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) project entitled "Early Identification and Treatment of Problem Drinkers", we aimed at examining the frequency and risk factors for HHD among Mexican high school students. More specifically, our objectives were. 1. to determine the post-year prevalence of HHD among high school freshmen, and 2 to examine, in this population, the effects of demographic and family variables in the likelihood of HHD.
   Subjects and methods
   This study was a cross-sectional survey conducted of the beginning of the school year during the registration period between September 1st and September 30th, 2005. In 2005, a total of 34000 students were accepted to innate college of the nine UNAM college campuses located in the Mexico City metropolitan area Of these, 28784 students (87.4 %) (age= 14.8 [+/- 2.5] years; 51.0% women) consented in answering the survey and provided complete data. Consequently, 5216 students (12.6%) were excluded from the analysis due to a lack of consent, incomplete data or their absence at the time of registration.
   We used the AUDIT to examine post-year prevalence of HHD This self-report instrument includes 10 items that examine frequency and intensity of drinking (items 1-3), presence of alcohol dependence symptoms (items 4-6), and negative consequences of drinking (items 7-10), yielding a maximum possible score of 40 points. Among adult patients in primary care settings, it has been accepted that an AUDIT score of 0-7 points reflects safe levels of alcohol consumption, whereas a score of 8 points or higher indicates the presence of Hazardous and/or Harmful Drinking. It has been described however, that among adolescents, on AUDIT score of 3 points or higher reliably identifies those students experiencing this problem.
   In the analysis presented here, we separately examined and reported prevalence estimates and correlates for I HID using both AUDIT's cut-off scores (>= 3 and >= 8).
   The AUDIT was administered at the some time that a wellness Screening survey that, the UNAM Medical Services routinely administer to all registering high school freshman at the beginning of the school year. Questions in the wellness survey pertained students' medical and dental health, family medical history, immunizations, and use of tobacco and other drugs.
   In addition, demographic and socioeconomic information was obtained from a questionnaire also routinely administered by the UNAM registrar's office. This questionnaire included 37 inquiring about gender, age, employment and marital status, monthly family income, parental education, place and type of residency, persons with whom the student resided, and questions on previous academic performance.
   We estimated the prevalence a; HHD and their respective 95% confidence intervals (95% Cl) in the total of the sample, and separately by age group, gender, working status, monthly family income, parental education, and by variables reflecting whether the students lived with their family.. peers, or alone, These variables were modeled using simulated binary terms (0, 1) Subsequently, a multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between HHD and the demographic and socioeconomic variables listed above. Variables were entered simultaneously into the logistic regression equation To summarize the level of risk of HHD conferred by significant variables in the logistic regression model, odds ratios (OR) and their respective 95% CI's were estimated. All the significant effects reported here were adjusted considering the effects of the remaining demographic and socioeconomic variables.
   Results
   Among the high school students examined here, the prevalence of HHD was 4.0% when an AUDIT cut-off score of >= 8 was used. When an AUDIT score of >= 3 was considered, a frequency of 17.2% was observed. Men (AUDIT>8.5 4%; AUDIT >= 3 21.4%) experienced this problem more frequently than women (AUDIT >= 8 2 6%; AUDIT >= 3: 13.1%). The highest prevalence of HHD among men was observed in all age groups and regardless of working status, family income, parents' education, or regardless of the persons with whom the student reported to live with. Controlling for demographic and socioeconomic differences between men and women, we found that the risk of experiencing HHD among men was approximately two times higher than among women (OR's and 95% C1's for AUDIT's cut-off score :8 or >= 3, respectively 2.0[1.6-2.4] and 1.6[1.5-1.8]).
   In both, men and woman, the frequency and risk of HHD correlated positively with age. Thus, older students experienced the highest risk of HHD.
   Among those students who reported to work to support themselves, there was a greater frequency and likelihood of HHD. In men, this risk increased with the number of weekly working hours, whereas in women this lost effect was seen unequivocally only when an AUDIT cut-off score of 3 was used.
   Also, a higher monthly family income was associated with a higher chance of HHD. Men in the highest family income group (10 or more minimum salaries) tend to experience the highest risk for this problem, while women in ore of the lowest income groups experienced the lowest risk.
   Although we did not find any effects of the number of years of parental education on the likelihood of HHD separately in men or women, in the total sample, there was a greater risk of HHD among those students having a father with 7-12 years of education.
   Regarding protective factors, among those students who reported to be financially supported by their parents, there was a non-significant trend (p=0.15) toward a lower risk of HHD when on AUDIT's cut-off score of 8 was used. The protective effect of this variable was significantly evident when an AUDIT's cut-off score of 3 was used, particularly among women.
   Finally, in our sample there were no effects on the likelihood of HHD from variables reflecting whether the students lived with family, peers, or alone.
   Conclusions
   HHD is not an uncommon problem among Mexican adolescents In this sample, predictors for on. increased risk of this problem may reflect the effects of variables facilitating teenagers' access to alcoholic beverages and exposure to high-risk activities. These findings have direct implications in designing preventive and treatment interventions addressing alcohol problems among Mexican adolescents in Mexico

AB Introduction: Mexico City enters this century as one of the most populated cities in the world, where difficulties in living together multiply and become deeper, and living conditions have greatly deteriorated. Also, poverty has become more severe and this creates an environment where different expressions of violence propagate.
   From the health perspective, the topic of violence as a public health problem is relatively recent and has led some international organizations to call attention to the social and economic cost and to the overload which injuries caused by violence are producing in the already saturated health systems.
   Objective: To identify the causes for the demand of attention at the emergency health care of public hospitals in Mexico City due to intentional injuries produced by different types of violent acts.
   Methods: A cross-sectional design was used, where the observational and analytical units were those individuals whodue to intentional injuries demanded medical care at the hospital emergency services located in different areas of Mexico City.
   Information was obtained through a questionnaire applied to individuals who had been intentionally injured, and collected by previously trained interviewers who covered the 24 hours of the day during the study period. The studied variables of the injured individuals were: age, sex, scholastic level, activity, alcohol intake before the event, pre-hospital care, type of injury and external cause, categorized according to the International Diseases Classification, as well as to the injury severity.
   With respect to perpetrators, we were only able to obtain information on the relationship between the perpetrator and the injured, and the motivations. Based on this information, we categorized the type of violence as follows: a) Assault or robbery: when the injury was caused by strangers with the intention of stealing independently of the Site of the event; b) Interpersonal violence: when the injury was caused by strangers or individuals known by the injured, at sites outside the home; c) Domestic violence: when the injury was inflicted by spouses or relatives, independently of the site and the level of kinship; d) Self-inflicted injuries: suicides and suicidal attempts were included in this category.
   We carried out a descriptive analysis of data through calculations of simple frequencies fur each one of the variables. Later on, through the statistical chi square, the proportional differences between the variables included in the studs were Figured according to the type of violence. We used the Stata 5 statistical package.
   Results: The total number of the studied cases was 598, distributed as follows: 46% due to interpersonal violence, Followed by assaultive injuries, which amounted to 28.6% of the total sample. In both types of violence, males were significantly more affected (p <0.0001), as well as young people between ages 15 and 24. The public thoroughfare was the most frequent site of events. Domestic violence reached 19.6% of the total sample. Females between ages 25 and 34 were significantly more affected (p <0.0001), their sexual partner was the perpetrator and the home was the site of the event in most cases. It is important to mention that this was the most frequent type of violence in all females of the sample, and the cause of the injury in 67% of all treated cases in this group, while in men, this was the Cause in only, 7.6% of the cases. Self-inflicted injuries reached a lesser percentage, with only, 28 cases similarly-distributud among men and women; the home was the main situ of the event.
   Self-inflicted injuries in women were due to the use of some kind of medicament, while in half of the men cutting or piercing instruments were involved, and in the other half, poisonous substances. The type of violence which caused the greatest number of severe cases were intentional injuries in a FAIL, firearms, or cutting or piercing instruments. It is important to mention that in the self-inflicted injuries the external cause which provoke the greatest number of severe cases was poisoning by solid or liquid substances since 64%, of the total number of cases recorded in this category required hospitalization or died.

AB Objective: College entrance may be a strategically well-placed "point of capture" for detecting late adolescents with suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB). However, a clear epidemiological picture of STB among incoming college students is lacking. We present the first cross-national data on prevalence as well as socio-demographic and college-related correlates for STB among first-year college students.
   Method: Web-based self-report surveys were obtained from 13,984 first-year students (response rate 45.5%) across 19 colleges in 8 countries (Australia, Belgium, Germany, Mexico, Northern Ireland, South Africa, Spain, and the United States).
   Results: Lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts was 32.7%, 17.5%, and 4.3%, respectively. The 12-month prevalence was 17.2%, 8.8%, and 1.0%, respectively. About three-fourths of STB cases had onset before the age of 16 years (Q3 = 15.8), with persistence figures in the range of 41% to 53%. About one-half (53.4%) of lifetime ideators transitioned to a suicide plan; 22.1% of lifetime planners transitioned to an attempt. Attempts among lifetime ideators without plan were less frequent (3.1%). Significant correlates of lifetime STB were cross-nationally consistent and generally modest in effect size (median adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.7). Nonheterosexual orientation (aOR range 3.3-7.9) and heterosexual orientation with some same-sex attraction (aOR range 1.9-2.3) were the strongest correlates of STB, and of transitioning from ideation to plans and/or attempts (aOR range 1.6-6.1).
   Conclusion: The distribution of STB in first-year students is widespread, and relatively independent of socio-demographic risk profile. Multivariate risk algorithms based on a high number of risk factors are indicated to efficiently link high-risk status with effective preventive interventions.

AB Objective: To examine (1) the prevalence, types, and severity of child abuse and neglect (CAN) and (2) the relationship between CAN and lifetime psychiatric disorders among American Indian women using primary care services.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 234 American Indian women, age 18-45 who presented for outpatient ambulatory services at a community-based Indian Health Service Hospital in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Dependent measures included mood, substance abuse, and anxiety disorders as well as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as measured by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. CAN was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.
   Results: Approximately three-quarters of respondents (76.5%; 95% CI = 70.4, 81.7) reported some type of childhood abuse or neglect; over 40% reported exposure to severe maltreatment. Severity of child maltreatment was associated in a dose response manner with lifetime diagnosis of mental disorders. After adjusting for social and demographic correlates, severe child maltreatment was strongly associated with lifetime PTSD (prevalence ratio [PR] = 3.9; 95% CI = 1.9, 8.0); and was moderately associated with lifetime substance use disorders (PR = 2.3; 95% CI = 1.6, 3.3); mood disorders (PR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.4, 3.2); and with two or more disorders (PR = 2.3; 95% CI = 1.6, 3.4).
   Conclusion: CAN was common in our sample of American Indian women in primary care and was positively associated with lifetime psychiatric disorders outcomes. Screening for CAN and psychiatric disorders would enhance the treatment of patients seeking primary care services. Primary prevention of child maltreatment might reduce the high prevalence of mental disorders among American Indian women. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: This multicenter study estimated the prevalence of bipolar disorder (BPD) among emergency department (ED) patients in Latin America. Methods: To identify patients with BPD, a combination of DSM IV-criteria interview and the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) was used. Data from 1,505 patients from hospitals in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico was analyzed. Results: The prevalence of BPD in this sample was 5.2% (95% CI = 4.5% to 6.9%). Themean age was 37 years (response rate of 83.0%). Compared to non-BPD patients, BPD patients were more likely to report asthma (16.7% vs. 9%), thyroid problems (12.8% vs. 5.8%), seizures (23.1% vs. 3.0%), obesity (39.7% vs. 26.9%), alcohol abuse (30.8% vs. 10.0%), attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (50.0% vs. 12.0%), depression (81.6% vs. 45.7%), obsessive compulsive disorder (20.1% vs. 3.0%), panic disorders (23.1% vs. 12.3%), phobic disorders (11.2% vs. 3.1%), and any anxiety disorder (82.1% vs. 41.8%; all p <= 0.05). Suicidal plans and attempts were also significant higher in the bipolar group (11.5% vs. 2.8% and 10.3% vs. 1.8% respectively). Multivariate analysis identified ADHD, depression, alcohol abuse, anxiety disorder, and last month suicide plans and attempts to be independently associated with BPD. Conclusion: Our study supports that BPD is prevalent in ED in Latin-American countries and that comorbidity is the rule, not the exception. Patients presenting at ED with irritability, anxiety, pressure speech, euphoria, with suicidal tendencies, involved in risky behaviors, alcohol abuse, dependence or those with history of mental health hospitalization in the past 12 months must be assessed for comorbid BPD.

AB Objective: Meta-analyze all published epidemiologic studies reporting pediatric mania or bipolar disorder to investigate whether pediatric bipolar disorder is becoming more prevalent and whether rates vary significantly by country.
   Data Sources: Searches of PubMed and PsycInfo were conducted through the spring of 2010 using the following search terms: child, pediatric, young, adolescent, epidemiology, prevalence, bipolar, mania, suicide, and psychiatric. We also manually reviewed references in recent reviews of epidemiology of bipolar disorder.
   Study Selection: All studies reporting rates for mania or hypomania in community epidemiologic samples with participants up to 21 years of age.
   Data Extraction: All articles were coded to extract relevant variables. Prevalence rates were calculated from reported number of cases with bipolar disorders, then logit transformed. Twelve studies were included, enrolling 16,222 youths between the ages of 7 and 21 years during a period from 1985 to 2007. Six samples were from the United States; 6 were from other countries (the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Spain, Mexico, Ireland, and New Zealand).
   Results:The overall rate of bipolar disorder was 1.8% (95% CI, 1.1%-3.0%). There was no significant difference in the mean rates between US and non-US studies, but the US studies had a wider range of rates. The highest estimates came from studies that used broad definitions and included bipolar disorder not otherwise specified. Year of enrollment was negatively correlated with prevalence (r=-0.04) and remained nonsignificant when controlling for study methodological differences.
   Conclusions: Mean rates of bipolar disorder were higher than commonly acknowledged and not significantly different in US compared to non-US samples, nor was there evidence of an increase in rates of bipolar disorder in the community over time. Differences in diagnostic criteria were a main driver of different rates across studies. J Clin Psychiatry 2011;72(9):1250-1256 (C) Copyright 2011 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

ID METAANALYSIS; ANTIDEPRESSANTS
AB Introduction Depression is growing in importance every day. It is estimated that by the year 2020 it will be worldwide the second cause for the loss of healthy life years and the first in developed countries. Considering this, an adequate and opportune diagnosis will allow for a complete handling of the disorder. This should include adequate psychotherapy and medical treatment which will in turn improve significantly the prognosis and life quality of depressed individuals.
   In the primary care area, sub-diagnosis and delays to identify depression are common. These have a negative effect on the individuals' well-being, in public health and in the direct and indirect costs of health services. It is not uncommon for primary care practitioners to consider everyday complaints, the inability to cope with family stress, social isolation, role change and money problems as "causes" for depression. Thus, they deem depression "Justified" and fail to offer treatment when actually this very inability is often caused by depression.
   Depression is among the most frequent psycho-geriatric ailments. In Mexico, its overall prevalence is 9.5% in women and 5% in men age 60 or more. In most instances, it goes undiagnosed given its atypical expression or the false belief which considers it part of the normal aging process. In the elderly, depression may conceal somatic symptoms, be it as expressions of the depressive syndrome or because these same symptoms aggravate symptoms from other concomitant diseases. Secondary cognitive symptoms are more frequent among this age group.
   Objective
   To provide physicians at primary care a guideline with enough technical-medical elements to facilitate the timely diagnosis and integral treatment of elderly with depression.
   Method
   This study comprised two phases: design and validation of the guideline.
   Evidence selection
   1. Key words for search: depression, elderly, clinical guidelines, prevalence, primary care, assessment, treatment, suicide risk.
   2. Data bases used: Cochrane, Pub-Med and Medline for the 1990-2006 period.
   3. Twenty-six references for major depression in the elderly were found: eight random meta-analysis, two random clinical, one cohort, twelve descriptive non-experimental, and three book articles (DSM-IV[HRM1] TR; CIE 10, Psycho-geriatrics Manual).
   4. Evidence category and strength of recommendation. This indicates the user about the origin of recommendations issued.
   In the algorithm from the clinical guide, the concepts or support for each recommendation are identified. In this guide, the diagnosis of depression is based on the CIE-10 and its ranking may be comparable to that for major depression in the DSM-IV TR. Differential diagnosis; criteria for referring a patient to the psychiatrist ; guidelines for pharmacological, psychotherapeutic and psychosocial treatment; onset phase and maintenance phase are included.
   Thus, the clinical practice guide proposed is based on a strict methodology. It offers enough elements for the general practitioner to assess an opportune and complete treatment for elderly people with depression. In addition, it incorporates criteria based on scientific evidence, which will allow updating it, and evaluating its solidity in the face of new evidence, which will in turn maintain its validity.

DE Disobedience; dissidence; resilience; necessity; silence
AB We are disobedient. From the beginning, our natural tendency has gone against what we were imposed and taught, as it was a false necessity. Our will of not doing has been a dissidence, that was chosen by those who not only created but also revealed, studying the existent conditions, while highlighting the deceit of the prevailing programmed obedience.
   These realities have been threatened, ignored, silenced, and unknown so far, but this is the time to return to them, in order to claim an autonomy based upon the definition of the person and her/his exploration. It looks like we lost the ability to disobey our modified instincts, not even questioning the fact that we obey anymore; it looks like we forgot about the possibility to have a choice, doubting that we ought to doubt everything. Trained and limited by an absolute devotion towards business, we confuse the difference between means and aims, keeping us immersed in a world of blind obedience, where architecture stops being alive; it does not evolve anymore, nor it breathes or it takes decisions: it became a drained territory in continuous decline, a waiver that enriches the skepticism towards change and its relevancy. Nonetheless, it is possible to blur this suicide of architecture, exporting the design drives derived from arts and literature, and producing alternatives and additions to denial and exploration. Some among those who preferred not to do it, proved their capability to assert, to choose and to trigger changes in knowledge, endurance and criticism. These people [Carlos Mijares Bracho in Colima (Mexico); Ishigami Junya in the Venice Biennale of 2010, with People meet in Architecture; Lacaton & Vassal in the Leon Aucoc square in Burdeos; Toyo Ito with Pao para La chica nomada de Tokyo; Michael Rakowitz with ParaSITE homeless shelter, Hans Walter Willer with Iglesia nomada] have been searching for the way to escape, highlight and immerse themselves in an ideology that could build a society free from formats and that, making use of its own necessities, could start over from disobedience - intended as the beginning of a phase which is uprooted from the unnecessary, so to mantain a resilience in time, memory and creation.

AB Background and Aims: Infection with the parasite Toxoplasma gondii has been associated with bipolar disorder in several countries other than Mexico. Therefore, we sought to determine the association between seropositivity to T. gondii and bipolar disorder in a Mexican population. Methods: We performed an age- and gender-matched case-control study of 66 patients with bipolar disorder (WHO International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision code: F31) and 396 subjects without this disorder from the general population. Anti-Toxoplasma immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibodies were determined using commercially available enzyme-linked immunoassays. Results: Six (9.1%) of the 66 patients with bipolar disorder and 22 (5.6%) of the 396 controls had anti-T. gondii IgG antibodies (odds ratio [OR] = 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66-4.36; P = 0.26). Stratification by gender and age did not show a difference in seroprevalence between cases and controls. The frequency of high (> 150 international units/ml) anti-T. gondii IgG levels was similar in cases (n = 2) and in controls (n = 12) (OR = 1.0; 95% CI = 0.21-4.57; P = 1.00). Stratification by International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision F31 codes showed that patients with F31.3 code had a higher seroprevalence of T. gondii infection than their age- and gender-matched controls (OR = 16.4; 95% CI = 1.25-215.09; P = 0.04). None of the six anti-T. gondii IgG-seropositive patients with bipolar disorder and 4 (18.2%) of the 22 anti-T. gondii IgG-seropositive controls had anti-T. gondii IgM antibodies (P = 0.54). Conclusions: Our results suggest that T. gondii seropositivity is not associated with bipolar disorder in general. However, a specific type of bipolar disorder (F31.3) might be associated with T. gondii seropositivity. Further research to elucidate the role of T. gondii infection in bipolar disorder is needed.

AB Background Unsafe storage of unused medications at home leads to an increased risk of toxicity, accidental childhood poisoning or risk for suicide, whereas an improper disposal of unwanted/expired medications from household raises concern about environmental pollution. Objective The aim of the study was to characterize expired medications collected according to the types of therapeutic groups, pharmaceutical dosage forms, expiration dates and were prescribed or over the counter drugs, and whether they came from Mexican health system or purchased by patients themselves. Setting The study was conducted in the metropolitan area of Monterrey during a 12-month period from March 2012 to February 2013. Method Unused/expired drugs were collected according to the collection and disposal of expired medication program instituted by the Department of Health of the State of Nuevo Len. Pharmacists and students from The Autonomous University of Nuevo Len recorded types of therapeutic groups, total of medicines in each group, among other classification criteria. Main outcome measure The proportion of every collected therapeutic group, type of dosage forms, and expiration date. Results The amount of medications classified was 22,140 items corresponding to a 30 % of the total collected medications in that period of time; most of them belonged to the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (16.11 %). According to the pharmaceutical dosage forms, results showed that a high percentage were solid dosage forms (73.39 %), of the total unused/expired medications, most of them were prescription drugs (91 %) which were purchased at private pharmacies. Expiration date of medications ranges from 1995 to 2016, being 2011 the outstanding year (36.66 %). Conclusion Addressing the aspect of unused drug disposition constitutes a challenge for Mexican government, due to health implications related to inadequate disposition. No matter how efficient the programs of collection and disposal of expired drugs are, none of them can collect all unused or expired drugs, that is the reason why the best approach might be to prevent this need.

AB The growing complexity of drug abuse in Mexico demands the development of more effective programs focusing on specific risk factors. However, due to the difficulties and high costs of longitudinal studies required to identify risk factors properly speaking, it is common to conduct cross-sectional studies for the identification of drug abuse correlates. Several studies with Mexican Population have found, as drug abuse correlates, alcohol and tobacco use, drug abuse among family members, weak family control and Support, belonging to dysfunctional social networks, inadequate leisure or recreational activities, and behavioral and psychological disorders such as low behavioral control, depression and anxiety.
   On this basis and considering illicit drug abuse as an inadaptative way of coping with anxiety and depression, as the basic forms of psychological distress, this study analyzed drug abuse and drug dependence among teenagers in association to exposure to stress factors and its perceived effect, as well to the presence of depressive symptoms. The correlations of drug abuse and dependence to different coping strategies and family cohesion and adaptability, and analyzed Substance use risk perception and drug availability, were also explored. This article includes the findings of bivariate analysis intended to evaluate the strength of associations between variables.
   Method This research followed an ex post facto design for a case-control study with a non-probabilistic sample of young people between 10 and 18 years: 116 abusers and 102 illicit drug dependents (according to DSM IV criteria), and 679 non-users paired by age sex and neighborhood. Cases were selected from drug users attending treatment at "Centros de Integracion Juvenil" units in Mexico City. Members of the control group were recruited and interviewed at home. Information was gathered by structured interviews and questionnaires including substance use data, and eight scales that explored stress factors exposure; coping strategies; depression symptoms; family structure, cohesion and adaptability; substance risk perception and availability
   Findings 82.3% of the subjects of study were men and 17.7% were women. Mean age was 15.35 years (SD=15.56). 98.5% were single. Substances more frequently reported both by abusers and dependents were marthuana, inhalants, cocaine and tranquilizers, although the dependent group reported significantly higher use rates per substance.
   Exposure to stress factors and perceived stress were higher as severity of drug use increased. The reported frequency of problem solving strategies decreased slightly but significantly in terms of drug use severity, while other ways of coping showed no differences between groups. Depression symptoms, lower risk perception, and higher drug availability were positively related to the intensity of drug use. Finally, there were significant differences on the levels of family, cohesion and adaptability associated with abuse or dependence.
   Discussion Findings support initial hypotheses, showing significant differences between groups in terms of greater dysfunctionality associated to drug abuse and dependence. Thus, data support the notion of drug use as an inadaptative way of coping, the broadly documented correlation with stress and depression, rigid family interaction patterns, and lack of supportive and affective family links. In spite of limitations of this research as a cross-sectional study with a non-probabilistic sample, findings provide indicators of presumed risk factors, contributing to the design and application of prevention and treatment strategies focusing on specific and malleable factors.

AB Introduction
   In the course of the last three years, a wide range of epidemiological studies related to drug use has been conducted, both at a national and international level. Talking about national studies in the field of school population, surveys have been conducted in the states of Colima, Nuevo Leon and Jalisco, as well as surveys in university population, among others. Regarding tobacco use, several studies were made and they covered many cities of the country. About household surveys, the fifth National Addictions Survey (ENA) was carried out in 2008 and it provided data at a national and state level. The Global Survey of Smoking in Adults (GATS) was also made having nationwide coverage. In relation to tobacco use, the trend shows a decrease in the prevalence of consumption. This is shown in ENA 2008 and OATS, as well as school population studies in different states. For alcohol consumption, the situation is different; both for the prevalence and for the proportion of people who start its early consumption, significant increases have been reported throughout the country. Alcohol abuse remains constant and is similar between men and women. When considering the use of illegal drugs, there is an overall increase. As for marijuana, data indicates that its consumption has increased and that it remains as the primary drug of use. However, the main increase is for inhalants, particularly among school population and especially in women. For cocaine, data from United Nations shows a significant decrease in the supply of this substance due to the increase of seizures. Data from ENA 2008 shows that the use of this drug has doubled between 2002 and 2008. The United Nations report indicates that the increase in our country is apparent until 2005 and since then it has been decreasing. Methamphetamine use remains low and it does not increase. Only in the case of the population that goes to service centers for drug users, a high rate of consumption is found. Finally, the consumption of heroin and hallucinogens is low. Chihuahua remains as the state with the most problems in the use of heroine. Most recent surveys have allowed us to see, in general, some of the trajectories in adolescent menial health, where sexual abuse is presented first in women, followed by ADDH, then the consumption of legal drugs, antisocial behavior, use of inhalants and suicide attempt. Then drug consumption, marijuana and cocaine. In men, the sequence is similar, although they face ADDH first and then sexual abuse. In this context, the objective of this study is to assess the prevalence of drug, alcohol and tobacco use, as well as consumption trends in school population from 7(th) to 12(th) grade from Mexico City and its political delegations.
   Method
   To ensure the comparability with similar studies carried out in Mexico in school population, the methodology used in this study maintains the basic aspects of the previous measurements that have been made in students from 7(th) to 12(th) grade from Mexico City and other states. The project had the approval of the ethics committee from the National Institute of Psychiatry Ramon de la Fuente Muniz, and was approved by the educational authorities of Mexico City to be applied in school population. The unit of analysis from which the information was obtained were the students enrolled in 7(th) to 12(th) grade in 2008-2009 from public and private schools in Mexico City. The sampling frame was developed based on the official records of the 2008-2009 school year. A non-response rate of 20%, a confidence level of 95% and an average absolute error of 0.004 were considered. The sample design was stratified by level of education (7(th) to 9(th) grades and 10(th) to 12(th) grades) and political delegations, which gave 32 different strata. It was also clustered by scholar group which was the primary unit of selection. The sample of groups and students were weighted considering the group, educational level and the delegation.
   A final sample of 22 980 subjects was obtained: 49.8% were female and 50.2% were men. 56.3% of the sample attended to 7(th) to 9(th) grades and 43.7% attended to 10(th) to 12(th) grades. In addition, most of the male and female adolescents were full-time students during the year prior to the study and only 7% of men and 5.1% of women were not students. 23.3% of men and 11.9% of women worked part or full time, and additionally, most of them had both parents. The information was obtained through a standardized questionnaire, which has been applied in previous surveys and has been previously validated. Due to the extension of the instrument, four forms were used to include various sections, the main part of questionnaire was administered to all subjects and the last two pages corresponded to forms, so each form was applied to one quarter of the sample. Alcohol consumption indicators used are comparable with WHO indicators, international observatories from Europe and the ones used in "Monitoring the Future." Additionally, a significant amount of risk and protective factors related to drug use was evaluated.
   Results
   Regarding tobacco use, it decreased from 48.3% to 44.3% compared to the study made in 2006, and men were the ones who had the highest percentage (45.9%) compared with women (42.6%). Additionally, the average onset age is of 12.8 years. As for the current use of tobacco the situation is similar, the percentage is higher in men than in women and is much higher among students from 7(th) to 9(th) grades than among students from 10(th) to 12(th) grades. In the case of alcohol, its consumption has increased from 68.8% to 71.4%; it was similar in women compared to the last measurement and in men it increased. The prevalence of alcohol abuse decreased from 25.2% to 23.4% compared to the previous survey. However, the students who have taken alcohol had an average onset age of 12.6 years. The problematic alcohol consumption measured with the long version of AUDIT found that in 7(th) to 9(th) grades, 17.1% of men and 16.3% of women reported having this type of consumption. In 10(th) to 12(th) grades, 36.5% of men and 28.5% of women also reported problematic use of alcohol. Regarding dangerous alcohol consumption, 7.2% of men and 6.7% of women presented it in 7(th) to 9(th) grades. Students from 10(th) to 12(th) grades had higher percentages being of 22.5% in men and 15.3% in women. The study shows a significant increase in drug consumption: during the last three years it has raised from 17.8% to 21.5%. Within each substance use, the consumption of inhalants, marijuana, hallucinogens, and methamphetamines has increased in comparison with the study of 2006. The preference by drug type has changed slightly over the past three years; in men marijuana has the first place of preference (14%), followed by inhalants (10.8%) and in third place of preference is cocaine (4.3%). Women prefer inhalants (10.0%), followed by marijuana (8.8%) and then tranquilizers (5.6%). In terms of additional behaviors evaluated on this study, it is noteworthy that the age of first sexual intercourse decreased by almost half a year in women. All other behaviors (suicide attempt, depressive symptoms, risky eating behaviors, antisocial acts) remained equal.
   Discussion
   In this context, the study results show a widespread use of drugs in the population, with major increases specially between women. Adding the presence of other problematic behaviors related to drug use, leads us to make a reflection on the general mental health problems experienced by the population and together they give a guideline for working immediately on various preventive actions. The work made with nursery and elementary boys and girls developing strategies and social skills that enable them to increase their personal and social resources; likewise, working with parents, teachers and health personnel, through positive parenting programs, in groups and teaching them directly effective strategies for interaction and discipline with their children or students under their charge through modeling, are factors that lead to better prevention in most sectors of population. A social policy that allocates more financial and human resources aimed to support these activities must be added to these efforts, especially to support research in general and particularly to support research that leads to develop optimal prevention practices for new generations. Therefore, the importance of translating these elements into action lies in the possibility of having healthier generations and a society with better expectations, approaches and opportunities for growing.

AB Introduction: Research focused on drug consumption in schools has been developed in Mexico since 1976 and has allowed for a constant monitoring of this behavior in the population. The National Institute of Psychiatry Ramon de la Fuente (INP) and the Public Education Administration (SEP) have been the pionering institutions in these efforts, where other interested institutions and states add their contributions to the assessment of the problem in this social sector. Due to the need of developing local preventive programs to reduce drug consumption, several regions of the country have carried out, in a first si age, situational diagnoses of drug consumption. These data, in addition to other community information sources, have helped to enhance efforts in terms of prevention. To date, the main investigations related to Students are the Fourth National Survey on Addictions, the National Survey from the National System for the Integral Family Development, regional surveys with young students from 7(th) to 9(th) grades (Queretaro; Rioverde, S in Luis Potosi; Sinaloa; Tamaulipas and Ciudad Guzman, Jalisco.), from 10(th) to 12(th) grade (same states, except for Ciudad Guzman and the stud), done in Guanajuato whose results have not been published yet) and college (Rioverde). The main findings for adolescents and youths obtained from these studies show an increase in drug consumption, specially for alcohol, cannabis and metamphetamines, although the general index of consumption remains steady since 2001, specially in the case of cocaine. There have also been changes in men and female contributions to the consumption index, giving similar prevalences for alcohol and tobacco in both. Regional variations have been observed, where drug consumption is higher in more urbanized cities. However, new generations are more affected by, this phenomenon regardless of the level of urbanization of the place where they five. Also, as it has been previously established, being in a scholastic environment is a protective factor against drug consumption, beacause consumption is higher among adolescents who do not study, and it is a differential factor that protects men more than women. As a consequence, these sources and different students' surveys point out that the probability of drug consumption increases when a minor is working. Additionally, studies report that an early consumption onset for tobacco and alcohol, mainly before 13 years old, increases the possibility of consuming other drugs. This fact is important because Several reports on the literature show that age of onset for consuming these drugs is becoming earlier. It is relevant to consider that drug consumption is not an isolated factor. It is known that some precursors for drug consumption are the same for other behaviors, as sexual intercourses without protection, antisocial, delinquent behaviors or suicide attempt. In behalf of this, prevention programs must be designed in an integral,way considering the global environment of adolescents, and not just focused on drug consumption. From this point of view, results From the survey on drug use carried out among students in Mexico City in autumn, 2003, are presented. This survey is the most recent diagnosis about this problem in Mexican adolescents, and keeps the methodological standards of previous surveys.
   Objective: The aim of the present work is to give a recent and complete view about this problem and prevention opportunities for adolescents of Mexico City and the whole country.
   Materials and method: The study comprised a randomized sample of 10,659 students from Mexico City, with a two-stage design (school-group), and stratified (from 7(th) to 9(th) grades, and from 10(th) to 12(th) grades, technical and normal), where the last selection unit was the scholar group. Data is representative for delegation(1) and educational level, and the design is similar to those previously applied in schools by the INP and SEP. The reviewed sample frame was obtained from the registrations to the 2001-2002 school period of SEP. A randomized sample was obtained for each county and educational level. Regarding estimations precision, calculated non-response index was 15%, with an absolute error average of 0.004, and a design effect equaling 2. The confidence intervals obtained were generated by the STATA program, version 7.0. The mean-age of the subjects was 14.6 Years (12-22 Years), 50.5% of the sample were men and 49.5% were women. The indicators of drug consumption included in the questionnaire are the same used in similar studies and are the same used by the WHO. In addition to drug consumption and related problems, several behaviors were assessed among adolescents, Such as suicide attempt, level of depression, eating risk behaviors and some features of their sexual behavior. Interviewers,x ere trained to obtain the most reliable information from the adolescents and to keel) confidentiality. A total of 23 interviewers and five supervisors participated in the study.
   Results: First of all, a slightly increase in drug consumption was found in the last three Years, from 14.7% to 15.2%, which is not significitive. Nevertheless, there are significant changes in the consumption of specific drugs. There is a significant increase in can\nabis consumption, while inhalants and tranquilizers remain steady and Cocaine use showed a slightly decrease. BY sex, it was observed that drug consumption in women has increased, while in men it remains steady or has even decreased a little. In this context, drug preferences remain very similar to those reported three years ago, where cannabis Occupied the First place, followed by inhalants, tranquilizers and cocaine (with similar levels of consumption between the last three ones). The drugs of preference among women are tranquilizers. With respect to legal drug,,,,, alcohol consumption has increased, while tobacco consumption remains similar to the reported in the survey of 2000. A significant change in these drugs, as mentioned above, is that then consumption is almost the same among men and women. Talking about alcohol abuse, a 2% increase was observed, which indicates 23.8% of the adolesceuts had consumed at least Five drinks per occasion during the month previous to the study. In regional terms, there were also changes. The most affected delegations are Azcapotzalco, Venustiano Carranza, Miguel Hidalgo and Cuauhtemoc. In the last survey, the most affected delegations were Gustavo A. Madero and Coyoacan. This is very important information, because the SEP implemented several prevention strategies in these two delegations in order to reduce drug consumption. Considering the results of the present study, It call be concluded these efforts were successful. Even though results will be presented in a specific publication, according to the adolescents' evaluation of the brochure given to each student at the end of the application, we can sa, they were very positive, as 15% of the adolescents indicated they had quitted smoking and a similar percentage reported I decrease in their tobacco consumption. Another 15% mentioned they had used help telephone fines, and more than 60% shared the content of the brochure with their families. Most of them have kept the brochure for future occasions and have also lent it to friends.
   Discussion: The data about drug consumption is similar to the data of other national studies reporting that consumption of medical and illegal drugs and tobacco, is steadier oil the whole, although there are changes in specific drugs consumption and by sex. Meanwhile, the prevalence of alcohol consumption has been increasing, even when its abuse remains stable. For prevention, it is important to consider the new location of the problem (most affected delegations), and to use crime indicators and other delinquent behaviors, to share prevention efforts in the most affected areas of the city. Another,interesting result is the low level of risk perception for tobacco and alcohol consumption, which are important precursors for the consumption of other drugs, especially if there is an early consumption onset for these substances. In the context of drug consumption associated with other adolescents' problems, suicide attempt is the most frequent situation reported by the participants (16%) and it is even more frequent than drug consumption. Although this situation seems to be quite problematic, adolescent population in scholastic environments is the least affected in comparison to those that quit or stop studying. On the other hand, the information obtained about the brochure "What's up with your life?" is encouraging for prevention practices, and the presence and growth of these problems makes it important to consider that the process of obtaining information as all integral part of the diagnosis may also be used as an opportunity to reach adolescents with information or materials created for them. Finally it is important to point out that prevention must be applied during childhood and not only during adolescence. To reach this goal, it is important to include all possible human resources. The point is simple: the possibilities to obtain better results under this conception are greater, because the interaction with children and their complete integration at home facilitate this prevention task. During childhood, the human being is more receptive to this kind of interventions and it is simpler to work with the families. So, When children grow up, it will fie easier to communicate with them as adolescents and to give them all the support they require in their identity formation. Even when the work is focused oil the longer term, the results will be better and we will be able to offer better options to the new generations from the construction of an adequate prevention culture.

AB Background
   In Mexico, alcohol is the most widely used substance among young adults. Alcohol consumption in this age group contributes importantly to the most frequent causes of mortality and morbidity (e.g., accidents, violence, homicides, suicide and risky behaviors).
   Around the world, college or university attendance has emerged in the literature as a risk factor for drinking problems among young adults. In Mexico, data from the most recent National Survey on Addictions showed that lifetime and current drinking is experienced by more than half of the Mexicans attending college education. Despite this, in our country there is a paucity of epidemiological studies examining drinking behavior and correlates among those attending college. Findings in non-representative samples of students attending public and private universities in Mexico City suggest that, during the last two decades, there has been an increase in the frequency of lifetime and current drinking in this population. Additionally, these studies have shown that, in comparison to young adults of the same age in the general population, university students may experience a greater prevalence of lifetime and current alcohol drinking.
   Regarding the frequency of unhealthy drinking among Mexican college students, to our knowledge there are no prevalence estimates of hazardous or harmful drinking published. However, observations in non-random samples of university students in Mexico City suggested that at least one in three men and one in five women incurred in unhealthy drinking (e.g., >= 5 drinks per occasion or drinking to intoxication) at least once during the last month. Hazardous and harmful drinking is respectively defined by a pattern of alcohol consumption conferring a greater risk for health problems or that is frankly conducive to medical or psychological complications (e.g., accidents, victimization, violence, alcohol dependence, liver cirrhosis and/or other medical complications).
   The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), developed by the World Health Organization, is currently the only instrument specifically designed to identify hazardous and harmful drinking. Although the AUDIT was initially validated among older adult patients in primary care settings, this instrument has consistently shown to be valid and reliable in detecting alcohol problems in different populations such as the college students in many countries around the world.
   Given the public health implications of estimating the frequency of hazardous and harmful drinking among college students in Mexico, and given the importance of elucidating the variables influencing this problem, we decided to conduct the present study. To our knowledge, this is the first report published in the international literature on the prevalence of hazardous and harmful drinking among college students in a Latin American country.
   Objective
   In the analysis described here, derived from the project entitled Early Identification and Treatment of Problem Drinkers at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), our aim was to examine the frequency and risk factors for hazardous and harmful drinking among Mexican university students. More specifically, our objectives were: 1. To determine the post-year prevalence of hazardous and harmful drinking among UNAM college freshmen; and 2. To examine in this population the effects of demographic and family variables on the likelihood of hazardous and harmful drinking.
   Subjects and methods
   This study was a cross-sectional survey that was conducted at the beginning of the school year during the registration period between September 1st and September 30th, 2005. In 2005, a total of 34 000 students were accepted to initiate college at the nine UNAM college campuses located in the Mexico City metropolitan area. Of these, 24 921 (73.3%) students (age=18.7 +/- 4.3 years; 55.7% women) consented in answering the survey and provided complete data. Consequently, 9 079 students (26.7%) were excluded from the analysis due to lack of consent, incomplete data or due to their absence at the time of registration.
   We used the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) to examine past-year prevalence of hazardous and harmful drinking. This self-report instrument includes 10 items that examine frequency and intensity of drinking (items 1-3), presence of alcohol dependence symptoms (items 4-6) and negative consequences of drinking (items 7-10), yielding a maximum possible score of 40 points. Among adult patients in primary care settings, it has been accepted that an AUDIT score of 0-7 points reflects safe levels of alcohol consumption, whereas a score of 8 points or greater indicates the presence of hazardous and harmful drinking. It has been described, however, that among college students, an AUDIT score of 6 points or greater reliably identifies those students experiencing this problem.
   In the analysis presented here, we separately examined and reported the prevalence estimates and correlates of hazardous and harmful drinking using both AUDIT cut-off scores (>= 6 and >= 8).
   The AUDIT was administered at the same time as a wellness screening survey that the UNAM Medical Services routinely administer to all registering freshmen at the beginning of the school year. Questions in the wellness survey pertained students' medical and dental health, family medical history, immunizations, use of tobacco and other drugs.
   In addition, demographic and socioeconomic information was obtained from a questionnaire also routinely administered by the UNAM registrar's office. This questionnaire included 37 items inquiring about gender, age, employment and marital status, monthly family income, parental education, place and type of residency, persons with whom the student resided, and questions on previous academic performance.
   We estimated the prevalence of hazardous and harmful drinking and their respective 95% confidence intervals [95% CI] in the total of the sample, and separately by age group, gender, marital and working status, monthly family income group, parental education, and by variables reflecting whether the students lived with their family, peers or alone. These variables were modeled using simulated binary terms (0,1). Subsequently, multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between hazardous and harmful drinking and the demographic and socioeconomic variables listed above. These were entered simultaneously into the logistic regression equation. In order to summarize the level of risk of hazardous and harmful drinking conferred by significant variables in the logistic regression model, odds ratios (OR) and their respective 95% CI's were estimated. All the significant effects reported here were adjusted considering the effects of the remaining demographic and socioeconomic variables.
   Results
   Among the university freshmen examined here, when an AUDIT cutoff score of >= 8 was used, the prevalence of hazardous and harmful drinking was 11.1%. When an AUDIT score of >= 6 was considered, a frequency of 18.4% was then observed. Men (AUDIT >= 8: 17.3%; AUDIT >= 6: 27.4%) experienced this problem more frequently than women (AUDIT >= 8: 6.2%; AUDIT >= 6: 11.3%). The greater prevalence of hazardous and harmful drinking among men was observed in all age groups and regardless of working or marital status, family income, parental education or regardless of the persons with whom the student reported to reside. Controlling for demographic and socioeconomic differences between men and women, we found that the risk of experiencing hazardous and harmful drinking among men was almost three times greater than in women (OR's [95% CI]: AUDIT >= 8 or >= 6 respectively: 2.9[2.7-3.3] or 2.8[2.6-3.0]).
   In both, men and women, the greatest frequency of hazardous and harmful drinking occurred among those 20 to 25 years of age. Older students showed a gradual reduction in the prevalence of this problem; with those who were 29 years old or older experiencing the lowest risk of being affected.
   Among those students who reported to work, there was a greater frequency and increased risk of hazardous and harmful drinking. Furthermore, this risk increased with the number of reported weekly working hours. This last effect was seen unequivocally only in men, with the greatest likelihood of hazardous and harmful drinking being observed among the group of male students weekly working 32 hours or longer.
   Also, a higher monthly family income was associated with a greater chance of hazardous and harmful drinking. Men in the highest family income group (10 or more minimum salaries) experienced the greatest risk for this problem. Among women, however, this effect was only observed when an AUDIT cut-off score of six or greater was used to screen for hazardous and harmful drinking.
   Although we did not find any effects of the number of years of parental education on the probability of drinking problems in male students, among women, there was a greater risk of hazardous and harmful drinking among students having a father with a greater number of years of education (>= 12 years). Similarly, among female students, a greater number of years of education in the mother (>= 12 years) also increased the chance of being affected by hazardous and harmful drinking.
   Regarding variables that conferred a reduction in the prevalence and in the risk of hazardous and harmful drinking, we observed that those students who were married experienced a reduction in the likelihood of this problem.
   Finally, in our sample, there were no effects on the probability of hazardous and harmful drinking from variables reflecting whether the students lived with their family, with peers or alone.
   Conclusions
   Hazardous and harmful drinking is a frequent problem among Mexican university freshmen. Variables associated with an increased risk of this problem may exert their effects by facilitating availability and access to alcoholic beverages, and facilitating exposure to high-risk activities for alcohol consumption. These findings have direct implications in designing preventive and treatment interventions in the larger population of college and university students in Mexico.

TI Depressive symptoms in pregnancy and associated factors in patients of
   three health institutions in Mexico City
SO SALUD MENTAL

ID POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION; CHILDBEARING WOMEN; LIFE EVENTS; AMERICAN
AB Background
   Depression is a frequent condition in pregnancy; at least as frequent as it is among non-pregnant women. Studies on its prevalence show rates from 2% to 21% of major depression. and 8% to 31% of depressive symptomatology. In Mexico, a prevalence of 22% has been estimated on the basis of a self-report scale. Risk factors for depression in pregnancy include previous history of depression, parental separation during childhood, single motherhood, not wishing to be pregnant, lack of social support and low educational attainment.
   Objective
   Due to the consequences of depression on pregnancy and to the scarce studies available in Mexico, the aim of this study was to examine the presence of depression in pregnant women as well as the risk factors associated with the latter.
   Material and methods
   Three hundred pregnant women receiving ante-natal care were interviewed in the waiting rooms of three institutions (one third level hospital, a health center and a clinic specializing in women). The instrument included a scale of depression (CES-D) and the following risk factors: previous depression symptoms, parental separation before the age of 11, possible depression and problematic alcohol consumption in expectant mother's parents, unplanned pregnancy and lack of social support.
   Results
   A total of 30.7% of the interviewees showed significant depressive symptomatology (CES-D > 16). Fifty-nine percent mentioned having suffered from depressive symptomatology in the past. Some degree of disability in the past month was reported by 19% of those that mentioned depression symptoms. The mean number of days they stopped performing their everyday activities was 11.21 (SD = 10.68) with a range of 1 to 30 days. Seven women (21.2%) stated that they could not engage in their activities because of their depression every single day of the past month. As for suicidal ideation at any time in their liver, the following symptoms were displayed: half said that they had thought a great deal about death, a quarter said that they had wanted to die, nearly a fifth had intended to take their own life and 7.7% had injured themselves in order to take their own lives. During the previous month, the frequency of these behaviors had considerably declined, almost to zero, and only "thinking frequently about death" was common (18%).
   The variables associated with depression symptoms (CES-D) were: previous symptoms of depression (t = -4-40, p > 0.000), separation from the father before the age of 11 (t = -2.68; p > 0.008), possible depression in mother (t = -3.24, p > 0.001), possible depression in father (t = -2.41, p > 0.016), problematic alcohol consumption in father (t= -2.23, p > 0.040), unplanned pregnancy (t=-2.43, p > 0-015), lack of emotional social support (t = 2.87, p > 0.005) and lack of practical social support (t = 2.94, p > 0.005). The evaluation of a risk model of these factors on depressive symptomatology through logistic regression (with the step-by-step method) showed that the following variables were significant: possible depression in the mother (of the expectant mother) which increases the risk of displaying depression in pregnancy 0.8 times, previous depressive symptomatology; which increases it 1.08 times, lack of practical social support, which increases it 1.71 times and not having a partner, which increases it 1.51 times.
   Discussion and conclusions The results, as regards mental health, showed that depressive symptoms occured in nearly a third of pregnant women; this percentage is higher than the 22% found in Mexico in previous studies. Although this symptomatology does not necessarily meet the criteria for major depression, it has been considered to be of sufficient clinical importance, as it has been associated with disability, psychiatric and physical co-morbidity; demand for treatment for and risk of future depression and in this case, with postpartum depression. A fifth of the subjects displayed more serious symptomatology in terms of disability, as the women mentioned not being able to engage in their everyday activities, working or studying. The mean number of days in which they were unable to carry out their activities was eleven during the previous month. This data suggests that this population with greater pathology should be detected and referred for specialized mental care by ante-natal care services. Suicidal ideation during the previous month decreased considerably, in comparison with that reported at any time in their lives, which agrees with reports that state that self-damaging behaviors and suicide attempts tend to be very low during pregnancy.
   As for pathological antecedents, 59% considered that they had suffered from depressive symptomatology in the past, in addition to having experienced suicidal ideation to varying degrees. It is significant that nearly 8% had previously attempted suicide. Both, previous depressive symptomatology and suicidal ideation in the past, were associated with current depression symptoms in the expectant mother, as has been reported in other countries.
   Unplanned pregnancy was also related to depression (CES-D). As literature suggests, not wishing to be pregnant is related to this disorder and although not planning a pregnancy is not synonymous with not wishing for it, according to these data, lack of planning also increases depressive symptoms.
   Among childhood situations, parental separation or loss of the father before the age of 11 was a significant variable as regards symptomatology in pregnancy; this was similar to what other authors have reported. Separation from the mother was not related to these symptoms, contrary to what other studies have reported in both pregnant and non-pregnant women. Adversity in childhood in the form of parents' mental pathology or substance use has been associated with depression among the general population. The results obtained here show a significant relationship between problematic alcohol consumption in the father and possible depression in the mother or father-as perceived by the interviewee herself- and depression symptoms in the expectant mother.
   During pregnancy and above all, post-partum, women have a real need to receive both emotional and practical support. This study, like others showed that the lack of this support increased the risk of depression.
   The construction of a model with some of these variables showed that being a single or divorced mother, having had a mother who may have been depressed, having displayed depressive symptoms in the past and the lack of practical support increased the risk of depressive symptomatology.
   By way of a conclusion, one can say that although there are similarities between depression in pregnancy and at other moments in women's lives, its presence during this period is particularly important due to the new demands the woman has to cope with and the adverse effects it has on the development of pregnancy, and the high risk of experiencing depression during the post-partum. Designing intervention programs for expectant mothers could have an enormous effect on improving the mental health of mothers and their babies, a reason why it is important to take into account the risk factors described in this study.

AB Mental disorders, including substance abuse, are part of the Mexican epidemiologic scenario and will remain so during several decades. They may even become more prominent as causes of disease, disability, and death in our country. It is thus imperative to frame appropriate management strategies to curb these problems without delay. This paper aims at outlining epidemiology of mental diseases as a field of study, and to identify its limitations. Emphasis is made on common elements shared with other more traditional fields of epidemiology, as well as on the specific contributions made by this particular field to epidemiology and to psychiatry in general. This paper describes the main study designs and problems in this field of epidemiology, its usefulness in prevention actions, and future challenges. A unique characteristic of mental disorder epidemiology is that its target diseases manifest in two levels: behaviorally (for example, compulsive hand-washing) and as an element of the individual's mental life (e.g., obsession with bacteria being a constant, omnipresent health threat). It follows that much of the knowledge currently available on the phenomena of mental disorders in general is based on the self-reported insight of individuals. Trained clinicians have collected such reports by interview or with standardized questionnaires. This field of epidemiology is characterized by having two-sides: a mental disorder is a problem in and of itself, causing suffering and prompting the search for specialized care, as it has peculiar clinical manifestations. On the other hand, mental disorder epidemiology also focuses on determining factors (drug use, abuse, or addiction) and on the way these independent variables result in certain processes and outcomes (such as accidents, homicide, suicide, liver cirrhosis, etc.). Finally, the epidemiology of mental disorders has also been set apart by its focus in series of processes that are not suitably classified as syndromes, but which are germane to public health, for example, violence. The epidemiology of mental disorders faces great challenges in the new millennium, including a complex, changing epidemiologic scenario. Several important issues will influence the future development of mental disorder epidemiology: measurement of mental disorders and risk factors, more efficient sampling design and methods, the relationships among biological research, genetics, social studies, and epidemiology, and the interface between epidemiology and the evaluation of therapies and health services.

ID DRUG-USE; FALL
AB Introduction. This paper analyses the evolution of antisocial behavior within the context of representative cross-sectional studies in student population from Mexico City Surveys with students have collected data about substance use and related factors. The latter is associated with antisocial behavior and delinquency, eating disorders, risk sexual behavior, and suicide attempt.
   Statistics on younger offenders show an increased number of subjects presented before law institutions, meaning that they have been prosecuted somehow (there were 2623 cases in 1999, and 3506 in 2003). At the same time, there is a decrease in the age for committing these faults which are becoming more serious; a larger number of homicides, raping, and carrying weapons have been reported.
   The objective of this paper is to present tendencies of antisocial behavior through data obtained from three different representative surveys in junior high school and high school students from Mexico City (1997, 2000, and 2003). Surveys were held by the Instituto Nacional de Psiquiatria Ramon de la Fuente and by the Secretaria de Educacion Publica.
   Method. The analysis unit considered for this study was the student himself coming from state and private schools. Three levels were studied: junior high school, high school, and technical schools.
   Sample design was planned based on the evaluation of drug use tendencies in the students from this population, determining the level of contribution of each district in the city Schools were randomly selected in each of the 16 districts. Sample design was stratified, two-staged, and in clusters. Stratification variable was the level of the school. First selection unit was the school, and second was the school group. Sample was self weighted using the city district as the weigh variable.
   Three probabilistic samples were obtained, representing each one of the districts and education level: 1997 sample, N-10173; 2000 sample, N=10578; 2003 sample, N=10659. Outcome rate in each measure was 97% in 1997, 95% in 2000, and 98% in 2003. Age mean in the three samples was 14.6 years old, and equivalence men-women was similar in the three studies. Questionnaire used has been validated before, and its basic indicators have maintained consistency through different researches Socioeconomic and antisocial behavior data were used for this study.
   Two factors previously obtained were used. The first one was called Violence and Thieving Behaviors, this one includes picking things worth 50 pesos or less, taking things from a store without paying for them, damaging other people's property, punching or hurting someone, being involved in fights, and using firing objects. The second factor was called Serious Antisocial Behaviors, and it included: picking things worth 500 pesos or more, breaking locks, attacking someone using an object or weapon, selling drugs, and using a knife or gun to rob someone. These factors have been already used and have shown good consistency.
   The survey operative design included a main coordinator, supervisors, and pollsters who were trained on conceptual issues about addiction, project background and objectives, instrument use, instructions for interviewing, and group selection. Emphasis was made on proper instructions for subjects, as well as remarks for anonymity and confidentiality in handling information.
   Inconsistent questionnaires were corrected or eliminated. Intelligent soft-ware was used for registering data, which verified that the answers were coherent.
   Results. There was a 2% increase in antisocial behaviors among students between 1997 and 2000; the most notorious raise was observed in behaviors from factor Violence and Thieving, which fluctuated between .57% and 1.8%. From 2000 to 2003 there was a raise of 6.7% for any antisocial behavior, and the increase was again more notorious in Violence and Thieving (6.5%).
   There were minor increases in the second factor, though these were important. For instance, picking things worth 500 pesos or more, and attacking someone had a bigger raise in 2000 and 2003, while breaking locks had its bigger raise between 1997 and 2000. No change,, were observed for selling drugs and using a knife or gun to rob someone.
   There was a 2.47% increase for any antisocial behavior in men between 1997 and 2000, basically in the factor Violence and Thieving. From 2000 to 2003 this increase raised to 7.36%, observed again in the Violence and Thieving factor.
   In the case of women, there was only an increase in two behaviors between 1997 and 2000: picking things for 50 pesos or less and breaking locks. From 2000 to 2003 there was an important increase in behaviors pertaining to Violence and Thieving (5.71%), to be involved in fights had the highest increase. Between 2000 and 2003, women participated in more serious acts.
   The proportion of students behaving antisocially was calculated considering the districts. The district of Tlalpan had the only increase observed between 1997 and 2000. Significant raise was observed in almost every district (except for Cuajimalpa and Gustavo A. Madero) from 2000 to 2003. Venustiano Carranza, Benito Juarez, Iztacalco, and Alvaro Obregon had the biggest increase. Variations are the same for both factors.
   Discussion. This study allows to see the changes in antisocial behavior rates in Mexico City students from 1997 to 2003. Slight variations were found in some behaviors between 1997 and 2000, there were no modifications in others. However, there was an important raise from 2000 to 2003, which is bigger if compared to 1997.
   Increase in antisocial behavior is similar for men and women, although proportion is unequal yet; almost two men for every woman. When considering district as a control variable, Benito Juarez and Tlalpan show the higher prevalences on any antisocial behavior. This situation is similar for Violence and Thieving. In the case of Serious Antisocial Behaviors, Venustiano Carranza and Azcapotzalco had the higher prevalences.
   It is important to fully understand the reasons of adolescents for behaving antisocially. Apparently the conditions facilitating this type of behaviors are not only related to marginalization and social disadvantage, but to others, such as new interaction ways, which favor the search for exciting sensations and hiding from supervision. This includes involvement in risk behaviors, such as unsafe sexual intercourse, drug use, violence, and burgling.
   It is necessary to go deeper into these new forms of antisocial behavior and to work more in prevention as an attempt to counteract present tendencies of this issue.

AB In Mexico, addictions among the middle- and high-school student population have been widely studied, which has shed light on certain risks associated with alcohol abuse, including a higher probability of expriencing with other drugs -particularly in the case of males-, engaging in risky sexual practices and attempting suicide, a situation that is twice as common among those who drink and drive. Nevertheless, research on alcohol abuse among the university population has been less explored, particularly as regards the identification of the variables that predict excessive alcohol consumption. A review of the international literature on factors associated with alcohol abuse in this type of population indicates that it is among university students that high or explosive consumption tends to be largest, even among young people who do not attend school, and that the period of higher consumption is between 17 and 21 years of age. Other factors that have been identified include exposure to negative life events, inappropriate coping styles, personality variables, resorting to alcohol to reduce tension, and environmental and socio-cognitive variables, foremost among which are expectations of the positive effects of alcohol. These expectations not only predict alcohol consumption but also differentiate between problem and non-problem drinking. For example, while social drinkers tend to harbor more social expectations when drinking alcohol, excessive drinkers expect alcohol to increase their aggressive and social behavior, while reducing stress or tension. This paper seeks to evaluate the impact of expectations regarding alcohol, in predicting alcohol abuse among students at public and private universities in Mexico City. Indicators of alcohol abuse include consumption of five or more drinks on each occasion, drunkenness during the past month and year as well as associated problems. The study also seeks to determine the way in which sub-scales of expectations interact with each other. An ex post facto transversal study was carried out on a sample of 678 university male and female students aged 17 to 25, with an average age of 20 (s.d. = 1.80). Participants were asked to complete a self-report which included the following areas: a) Sociodemographic data, b) Questionnaire on Expectations regarding Alcohol (AEQ), in a version adapted to this population and c) Alcohol consumption habits over the past month and year. As regards drinking habits, a comparative analysis was carried out by sex and age. Consumption of 5 or more drinks per occasions tends to be more common among men, while the consumption of 5 drinks or less is more frequent in women. At the same time, a higher proportion of heavy drinkers was concentrated in the 20 to 22 age range. Consumers of over 5 glasses of alcohol began drinking at an average age of 14 (s.d. = 2.55) whereas consumers of fewer than 5 drinks began drinking at the age of 15 (t = 4.79, p < .001). In both cases, the means obtained from the indicators of abuse were highest among consumers of five or more drinks. Males take more drinks than women when they get drunk, consuming an average of 9 glasses (s.d. = 4.7) whereas women get drunk after an average of 5 glasses (s.d. = 3.2) (t = -10.80, p < .001). Out of a total of 26% of young people who mentioned having problems associated with their drinking, most were men (17.9%) as opposed to women (8.2%).
   The multiple regression analysis carried out to determine the impact of the sub-scales of AEQ expectations on alcohol abuse found that expectations regarding alcohol as a acifilator of group interaction" and the sub-scale of "reduction of psychological tension" were the main predictors of abuse. This model explained 20% of the variance (F = 19.33, p < .001). A logistic regression analysis found that the sub-scale of expectations regarding "increase of power and aggression" as well as alcohol abuse predicted problems associated with drinking. A model was subsequently designed to integrate the expectations that predicted alcohol abuse and associated problems. A structural equations model was used which found that expectations regarding "reduction of psychological tension" and alcohol as a facilitator of group interaction predicted 30% and 24% of abuse, respectively (X2sb = 33.52, p > 0.00, CFI = 0.99 and RMSEA = 0.01). The rest of the subscales concerning expectations were regarded as mediating variables to see how they interacted with each other. As one can see, although the sub-scales of expectations are inter-related, group expectations were specifically associated with the sub-scales of "increase in sexuality,", "physical tension" and "increase in power and aggression." At the same time, expectations regarding "reduction of psychological tension" are closely linked to the social sphere, specifically the expectations regarding "verbal expressiveness" and "lack of inhibition." Along these same fines, alcohol abuse and the expectations regarding alcohol as an agent that increases feelings of power and aggression predicted 26% and 28% of alcohol-related problems. One of the contributions of this research is that it considered the inter-relationship of sub-scales of expectations to explain alcohol abuse. Psychological tension, for example, appears to be linked to social aspects, specifically to verbal expressiveness and lack of inhibition, while group expectations refer to sexuality, the reduction of psychological tension and the increase of aggressiveness and feelings of power. Likewise, it is interesting to note that in addition to alcohol abuse, expectations regarding an increase in power and feelings of aggression are the best predictors of problems associated with alcohol use. The results have implications at the intervention level for developing programs specifically aimed at this population. The fact that expectations regarding alcohol as a "facilitator of social interaction" is one of the main predictors of abuse indicates the importance of considering environmental factors in the development of prevention programs. This involves including not only young people but also parents, schools, and other adults in order to question the cultural norms that promote beliefs regarding alcohol consumption, as a way of enjoying social interaction with positive, pleasurable states, and as a socially appropriate response for coping with negative events that arise in everyday life, such as drinking to relieve tension, handle crises and as an escape from chronic stress, by providing information on the negative consequences of use and promoting healthier lifestyles. At the intervention level, it is essential to target university students through programs specially designed for young people who engage in high-risk drinking.
   As regards expectations, actions must be carried out to re-signify the positive beliefs surrounding alcohol, by providing information on the high health costs of heavy drinking and offering alternative resources oriented twards other means of responding to stress that do not involve excessive alcohol consumption.

TI Avoiding 40% of the premature deaths in each country, 2010-30: review of
   national mortality trends to help quantify the UN Sustainable
   Development Goal for health
SO LANCET

AB Background The UN will formulate ambitious Sustainable Development Goals for 2030, including one for health. Feasible goals with some quantifiable, measurable targets can influence governments. We propose, as a quatitative health target, "Avoid in each country 40% of premature deaths (under-70 deaths that would be seen in the 2030 population at 2010 death rates), and improve health care at all ages". Targeting overall mortality and improved health care ignores no modifiable cause of death, nor any cause of disability that is treatable (or also causes many deaths). 40% fewer premature deaths would be important in all countries, but implies very different priorities in different populations. Reinforcing this target for overall mortality in each country are four global subtargets for 2030: avoid two-thirds of child and maternal deaths; two-thirds of tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria deaths; a third of premature deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs); and a third of those from other causes (other communicable diseases, undernutrition, and injuries). These challenging subtargets would halve under-50 deaths, avoid a third of the (mainly NCD) deaths at ages 50-69 years, and so avoid 40% of under-70 deaths. To help assess feasibility, we review mortality rates and trends in the 25 most populous countries, in four country income groupings, and worldwide.
   Methods UN sources yielded overall 1970-2010 mortality trends. WHO sources yielded cause-specific 2000-10 trends, standardised to country-specific 2030 populations; decreases per decade of 42% or 18% would yield 20-year reductions of two-thirds or a third.
   Results Throughout the world, except in countries where the effects of HIV or political disturbances predominated, mortality decreased substantially from 1970-2010, particularly in childhood. From 2000-10, under-70 age-standardised mortality rates decreased 19% (with the low-income and lower-middle-income countries having the greatest absolute gains). The proportional decreases per decade (2000-10) were: 34% at ages 0-4 years; 17% at ages 5-49 years; 15% at ages 50-69 years; 30% for communicable, perinatal, maternal, or nutritional causes; 14% for NCDs; and 13% for injuries (accident, suicide, or homicide).
   Interpretation Moderate acceleration of the 2000-10 proportional decreases in mortality could be feasible, achieving the targeted 2030 disease-specific reductions of two-thirds or a third. If achieved, these reductions avoid about 10 million of the 20 million deaths at ages 0-49 years that would be seen in 2030 at 2010 death rates, and about 17 million of the 41 million such deaths at ages 0-69 years. Such changes could be achievable by 2030, or soon afterwards, at least in areas free of war, other major effects of political disruption, or a major new epidemic.

AB Introduction. Our research took place following a prior work developed by James C. Anthony's research group, over the past ten years. In this group's research, the concept of exposure to opportunities to use drugs has been deemed as a useful element to understand the earliest stages of drug involvement, as well as the transition from using one drug such as tobacco and alcohol to consuming other drugs. The concept of exposure opportunity is based on Wade Hampton Frost's balanced force model, which underscores the importance of exposure for an epidemic to happen.
   The concept of exposure to opportunities to use a drug refers to the chance one may have to use any particular drug, for instance a friend or relative who invites someone to use the drug; to use the drug after actively seeking out the opportunity, or else to have being exposed to an opportunity, without any active involvement (when the drug is being used by others and could have been used if wanted, or after an unexpected finding of a drug which was left or hidden by someone else). In spite of the relevance of the exposure to opportunity concept, very little research has been Conducted in Mexico in this area. However, before more research on the matter may take place, it is necessary to develop appropriate measurement instruments for large-scale studies. The main goals of this study, were to develop an instrument to assess exposure to opportunities to use drugs, and to obtain a first estimation of the degree to which middle schools students have been exposed to the use of inhalant drugs, marihuana, and cocaine.
   Methods. Quali-quantitative methods were used in this research, which were used for the whole population of students of two middle schools located in the Historic downtown area of Mexico City. Prior work had been developed at these schools, which allowed to have a better understanding of certain characteristics of the school population, of their parents, and also of the specific organization of the schools.
   The qualitative area of the study was developed first, as the basis on which the quantitative area would be developed later. Focal groups were selected in order to assess if students could understand and accurately report timing and sequence of exposure to opportunities to use drugs. The focal groups were also used to evaluate the potential usefulness of items for a self-administered, paper and pencil survey. The survey was then designed, with questions on exposure to opportunities to use each of the following substances or groups of substances: alcohol, tobacco, marihuana, cocaine, and inhalant drugs, and in regard to current use of each drug. The questionnaire also included other sections to assess suicide ideation and attempts, exposure to violence, depression, and free-time activities. Results from these sections will be reported in future. For each of the sections we used revised versions of previously developed instruments, with the exception of the specific section on violence exposure that was especially introduced in this survey for the first time. It might also be noteworthy that the depression section included a revised version of the CES-D scale, originally developed by Eaton and colleagues in the US, and which has been translated and adapted in Mexico.
   Once the school authorities gave their permission to visit the classrooms, the students were invited to participate in the survey, clearly explaining to them their right to accept or reject our invitation, as well as their right to skip any question that would make them feel uncomfortable. Students were offered strict confidentiality regarding their answers. In fact, the survey was anonymously answered. While none of the students openly refused to participate in the survey, some questions were left unanswered (most questionnaire items showed no more than 5% missing rates). Survey administrators were hired among the staff that participated in the prior study. In spite of this prior experience, on behalf of quality and safety insurance purposes, survey administration procedures and human protection criteria were discussed with the staff of the present study during a special re-training session. We suspect that part of the excellent response from students and teachers was due to the good understanding between school and the survey administrators.
   Results. A total of four focal groups were conducted, in which 23 students participated. Mean age for the focal groups was 13.8 for females and 14.3 for males. Among participants in these focal groups, almost one of three students (actually, 8 out of 23) reported to have had a marihuana exposure opportunity, and also 8 students reported to have had the opportunity of using cocaine. The majority of students reporting marihuana opportunities reported a cocaine exposure opportunity as well. In all groups, students were able to state the sequence of exposure opportunities and current drug use correctly, as well as to identify the age of first drug use. The chief mechanism reported for exposure to opportunities of using marihuana, cocaine and inhalants was the "altruistic" invitation of a friend to try a new drug.
   Out of 810 students who were surveyed, 768 provided useful information for the analyses presented in this paper. One out of four students have been exposed to opportunities to use drugs, with higher exposure among males, older students, subjects who did not attend school in the past year or who were part-time students, those who had been full-time or part-time workers during the past year, and those who lived only with their father (without a "mother"). Regardless of sex, one out of three students who had had an opportunity to use marihuana, cocaine or inhalants were using at the time one or more of these drugs. Thus, only 65 students reported to have used drugs (8.5% of the total). No significant differences were found between males and females in regard to lifetime prevalence of drug use (9.0% and 7.9%, respectively with p > 0.426). One out of three students who had an opportunity to use inhalant drugs, marihuana, or cocaine, currently use either of these drugs.
   The chief mechanism of exposure was that "a friend or acquaintance offered a chance to use the drug as a present". In fact, 8 out of 10 students who had an opportunity to use marihuana were offered the drug by a friend, and similar ratio was found among those with an opportunity to use cocaine. However, only 6 out of 10 students with an opportunity to use inhalants reported that a friend had offered the drug to them as a present. Half of all students with an opportunity to use marihuana and cocaine were approached by someone who offered them these drugs for sale, and the proportion was much smaller for inhalant drugs (40%). Only 18-24% of the students with opportunities to use drugs had actively sought out a chance to try marihuana, cocaine, and inhalants.
   Discussion. This study offers new insights to understand stages of drug involvement, which in turn can illuminate the design and evaluation of prevention interventions. One out of four students has been exposed to an opportunity to use drugs such as marihuana, inhalants, and cocaine. Early identification of risk factors or markers might allow public health practitioners to offer interventions to those who might need them most urgently. However, interventions need to consider and address mechanisms associated with the risk of exposure to opportunities to use drugs, in order to maximize their results. Friends and relatives were the most likely persons to deliver the opportunity to use drugs. It is possible that students who are in the early stages of drug involvement (honey moon stage) might play an important role in creating opportunities to use drugs by other students. Here, pediatricians and school advisors may be able to anticipate the pseudo-altruistic exposure, and reduce the possibility of transition from exposure opportunity to initial drug use.
   The notion of exposure to opportunities to use drugs allows to identify two stages of drug involvement that are significant for intervention design and implementation, as well as for intervention evaluation: before and after exposure. This distinction may be relevant because the prevention potential of an intervention cannot be developed in the absence of exposure.

TI Changes in the psychopathology of borderline personality disorder with

DE borderline personality disorder; psychodynamic psychotherapy;
   psychotherapy-methods
AB There are very few studies on the changes in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) treated with psychodynamic psychotherapy, around the world, and as far as we know, this is the first report in Mexico on this subject. The main features of this disorder appear at 18 years of age (75% females; 25% males) and are frequent crises characterized by impulsivity (physical figths, substance abuse, suicide or self-mutilating behavior), affective instability (episodes of depression, anxiety and anger) and alterations in identity (sudden changes in values, vocational or laboral goals) that consume a lot of health resources and contribute to many failures in academic and work performance. Its treatment always needs some form of individual or group psychotherapy, with medication at times. In most of the clinical settings this disorder is considered as untractable or to take years to produce beneficial modifications. According to the epidemiological studies of several countries, this disorder appears in 1.1 to 4.6% in the general population, in 10% of the patients in ambulatory mental health centers, in 20% of the hospitalized psychiatric patients and in 30 to 60% of the patients with personality disorders. In a clinical psychiatric population in the Central Military Hospital (Mexico City) the prevalence was 35.7%. This paper reports changes observed in the psychopathology of borderline personality disorder treated by therapists trained in the Kernberg's manualized psychodynamic psychotherapy, delivered in two weekly 45 minutes sessions, videorecorded and supervised once a week by experts. As for the therapists that participated in the study, four were psychoanalysts with a mean experience of 12 years (D.E. = 1.15) and 10 psychotherapists with a mean experience of 4.67 years (D.E. = 4.23). The experience of both groups of therapists was significately different (U = 7.5, p<.002), Nineteen patients were treated: four males and 15 females who met the DSM IV borderline personality disorder criteria. Measurements of the psychopathology and global functioning were made at the beginning of the treatment. and every 24 sessions during a two years period, using the Clarkin's Dimensional Scale of the DSM IV Borderline Personality Disorder, and the DSM IV Global Assessment of Functioning. The results were: a) Eleven patients no longer met the DSM IV borderline personality disorder criteria at the 72(nd) session measurement, b) there was a positive change in the severity of the psychopathology in all criteria along time, c) the impulsivity criteria disappeared at the 24(th) session evaluation; affective instability criteria almost disappeared at the 48(th) session evaluation, while identity alterations criteria had only minimal changes even in those patients that remained in treatment for almost two years, d) the gaining in the Global Assessment of Functioning from the beginning to the 72(nd) session measurement was 70% and, f) there were no significative differences between the type of therapist and the improvement of the patient in the measurements. These results should be replicated and contrasted with randomized and comparative studies between this type of therapy and supportive psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy, group therapy and medication in patients of other social classes treated by residents in psychiatry and clinical psychologists before making available this therapy to a wider patients population.

AB Background: Although research conducted within the military has assessed the health and mental health problems of military personnel, little information exists about personnel who seek care outside the military. The purpose of this study is to clarify the personal characteristics, mental health diagnoses, and experiences of active duty U.S. military personnel who sought civilian sector services due to unmet needs for care. Materials and Methods: This prospective, multi-method study included 233 clients, based in the United States, Afghanistan, South Korea, and Germany, who obtained care between 2013 and 2016 from a nationwide network of volunteer civilian practitioners. A hotline organized by faith-based and peace organizations received calls from clients and referred them to the network when the clients described unmet needs for physical or mental health services. Intake and follow-up interviews at 2 wk and 2 mo after intake captured demographic characteristics, mental health diagnoses, and reasons for seeking civilian rather than military care. Non-parametric bootstrap regression analyses identified predictors of psychiatric disorders, suicidality, and absence without leave (AWOL). Qualitative analyses of clients' narratives clarified their experiences and reasons for seeking care. The research protocol has been reviewed and approved annually by the Institutional Review Board at the University of New Mexico. Results: Depression (72%), post-traumatic stress disorder (62%), alcohol use disorder (27%), and panic disorder (25%) were the most common diagnoses. Forty-eight percent of clients reported suicidal ideation. Twenty percent were absence without leave. Combat trauma predicted post-traumatic stress disorder (odds ratio [OR] = 8.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.66, 47.12, p = 0.01) and absence without leave (OR = 3.85, 95% CI 1.14, 12.94, p = 0.03). Non-combat trauma predicted panic disorder (OR = 3.64, 95% CI 1.29, 10.23, p = 0.01). Geographical region was associated with generalized anxiety disorder (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49, 0.99, p = 0.05). Significant predictors were not found for major depression, alcohol use disorder, or suicidal ideation. Clients' narrative themes included fear of reprisal for seeking services, mistrust of command, insufficient and unresponsive services, cost as a barrier to care, deception in recruitment, voluntary enlistment remorse, guilt about actual or potential killing of combatants or non-combatant civilians, preexisting mental health disorders, family and household challenges that contributed to distress, and military sexual trauma. Conclusions: Our work clarified substantial unmet needs for services among active duty military personnel, the limitations of programs based in the military sector, and the potential value of civilian sector services that are not linked to military goals. We and our institutional review board opted against using a control group that would create ethical problems stemming from the denial of needed services. For future research, an evaluative strategy that can assess the impact of civilian services and that reconciles ethical concerns with study design remains a challenge. Due to inherent contradictions in the roles of military professionals, especially the double agency that makes professionals responsible to both clients and the military command, the policy alternative of providing services for military personnel in the civilian sector warrants serious consideration, as do preventive strategies such as non-military alternatives to conflict resolution.

AB Currently mental health risks represent one of the most important collective health problems. Their increasing trend in the last decades, as well as the changes in population structures indicate that mental diseases will be one of the main causes of morbidity in Mexico. The study of the relationship between social conditions and the health-illness process has been consolidated as a broad scientific field capable of contributing elements towards prevention and treatment. Different studies have reported that there is a relationship between industrialization processes, urbanization and the apparition and increase of mental diseases. At the same time, it has been documented that mental diseases are differentially distributed among the population and this is associated with specific conditions such as social class, occupation or gender.
   The purpose of the present study, lies in the last category. To describe gender differences in a psychiatric hospital in Mexico City, the clinical records of patients admitted for the first time at the emergency room of the hospital between 1993 and 1995 were revised. In this population a frequency analysis was carried out and tests of statistical significance were performed.
   In each case the corresponding record was revised and the socioeconomic data and diagnosis were recorded, as well as its respective coding according to the International Classification of Diseases, ninth version (CIE-9). Globally there were 1083 admissions of Federal District residents, among which 52% were women and 48% were men; the age limits were from 14 to 93 years. Four intervals were defined: 25 years old or less, from 26 to 40 years, from 41 to 60 years, 61 years or more. The age-groups more numerous were those from 26 to 40 years (38.4%) and from 41 to 60 years (31.1%). The average age among men was 40.3 years and among women 42.2 years, these differences were statistically significant (t = -2.00,p = 0.045).
   The changes with age and their contributions towards the make-up of each disease were later analyzed. This was done separately for men and women. To evaluate differences between groups regarding the percentage contribution of different diagnoses to the number of total cases, the X-2 test was performed, with a statistical significance of alpha = 0.05.
   From 30 codes comprising the mental diseases chapter of CIE-9 (chapter V), among the studied population 25 codes were found, one belonged to another chapter (suicidal attempts and ideas). The diagnoses contributing more cases were: other organic psychoses (CIE 294, 176 cases), schizophrenic psychoses (CIE 295, 149 cases), transitory organic psychoses (CIE 293, 112 cases) and neurotic disorders (CIE 300, 98 cases), these as a whole constituted 49.4% of the total cases. It was found that other less frequent diseases contributed significantly to the total, such as: suicidal attempt (CIE E-950, 95 cases), alcohol-dependence syndrome (CIE 303, 93 cases) and unclassified depressive disorder (CIE 311, 77 cases). These three diseases made up 24.5% of the total. In both men and women, "other organic psychoses" was the diagnosis contributing most of the cases (17.1% and 15.4%, respectively). Sex differences were found practically among all disorders, even though their magnitude varied according to the age groups. The specific mental disorder profiles for men and women can be configured using those diagnoses whose gender difference was more significant.
   The profile for the female gender was different compared to that of men. Women contributed more cases in the following diagnoses: neurotic diseases (5.0% men and 13.5% women), suicidal attempt and ideas (7.1% men and 10.6% women), unclassified depressive disorder (4.4% men and 10.0% women), affective psychoses (2.5% men and 5.0% women) and other non-organic psychoses (0.2% men and 1.9% women). A striking difference was observed in neurotic diseases (CIE 300), which among women occupies the second place, while among men holds the seventh place.
   Meanwhile, the profile for the male gender was characterized by a greater contribution of men in the following diagnoses: alcohol-dependence syndrome (15.1% men and 1.5% women), drug dependency (7.6% men and 1.0% women) and alcoholic psychoses (3.0% men and 0.4% women). It is noteworthy that among men these diagnoses occupied places 3,5, and 9, respectively, whereas among women they were placed in ranks 13, 16 and 18, respectively.
   The above posed the need to perform an analysis from the gender perspective, in order to gain insight into gender Specificity for certain mental disorders. To do this the description of socialization patterns was proposed because they explain richly the modalities with which men and women manifest psychological disturbances. As a result of this analysis it was found out that the general features of gender socialization correlate strongly with the signs and symptoms conforming the psychopathology of the pathological profiles by gender.
   The findings of this study confirm that social relationships correlate with the population profiles of mental disorders. However, to corroborate the association between processes of a social nature and the type of mental disease manifested by individuals as a function of gender, it is necessary to perform accompanying studies that calculate measures of relative risk.

   DEPRESSION; DEFICITS
AB Evidence from recent studies about the epidemiology of panic disorder (PD) indicates that it is present in 4.7% of general population. In Mexico City, 2.9% of females and 1.9% of males are affected by this disease. Due to the incidence cited above, it is considered on important mental health problem that has impacted social, labor and familiar areas.
   On the other hand, PD is frequently present in comorbidity with other disorders like major depression, social phobia and generalized anxiety disorder. Moreover, in some cases, it may lead to a suicide risk.
   PD is characterized by recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, and is commonly associated with agoraphobia. A panic attack is defined as a discrete period of fear or discomfort that includes physical, cognitive and behavioral symptoms. Physical symptoms comprise short breath, palpitations, sweating, dizziness, gastrointestinal discomfort, and chest pain. Cognitive symptoms are associated with catastrophic interpretation of bodily sensations; behavioral symptoms are mainly avoidant of different places, situations and actions that patient had associated with fear of loss of control.
   In the past few years there has been a growing interest in the neuropsychology of anxiety disorders. Neuropsychological evaluation is relevant because it implies an objective assessment of the cognitive and behavioral abilities and weaknesses that make possible the prediction of the course of the disorder and the effects of treatment modalities.
   One of the most important contributions of neuropsychological evaluation is the identification of stable patterns of cognitive profiles of a specific disorder considered as neurocognitive endophenotypes.
   Some recent studies have demonstrated the relationship between neuropsychological alterations and anxiety; nevertheless, most of them were observed in obsessive-compulsive disorder patients. On the other hand, studies examining neuropsychological functioning in PD patients are scarce and report conflicting results.
   The main objective of the present study was to evaluate whether PD patients with and without agoraphobia, who attended the National Institute of Psychiatry "Ramon de la Fuente" in Mexico City, showed neuropsychological impairments relative to healthy controls in attention, memory and executive functions.
   We studied a total sample of 48 subjects (24 patients with PD, the patients sample was selected according to a psychiatric evaluation, based on DSM-IV-TR criteria. Inclusion criteria were age between 19 Articulo original and 56, men or women, without previous pharmacological or psychotherapeutically treatment; and 24 gender, age and education matched healthy control subjects). A neuropsychological test battery (Neuropsi Attention and Memory) in Spanish with norms by age and educational level was administered. The Neuropsi assesses orientation, attention and concentration, executive functions, working memory and immediate and delayed verbal and visual memory.
   Likewise, all patients were assessed with the Anxiety Sensitivity Index, Beck's Anxiety Inventory and Panic Disorder Severity Scale. According to this psychometric evaluation, the PD patients showed severe anxiety, high anxiety sensitivity, as well as a severe degree of panic symptoms.
   The differences between PD patients and control subjects in neuropsychological performance were determined through one way analysis of variance (p < 0.05) with the assistance of the SPSS 12.
   The results of the present study indicate that the neuropsychological test performance of patients with PD is diminished relative to that of the health control.
   According to obtained results, there were significant differences in the total score of executive functions and attention, memory and global attention and memory between patients and healthy controls.
   In the analysis of different subscales, it was found that patients had reduced performance in visual search, digit backward span, world list free recall, Rey-Ostereith Complex Figure Test encoding and retrieval, word list cued recall, faces retrieval and in diverse executive functions like category formation test, semantic and phonological verbal fluency, as well as design fluency.
   This suggests that PD is associated with alterations in tasks that require flexibility in the mental processes, short-term memory, working memory, and in the generation of strategies to solve problems. However, it is possible that these alterations were present before the onset of panic disorder and predispose the ulterior development of this disorder.
   In the visual detection subscale, that evaluates selective attention, there were also differences in latency of response because patients were slower than healthy controls trying to find the correct figure. This deficiency is associated with the difficulty of PD patients to perceive important details of the environment due to the extreme attention in the corporal sensations.
   Besides, no group differences were found in orientation, attention and concentration.
   These findings are consistent with previous studies with PD patients, where impairments in verbal memory, executive functions and visuospatial memory were found. Nevertheless, these findings differ from the reported by others studies, where neuropsychological alterations in PD patients were found.
   These discrepancies could be due to methodological procedures in the sample selection, pharmacological treatment, intensity of anxiety, and the use of different neuropsychological instruments.
   In the present study, the clinical sample was characterized by absence of pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments before neuropsychological evaluation was done with the Neuropsi.
   A notable finding was that, in the face recognition subscale, patients had better scores than controls. This can be related to a previous reported finding, which suggested that PD patients pay more attention to the details of a face to evaluate if these are safe or unsafe before the possibility of having a panic attack. Also, it is possible to consider it like an special ability developed by these patients as a compensatory behavior before the disability caused by this disorder and the vulnerability they experience when not having control of their symptoms.
   In conclusion, we have demonstrated deficits in the visuospatial and verbal memory, and executive functions in PD patients. This finding supported a disturbance in the amygdaline fronto-temporal neural network in the disorder, related in the conditioned fear network involved in the etiology of panic disorder.
   Future neuropsychological studies will benefit from use of neuroimaging studies to examine pattern of brain activation and elucidate the pathophysiology features of the disorder. As well as determine whether cognitive performance varies as a function of severity of panic symptoms.

TI Adaptation of a model of cognitive-behavioral intervention for dependent

ID COMMUNITY-REINFORCEMENT APPROACH; PROBLEM DRINKERS; ABUSE; CONSUMPTION;
   PREVENTION; TRIAL
AB The chronical abuse of addictive substances is a major public health problem, due to the seriousness of the consequences: fatal automobile accidents or others involving traumatic injury and emergency medical care, chronic physical diseases such as cirrhosis of the liver, cardiovascular complaints, cerebrovascular problems and pancreatitis, as well as disability and disruption in different functional areas of daily life, whether social, psychological, legal, personal, family, economic or professional. These factors include: depression, anxiety, loss of sleep, loss of support networks, suicide, violence, injury in fights, homicide, financial debt, divorce, loss of employment, hospitalization, crime and imprisonment, among other.
   It is therefore required to establish multidisciplinary intervention models that respond to the seriousness of the problem. In Mexico, reports show that there is a need for the development of more intervention models for chronic users of addictive substances, which include systematic implementation and evaluation as well as medium- and long-term measurements to asses effectiveness. Intervention services often do not go beyond support for the initial detoxification. Additionally, the high cost of most treatment schemes makes them inaccessible to the majority of the people affects by these problems.
   Intervention models must be designed and developed to include elements from other models that have proven to be reliable and effective on the basis of empirical evidence.
   The Community Reinforcement Approach or "CRA" intervention model has gained recognition in scientific literature and from international institutions (the National Institute of Drug Addiction, NIDA, and the National Institute of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse, NIAAA) as one of the most effective means in reducing consumption by chronic users of addictive substances.
   Consequently, the objective of this research was to use a pilot project to adapt, systemize, implement and assess the impact of the Community Reinforcement Approach intervention model in reducing consumption patterns among chronic dependent users of alcohol and other drugs within the Mexican population.
   A cognitive-behavioral intervention model was applied to 9 chronic users who had requested psychological help at the Psychological Service Centers of the Faculty of Psychology. The average age of the users was 35. Seven of them were male and two female. The most commonly consumed addictive substance was alcohol by six users, with other drugs accounting for three (benzodiazepine, marihuana, cacaine, solvents and amphetamines). On average, the subjects had spent 14 years in schooling. Five of them were single, one was married, on cohabiting and two divorced. With regard to the occupations of the sample, one was a student, two had abandoned a course of study, four were employed before treatment and two were unemployed.
   The criteria that the users had to meet for inclusions in the study were: to be aged 18 or over; to be able to read and write; to have a medium-to-severe level of alcohol dependence corresponding to a range between 22 and 47 points on the Alcohol Dependence Scale (ADS) and/or a substantial-to-severe level of dependence on other drugs of between 11 and 20 points according to the Drug Abuse Questionnaire (DAQ); to consume a quantity of 14 or more measures of alcohol per occasion and/or 20 or more measures per week for men, and 10 or more per occasion or 15 or more per week for women; to have been treated or interned on at least one previous occasion; to suffer consumption-related difficulties in different areas of daily life.
   The duration of the treatment period was from 15 to 24 sessions, depending on the specific training needs of each user. Sessions lasted 1(1)/(2) hours, and were given twice a week. The methodology used was single case with repetitions and follow-up.
   The cognitive-behavioral model included the following intervention components: Functional Analysis, Demonstration of Non-Consumption, Daily Life Goals, Communication, Problem Solving, Consumption Refusal, Marriage Guidance, Employment Searches, Recreational and Social Skills and Prevention of Relapses. The didactic techniques used in the training for each of the aforementioned components were: verbal instruction, modeling, behavioral trials and feedback.
   The original model (CRA) was adapted to include the following changes: 1) More communication skills were integrated, including listening, starting conversations, giving and receiving criticism, giving and receiving recognition, and sharing positive and negative feelings; 2) Relapse prediction variables were assessed: self-effectiveness and triggers; 3) New skills for refusing consumption were added: interrupting interaction, justification for non-consumption.
   Occurrence records were kept for the application in natural settings of the skills taught. In addition, teaching materials were prepared, along with information brochures on different addictive substances and the different training components, lists of community resources and therapist checklists to guarantee the systematic implementation of the model.
   The pre-post-test evaluation methods were: Retrospective Baseline (RETBAS), Self-Recording, Situational Confidence Scale and/or Drug Consumption Self-Confidence Scale, Daily Life General Satisfaction Scale, Inventories of Drug Consumption Situation and/or Inventories of Alcohol Consumption Situations.
   The significant changes identified in this preliminary research were: decreases in consumption patterns during and after treatment, since in the pre-post-test statistical analysis for paired samples the results t= 4.75 p=.001 were obtained in the comparison of baseline and treatment, and t= 4.28 p=.002 in the comparison of the baseline and follow-up; increases in the levels of general satisfaction in daily life following treatment and during follow-up, since in the pre-post-test statistical analysis for paired samples the results t=-3.94 and p=.004 were obtained, and t=-4.03 and p=.004 in the pre-follow-up comparison; increases in levels of self-effectiveness after treatment and during follow-up, since in the pre-post-test statistical analysis for paired samples the results t=-5.08 and p=.001 were obtained, and t=-4.37 and p=.002 in the pre-follow-up comparison; decrease in the number of consumption triggers after treatment and during follow-up, since in the pre-post-test statistical analysis for paired samples the results t=5.80 and p=.000 were obtained, and t=5.3 and p=.001 in the pre-follow-up comparison.
   As a result of the foregoing, the researchers were able to verify the effectiveness of the intervention model in significantly reducing consumption patterns in nine chronic dependent users of addictive substances. Similarly, the model had a significant impact on consumption prediction variables, as well as increasing self-effectiveness levels and eliminating triggers to avoid relapses. Users learnt how to create a more satisfying day-to-day lifestyle, by including activities incompatible with consumption.
   Finally, in repetitions of the implementation of this intervention model, it is recommended that a training component be introduced for emotion management (Depression, anxiety and anger), as well as an assessment of cognitive functioning as a relapse prediction variable, and the participation of users that have been part of a social-recreational activity group to reinforce sustained abstinence in the long term.

TI Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Pediatric Bipolar Disorder,
   comorbidity or overlap?: A review.: Part one
SO SALUD MENTAL
LA Spanish
DT Article
DE attention and hyperactivity disorder; pediatric bipolar disorder;
   comorbidity
AB Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can present itself with a wide variety of comorbid psychiatric entities and can easily be misdiagnosed with disorders such as the pediatric bipolar disorder (PedBP), making early detection and treatment difficult.
   The main objective of this review is to evaluate the relationship between PedBP and ADHD. Several studies have addressed this association, establishing a high rate of comorbidity, from 57% to 93%. The risk of developing PedBP in ADHD population has also been studied, documenting a ten-fold increase risk in both genders compared with age-matched healthy controls.
   Pediatric bipolar disorder is still a diagnostic entity which is hard to recognize and differentiate from other disorders, even with the current international diagnostic criteria. Individuals with ADHD with a current depressive episode, suicide attempts and/or substance abuse and that carry a family load (mainly parents) for bipolar disorder are at increased risk of actually having this disorder.
   Several researchers have compared clinical symptoms expressed in children with ADHD and PedBP They have found that children with PebBP exhibit higher frequency of elated mood, increased energy, thought disorder, flight of ideas, increased speed in speech and irritability than those with ADHD. Other authors report higher rates of thought disorders, anxiety, depression, aggression and delinquent behavior amongst children with PedBP than those with ADHD. If has also been reported that children with PedBP compared to those with ADHD present higher rates of euphoria, grandiosity, racing thoughts and decreased need for sleep. Yet another study found that euphoria and increased energy distinguished youths with PedBP from those with other psychiatric disorders, and found that with the group of depressed patients exhibit higher rates of suicidal thoughts and behavior than other diagnostic groups.
   Some cues to diagnose and differentiate PedBP and ADHD have been proposed: ADHD symptoms appearing suddenly or later in life, loss of therapeutic response to stimulants in a previous responder, intermittent symptoms, emergence Of elated mood and decreased need for sleep, severe mood shifting, hallucinations or thought disorders, family history of bipolar disorder and lack of response to adequate treatment.
   Three of the seven criteria for bipolar disorder are shared with ADHD (distractibility increased goal directed activity and talkativeness), making the clinical distinction between ADHD and early onset PedBP a difficult task. In fact, most children diagnosed with PedBP present symptoms and behavior compatible with a simultaneous ADHD.
   The role of ADHD as a prodromic, phenocopy, comorbid condition and/or as a misdiagnosis for PedBP can be further clarified by: 1. case follow-up to determine if comorbid diagnosis can predict the course or determine a prognosis factor; and 2. family genetic studies which are convenient for the evaluation of complex comorbid conditions. Some studies have suggested that this comorbid syndrome may possess a specific genotype, as well a particular course, a pattern of treatment response and may represent a distinctive clinical condition.
   High comorbidity BPD, both in adult and child and adolescent populations, runs a similar pattern to that of other important diagnostic categories in child and adolescent psychiatry. From a clinical perspective, these findings support the notion of avoiding hierarchical diagnoses. Furthermore, it questions the vision of categorical entities as it is proposed in the current diagnostic classification (ICD and DSM).
   Currently, when we talk about ADHD, we cannot separate it from other disruptive behavior disorders, such as conduct disorder (CD) and oppositional-defiant disorder (ODD). Epidemiological studies show that 40% to 70% of children with ADHD have CD or ODD, and some of them also present comorbid internalizing disorders.
   There is a clear possibility of a diagnostic confussion between PedBP and disruptive behavior disorders. Certain behavioral signals can indicate whether a child has a PedBP and/or a ODD or CD.
   The role sequential or concurrent comorbidity plays on neuropsychological profiles or neuroanatomy of bipolar disorder and ADHD remains unclear. Independent reports indicate an overlap of the neural circuits implicated on both disorders. Apparently, there is an overlap of impairments in ADHD children with and without PedBP involving motor inhibitory control, sustained attention, verbal learning, working memory, planning, and visual and motor skills.
   In addittion, to making both the early detection and diagnosis more difficult, comorbidity between ADHD and PedBP in the clinical setting complicates pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatment.
   Pharmacologically, some studies have suggested that stimulant use may be safe and effective in children with manic symptoms and ADHD. Other reports argue against their use, hence these findings are not conclusive. An alternative for the pharmacological management of the ADHD/PedBP comorbidity is the use of atomoxetine, although there are no randomized, double blind or clinical controlled trials to support its use.
   It has been reported that BP and ADHD comorbidity may predict a lack of response to lithium pharmocotherapy in adolescents. Few studies have the addressed response to divalproex with this comorbidity. Data also suggest a lack of response in manic phases to usual pharmacotherapy in bipolar patients with a history of ADHD. These data stress the importance of the detection of comorbid ADHD (active or in remission) for prognostic and therapeutic planning. Furthermore, it is necessary to research on novel treatment modalities to specifically address the comorbid condition.
   In our country, efforts have been made to address the ADHD-PedBP comorbidity. One example is the treatment algorithm for ADHD and PedBP proposed by the Second Expert Consensus on the management of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity disorder, an effort made towards adapting the available evidence and treatment options for our population. The algorithm establishes that at STAGE 0 the crucial aspect is early detection. Bipolar disorder should be addressed first and it ought to be done by a specialist.
   Some important points in STAGE 1 are: 1. first treatment option should be a stimulant (in Mexico, immediate and controlled release methylphenidate) plus a mood stabilizer; 2. in the case of a lack of response to two different stimulants, atomoxetine or bupropion should be considered; 3. as a last option, atypical antipsychotics like risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine and aripiprazole are proposed. it also mentions the ever frequent need for combined therapy and dynamic modifications in treatment sequences.
   Conclusions
   ADHD and PedBP disorder are highly comorbid. The similarities between the clinical features of these entities often make diagnosis a challenge for clinicians and carries several treatment considerations.
   In accordance to international research and national efforts to establish treatment options, stimulants may be considered a first line option for ADHD/BP comorbidity with the addition of a mood stabilizer. Although in general stimulants may be benefitial to many patients with both ADHD and BP, a group of patients may not tolerate their use, mainly due to side effects or mood destabilization. To offer a better treatment option for these patients it is crucial to continue in the search for other therapeutic modalities in order to improve residual symptoms in attention and cognition, even when the affective symptoms have resided.

TI Experiences of physical violence experted by their partner of women in
   prison.
SO SALUD MENTAL
LA Spanish
DT Article
DE violence; women; prison
AB Violence against women is an everyday problem which is expressed in various ways, whether physically, sexually or emotionally, and it may occur at either public or private level. The subject of violence against women has been regarded as a worldwide priority, since it obstructs every area of women's development. Society has acknowledged the fact that this violence "prevents the achievement of the objectives of equality, development and peace and that it violates, reduces or prevents (women's) enjoyment of human rights and fundamental liberties.
   A recent report by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and the Center for Health and Gender Equity shows that at least one out of every three women has been physically mistreated, forced to engage in sexual relations or suffered some type of abuse in the course of their lives.
   In Mexico as in other countries, violent behavior has been regarded as "natural" in relation to the way how to treat women; norms and everyday life have kept it hidden. Epidemiological surveys, however, show figures that reflect the scope of the problem which in turn has meant that it is now considered as a serious health problem. Consequently, approaching the issue of intra-familial violence compels one to consider a characteristic cultural aspect: the questionable fact of referring to its existence solely within the private sphere. It is felt that what goes on inside a home is an intimate affair and that outsiders should not be aware of this, far less intervene. The same happens when one discusses the violence experienced by women Living in prison, since they often continue to experience violence or abuse when they receive their conjugal visits; or else at the hands of other prisoners or from the institute itself and no-one seems willing to intervene.
   Women living in a penitentiary environment designed essentially for men, occupy a secondary position and are marginalized as regards planned work, cultural, sports, and recreational programs, partly due to the fact that the prison population is thought to be primarily male (1990 to 1994 reports).
   As Barquin notes, most women in prison experienced violence from their parents or witnessed their mothers being mistreated, and therefore became used to this type of behavior and more tolerant of it. This does not mean that these experiences should be regarded as the reason why women commit a crime or the main cause why they were admitted to the penal system. The cycle of violence that begins in the family is perpetuated in marriage and would appear to be completed in prisons, recommencing when women are released from prison. Being deprived of freedom as a result of imprisonment, together with the abuse that take place in jail appear to be a further link in the chain of multiple types of violence which constitute the path for some part of this population.
   Human Rights Watch is an organization that has undertaken specialized research in prisons since 1987 and in its 1988 report points out that Venezuelan prisons housed a total population of 25381 individuals, 4% of which were women.
   This same source reported that drug-related crimes led to a 55% increase in the jail population. In 1991, the percentage of female prisoners held in US state prisons for violent crimes was 32.2%, although that the majority had been imprisoned for nonviolent crimes. Donzinger points out that the majority of women prisoners that had been sentenced for the murder of someone close to them had been victims of mistreatment or sexual abuse at some time in their lives, and thus violence against women should become an important issue for the authorities, as it is one of the most outstanding problems that reflects the current situation of the living conditions in prison centers.
   Given the importance that has violence against women in general, and the lack of statistical indicators on the issue of women in prison, the main objective of this paper was to describe the types of physical violence exercised by the partners of 213 women, interviewed at a Preventive Center and at Social Re-adaptation Center, in order to determine the scope of the problem and to propose intervention strategies. A non-probabilistic sample of 213 women, selected for reasons of convenience, was used.
   A specially designed instrument was used, consisting of a semi-structured interview with 242 questions, covering the following areas of the lives of the women inter-viewed: demographic data, school history, current family, family of origin, legal status, previous history of imprisonment, work experience, social networks depression, suicide risk, anguish, alcohol consumption variables, alcohol consumption measurement, variables for measuring the use of medical and non-medical drugs, scale of motives for consumption, treatment barriers, intimate relationships and sexuality, sexual abuse, violence/victimization, criminal violence, post-traumatic stress, prison environment, general health, and life styles and impulsiveness.
   The most important demographic characteristics of women found were: most were in the group aged from 28 to 40 year (45.5%), had six years or less of schooling (41.3%), secondary school (36.2%) and high school or technical college (16.4%) and were single (48.6%) or living with their partners (21.6%) while 50.7% had children under the age of 18.
   Of the 213 women interviewed, only 161 reported having suffered violence at the hands of their partners; 29.2% had experienced 1 to 5 acts, 23.4% had experienced 6 to 10, and 23.4% had been the object of 11 to 17 acts of violence.
   Statistics presented in this article in various research studies on family violence in most countries only show a small part of all the violence produced in families, and the results found in this research show that violence is higher among the group of female prisoners.
   One should not forget that prison reflects an exercise of the system that performs a marginalizing function, as it includes the poorest women from the most disadvantaged sectors, with low educational level. As Lima suggests, women are doubly stigmatized in prison, as they suffer first as women and second as criminals, not only because they belong to an underprivileged group in every social aspect, but because they belong to die group that has violated the classic image of women imposed by society, a fact for which they are severely punished, while the violence and abuse they have suffered is ignored.

AB Throughout its history, one of the most fascinating topics of psychiatry has been that of the causes and consequences of mental disorders. The desire to strengthen the reliability of diagnosis in this area has led to significant advances in two important fields: psychopathological description and the formulation of an integral diagnosis. Classifications allow the definition of categories and in the case of the two most read taxonomies in the field of mental health, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), these provide the most commonly used criteria for diagnosis. The revised fourth edition of the DSM is now insufficient to cover the ever greater clinical challenges and research. For over ten years, work has been carried out on the structure of DSM-V (the fifth edition), but despite the planning, organization, prediction, and the contributions of guest experts, it is feared that all the requirements of modern psychiatry will not be met. The first edition of DSM was published in the 1950s. It was based on the terminology developed by William Meninger. This version of the manual and the following, published several years later, reflected the psychodynamic psychiatry which prevailed at the time. The third edition was published in 1980 and its revised edition seven years later. The emphasis here was on descriptive and syndromatic considerations. The fourth edition appeared several years later. The most striking change in this edition was the inclusion of variables resulting from empirical studies. A later edition was published in the year 2000.
   The first attempts to put together DSM-V started in 1999. From 1999 until 2007 work was done on the planning of the investigation and technical documentation of DSM-V and the inclusion of the so called investigation schedules. The second phase of the project, known as the refinement of the research program for DSM-V, was carried out between 2004 and 2007. A pilot test was undertaken between January and May 2010, among different segments of the population and different settings, to evaluate the revisions proposed by the working teams. Between March and April 2011, as a result of the field tests, the proposed criteria for diagnosis were reviewed. The dimensional measurements and the criteria for diagnosis will be reviewed again during the rest of 2011. The year 2012 will see the preparation of the final version of the text, and finally, in May 2013, DSM-V will be presented at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association in San Francisco, California.
   Several external and independent authors have offered numerous proposals on topics related to psychopathology in general to the working groups formed for the preparation of DSM-V. Only some of these are mentioned below. One of the first factors to be taken into consideration in the revision of the manual is the need to distinguish between empirical questions or approaches and those of a more conceptual or philosophical nature, which should, by no means, be excluded. Another point to be evaluated is the advisability of defining phases according to the development of the condition, which would ideally create a schema focused on prevention. One of the expectations of psychiatry is that eventually laboratory criteria of diagnosis could be established, which could be measurable and would lead to clear statistics of psychiatric pathologies. As far as somatomorphic disorders are concerned, many practitioners agree that the current terminology and the systems of classification are inaccurate. One proposal is that this category should be eliminated altogether and that diagnoses should be made using an additional multidimensional description. One of the most interesting features of DSM is that it has had to accommodate changes brought about by new technologies. These advances go hand in hand with a new series of pathologies which need to be classified, as is the addiction to Internet.
   Undoubtedly, one of the greatest dilemmas facing DSM is how to classify eating disorders, as many people feel that the rather simplistic distinction between nervous anorexia and bulimia is not altogether convincing. There are two interesting proposals to consider in DSM-V: one is known as night eater syndrome and obesity, as in this case there is a compulsive consumption of food and an inability to limit this intake, in spite of a desire to do so. With regard to the compulsive, obsessive disorder, most experts believe that it is necessary to see the disorder as a spectrum, but defining criteria. Undeniably, a grave current problem which makes no distinctions is suicide. Different researchers recommend that suicidal behavior be considered and documented as a separate diagnosis in a sixth axis of the multioxis schema. Another important aspect concerns the giving of quality attention to patients. This has led to the proposal to expand DSM-V to include indicators for situations which could eventually be a cause for treatment. The proposal is to structure something different from what can be found in axis IV. In the case of paraphilias, it is deemed necessary that DSM-V should deal not only with the strictly descriptive aspect, but also with the semantic and linguistic. The importance of post-traumatic stress has been described, but there exists the doubt whether it is necessary to experience an adverse incident for this to be triggered. There has been a suggestion that the term "pre-traumatic" stress disorder be included in DSM-V to diagnose this condition. In the case of anxiety disorders, some authors advise the creation of a category known as "disorders caused by stress and fear", which would allow linking the diagnostic classification with etiology and thus define a "true" anxiety nosology. It would be advisable that the DSM-V included a category for "seasonal affective disorder" as such, and not simply as a variant in the "specification of the seasonal pattern" of depression. In the field of substance consumption, it has been argued that it is necessary to establish a classification which is not only categoric but also dimensional so as to improve its taxonomic usefulness. The organization of mental disorders in DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 (tenth edition) is complex and this has led to exploring the feasibility of developing a meta-structural system of classification based on risk and clinical factors. For disorders originated in infancy, childhood and adolescence, it has been suggested that the disorder known as "temperament disorder by disphoria" be included in the forthcoming taxonomy, as well as the use of the terms insensitive/emotionless for behavioral disorders, among others. In the case of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the current criteria are considered insufficient and it has been suggested that the starting age for this disorder be increased from 7 to 12 years of age. It is suggested that autism be considered autistic spectrum, thus eliminating the other disorders covered in this section, including Asperger syndrome.
   The question as to whether this taxonomic-diagnostic system, to be implemented world-wide, will be both valid and reliable enough to cover all variations and particular characteristics of different cultures, ethnic groups, social groups and geographical regions in Mexico is another matter of concern, due to the lack of tools available for daily clinical work, except for the International Classification of Diseases of the World Health Organization. There are, at present, a number of doubts and queries which will need to be laid open and evaluated in all seriousness in order to obtain concrete and integral answers, given that the manual will continue to be used for clinical purposes in different parts of the world. The challenge will be to find the best way to apply diagnostic criteria, avoiding omissions and oversimplifications and taking into account the cultural and social context worked in.

AB The objective of the study was to observe the changes in the psychopathology of women with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) after 48 sessions of Transference-Focused Psychotherapy (TFP) conducted by novel therapists, videotaped and supervised by experts. TFP is a specific treatment based on a manual, with two weekly individual sessions for BPD and also for the narcissistic and histrionic personality disorders. The treatment was developed in the last 20 years by Kernberg and colleagues at the Institute of Personality Disorders, Cornell Medical Center, according to the USA National Institute of Mental Health requirements.
   Transference-Focused Psychotherapy is important because it provides a systematic guide for the containment and analysis of the victim-victimizer and rescued-rescuer transference-countertransference paradigms that arise along the treatment sessions which, if not properly handled, are responsible for the failure of most treatments of BPD patients. Before starting TFP, a therapy contract is set with detailed prescriptions for the management of suicidal behavior (the patient must accept to self- contain suicidal urges in order to receive the treatment), other forms of impulsivity, affective instability and alterations of identity related to destructive decisions regarding leaving home, school or work, use of illegal and prescribed drugs and taking proper care of mental and physical comorbidities.
   Most BPD patients receive "treatment as usual" (TU) with supportive therapy, short and erratic courses of medication and brief hospitalizations. This is done despite the existence of specific therapies for them as psychodynamic therapy, supportive therapy, group therapy, family therapy and reliable and well- studied prolonged regimes of medications with fluvoxamine, olanzapine, valproate and omega fatty acid. Drop out rate of TU is almost 60% and the remaining patients exhibit little improvement even with several years of therapy conducted by experienced therapists.
   Specific therapies for BPD, besides TFP, are Linehan's Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) and Bateman and Fonagy's Partial Hospitalization (PH) treatment (these two treatments use a combination of individual and group therapies) and Stevenson and Meares's Self Psychotherapy (SP) (two individual sessions a week closely supervised in a weekly meeting with all therapists). These four therapies are effective for reducing the more destructive BPD manifestations within 12 to 18 months of treatment. Drop out rates are: PFT, 19.1%; DBT, 16.7%; PH, 12% and SP, 16%. In all these therapies, impulsivity and affective instability begin to remit after four to six months of treatment and the alterations of identity and the BPD diagnosis do not disappear at the end of the treatment.
   In a previous study carried out by some of us with experienced (mean experience, 12 years; S.D.=1.15) and novel therapists (mean experience, 4.67 years; S.D.=4.23), where the experience of each group was significatively different (U=7.5, p<.002), impulsivity remitted after 24 sessions and affective instability remitted almost completely after 48 sessions in 11 out of 19 patients of both sexes who were offered a two-year treatment with videorecorded supervised TFF. There were no differences in results between both groups of therapists.
   With that background, we planned the present study which, as far as we know, is the first TFP study with 48 sessions delivered only by novel therapists. The research project was approved by the Anahuac University research and ethical committees. Patients were recruited from. respondents to an offer of treatment for BPD at the university psychotherapy clinic. Selection of patients was made with clinical and semi-structured inter-views using the SCID I and the SCID II. At least one of the supervisors interviewed all patients and their families and offered to be available in the case of emergencies for patients, families and therapists. Inclusion criteria were: being 18 to 40 years old; meeting the first three criteria and two other of the remaining six BPD criteria; having graduated at least from junior high school, and not suffering from schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, delusional disorder, severe substance abuse, severe mental organic disorder or antisocial disorder.
   Therapists were selected among recent graduates from the Anahuac University psychotherapy post-graduate program after attending two semesters on BPD psychopathology and therapy and a 20-hours course on the treatment manual given by the supervisors. Seven therapists, six female and one male, agreed to participate. Supervisors were two training analysts from the Mexican Psychoanalytic Association, trained in the treatment manual by Kernberg and colleagues at the Institute of Personality Disorders, Cornell Medical Center, in 1993. Training analysts hold at least a yearly meeting with Kernberg's group in order to guarantee adherence to the manual.
   The supervisors have taught extensively how to use the treatment manual in Mexico City and other Mexican cities. The supervisors explained to the patients and their families the nature and procedures of the treatment. They also explained to them that the use of the videorecordings would be only for research purposes and asked patients to sign an informed consent letter. Fourteen patients agreed to initiate therapy Their mean age was 25 years, all of them were middle class and had a high education level. Nine had suicidal behavior and all suffered emotional outbursts and instability in vocational and value systems. All patients met criteria for BPD (1, 2, 3 and any two other of the remaining six), impulsivity (1 and 4 or 5), affective instability (2 and 6 or 8) and identity alterations (3 and 7 or 9). Four (29%) of them dropped out before reaching 24 sessions due to severe conflicts with parents and 10 completed 48 sessions.
   The manual used was Psychotherapy for Borderline Personality by Clarkin, Yeomans and Kernberg, a 370 pages text which contains a detailed theoretical and clinical presentation of the therapy aims, objectives, strategies, tactics, techniques, clinical assessment, therapy contract, phases of treatment and how to handle emergencies and comorbidities.
   Assessment evaluations were made at the time of entry, and after 24 and 48 sessions with the SCID 11 BPD section, the DSM IV Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF) and the SCL 90. These instruments have a good reliability and validity in measuring changes during psychotherapy Sessions were conducted in well adapted psychotherapy consulting rooms. Videorecordings were made having the vidoecamera inside the consulting room, handled by each therapist and always asking patients if they agreed with the procedure. All ten patients agreed in all sessions to do the videorecordings. Supervisions were carried out each week during three hours sessions attended by all therapists, the supervisors and the clinical coordinator of the psychotherapy program. All therapists showed a good adherence to the manual in the supervisory sessions and had no problems with being videorecorded.
   The following data analysis was made on the 10 patients who finished all 48 sessions. The three patients who attempted to commit suicide did not repeated attempts; the two patients with psychiatric hospitalizations no longer returned to hospital.
   At the end of 24 sessions, suicidal threats remitted in the nine patients who had them at the time of entry. Beside this, the seven patients who interrupted the attendance to school or work because of the BPD, reassumed their duties before ending the treatment.
   In the 24 sessions measurements, the following criteria were no longer met: impulsivity in nine patients, alterations of identity in three patients and affective instabilitv in two patients. In the 48 sessions measurements the following criteria were no longer met: impulsivity in one more patient; no other patients had changes in alterations of identity; six more patients in affective instability; and only one patient no longer met the required five criteria to make the BPD diagnosis.
   There were positive and significative differences in the SCL 90 and GAF measurements between the basal and the 24 and 48 sessions and in the GAF measurements between the 24 and 48 sessions, and almost significative differences in the SCL 90 measurements between the 24 and 48 sessions, as shown in the next values. Regarding the SCL 90, means were: initial: 2.14, S.D.=1.00; 24 sessions: 1.09, S.D.=0.84; 48 sessions: 0.67, S.D.=0.47. These decreasing values were significatives when comparing initial values with those obtained after 24 sessions (t=3.36, p=.01) and after 48 sessions (t=4.32, p=.002), and almost significative in the comparisons made between the 24 and the 48 sessions measurements (t=2.22, p=.054). When analyzing the GAF measurements, means were: initial: 37.10, S.D.=18.90; 24 sessions: 68.10, S.D.=11.28; 48 sessions: 86.00, S.D.=3.95). These increasing values were significative when comparing initial values with those from the 24 sessions (t=6.85, p=.00) and the 48 sessions (t=9.03, p=.00) measurements, and also when comparing the values from the 24 and the 48 sessions (t=6.02, P=.00).
   These results from the GAF and the SCL 90 show that the clinical and clinimetric improvement is corroborated with the measurements made by these two reliable instruments of change with psychotherapy.
   Because the main improvement was significative after the first 24 sessions, we think a 24-session treatment may be useful even for the most severe BPD manifestations.
   Our results were due to several factors: a) patients were young and educated; b) suicidal behavior was not severe; c) they had not suffered sexual abuse in infancy nor sexual violations in childhood or adolescence; d) they were treated by therapists trained with a treatment manual that emphasizes control of suicidal behavior, impulsivity and affective storms and the need to return soon to school and to work; e) all patients had psychological mindedness, genuine wishes to change and absence of huge secondary gains; f) supervisors interviewed all patients and families and were available to advice them and therapists. The only parent that asked for medical guidance and support was the mother of a patient who ingested caustics and had a gastrectomy immediately before starting treatment and, g) therapy was closely supervised using videotapes from the sessions.
   In comparing our results with those of the other specific treatments for BPD, we can see that our drop out rate was almost ten points higher than theirs, but still much more better that the 60% rate of the treatment as usual. The fact that the specific treatments studied, namely PFT, PS, DBT, PH and also the medications mentioned, had good results, speak of the need of designing a combined treatment that could be compared with the treatment as usual.
   The limitations of the study were that there was no control group, the short number of subjects and that they were only females. Conclusions are that TFP is effective to treat female subjects with suicidal and school and work dysfunction using novel therapists supervised by experts. There is a need to replicate this study with larger populations of both sexes in comparative studies with the treatment as usual.
