ID RISK
AB Background: The prevalence of suicide is increasing worldwide and nowadays approximately one million people commit suicide every year. In Slovenia, suicide is a major public health and social problem. Suicide rate in Slovenia is among the highest in Europe. Despite intensive research work on suicide in the countries with high suicide rates and despite all new data on risk factors, the suicide rates do not decline (with few exceptions). Nevertheless, suicide prevention is possible if it is based on research data and included in the National programme of suicide prevention.
   Conclusions: Slovenia being highly endangered by suicide, its Gorvernment should immediately nominate a working group which would prepare a National programme of suicide prevention.

AB Aim. To compare suicide rates in Australia, Slovenia, and Croatia with suicide rates in Croatian immigrant groups in Australia and Slovenia in a 10-year period.
   Method. We analyzed records for completed suicides of the residents of Australia in a decade between 1988 and 1997 and Croatia and Slovenia in a decade between 1985 and 1994. The Croatian Catholic Centers in Australia had 31 completed suicides reported in their Parish Registries in the decade between 1985 and 1994, In Slovenia, 141 completed suicides of Croats were reported in the same decade by the Institute of Public Health of Republic of Slovenia.
   Results. The suicide rate and method of suicide in the Croatian immigrant group in Slovenia (26.01/100,000/year; 60% of hanging) converged towards those of the host country (31.43/100,000/year; 76% of hanging), perhaps as a function of the years since migration from Croatia (22.53/100,000/year, 42% of hanging). Somewhat higher male-female ratio in this immigration group (3.55) could be explained by their lower social status. Surprisingly low suicide rate was calculated for the immigration group in Australia (3.10/100,000/year).
   Conclusion. Croat immigrants to Australia have the lowest suicide rate, but the highest male-female suicide ratio, which could be a consequence of underreporting of suicides by Croatian Catholic Centers in Australia. Different suicide data sources can be a source of significant bias in cross-cultural comparison of suicide behavior.

ID ALCOHOL
AB Background: With an average suicide rate of approximately 30 per 100,000, Slovenia has been regarded as a country with a high suicide rate. In the last decade, however, the suicide rate has gradually decreased to 20.3 per 100,000. Aim: To undertake an analysis of the suicide rate and its characteristics between 1997 and 2010 and to establish whether preventive activities had a significant effect on the suicide rate in the period studied. Method: Data on all 7,317 completed suicides between 1997 and 2010 were obtained from the National Mortality Database. Trends over this period were assessed separately for gender, age, method of suicide, and regional distribution. Data on implemented suicide preventive activities were assessed via regional Public Health Institutes. Results: The suicide rate declined in both genders and in all age groups, except in males aged 10-19 years. The most frequently used method in both genders was hanging. Regions with the highest suicide rate are concentrated in the eastern part of Slovenia. The suicide rate significantly decreased in six regions, but no firm association with preventive activities could be established. Conclusion: Suicide in Slovenia declined significantly during the study period. Preventive activities appear not to have had any notable effect on this decline.

DT Article
DE suicide; suicide attempt; prediction of suicide
ID PARASUICIDE
AB Objective: All suicide attempts cannot predict suicide, therefore we examined those characteristics of suicide attempt which could most accurately predict completed suicide.
   Subject and methods: Subjects were all individuals registered as committed suicides (N = 16,522) or attempted suicides (N = 15,057) in the register of suicides of the Republic of Slovenia between 1970 and 1996. Log linear analysis of a frequency table was used to uncover relationship between categorical variables.
   Results: The model we found fit between variables: mode, number of repetitions and type, then between number of repetitions, type and gender, and between mode, type and gender.
   Discussion: The risk of suicide in those who previously attempted suicide is approximately 773 times higher than the risk of suicide without a previous suicide attempt. Those who attempt suicide by hanging (hanging being in Slovenia the most frequent mode of completed suicide) are at even greater risk to commit suicide.
   Conclusion: Our data suggests that clinicians should heighten their awareness that any suicide attempt can in some 20% predict suicide. Someone who has attempted suicide by hanging is at the highest risk of suicide. (c) 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

TI Reduction in Suicide Mortality Following a New National Alcohol Policy
   in Slovenia: An Interrupted Time-Series Analysis
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
ID HEAVY DRINKING; CONSUMPTION; RUSSIA; HARM
AB Objectives. We assessed the impact on suicide mortality of a new national policy in Slovenia that limits the availability of alcohol.
   Methods. We obtained monthly total, male, and female suicide counts in Slovenia between January 1997 and December 2005 and then employed autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) techniques to model the effect of the alcohol policy (implemented in March 2003).
   Results. There was a significant decrease in the total number of monthly suicides following the policy's implementation. Subsequent analyses revealed this association to be caused solely by the impact on male suicides. Specifically, there was an immediate and permanent reduction of 3.6 male suicides per month (95% confidence interval = -0.4,-6.9), or approximately 10% of the preintervention average. The policy had no statistically significant effect on female suicides.
   Conclusions. Our results show the effectiveness of this specific policy in reducing male suicides in Slovenia and also hint at the potential of public policy in reducing the public health burden of alcohol-related harm more generally.

DT Article
ID IDEATION; OUTPATIENTS; POPULATION; BEHAVIOR
AB Background: Slovenia has been experiencing a very high suicide rate (30 per 10,000 inhabitants per year or higher) and there are no data on public attitudes towards suicide in Slovenia.
   Aims: To identify public attitudes towards suicide in order to expand the basis for prevention.
   Methods: A Suicide Attitudes Questionnaire (SUIATT) was sent to a representative sample of adult Slovenian citizens.
   Results: Some 5.2% of respondents had at least one previous suicidal attempt and 21.6% reported suicidal ideation (SI). More respondents with Si than respondents without SI reported: 1) the suicidal act as deliberated, 2) less importance attached to the mental illness in suicidal behaviour, 3) that a person has the right to commit suicide, and 4) the suicidal act as an act of cowardice.
   Conclusions: Results do not allow a general statement whether attitudes towards suicide are permissive or restrictive. However, in the subgroup of respondents with SI we found a tendency towards permissiveness regarding suicide.

AB Background: Changes in the suicide rate within one region over time had been hypothesised to correspond to changes in suicide seasonality: a recent investigation from Italy confirmed such an assumption. Data from Slovenia were investigated to further evaluate the links between suicide rates and seasonal amplitude.
   Methods: A total of 14 325 male suicides and 4350 female suicides occurring in Slovenia from 1971 to 2002 were investigated with harmonic spectral analysis to extract their monthly seasonal dispersion by eight-year intervals. Changes in rate over time were analysed with a test for trend based on regression analysis.
   Results: The suicide rates of both males and females increased over time, with an evident peak in the 1987-1994 period and a decrease thereafter. Seasonality decreased across time in both sexes; however, no change of the peak was observed over time. The amplitude of the major 12-month cycle was slightly positively related to suicide rates, but the correlation was only statistically significant among females (P=0.0053; males: P=0.22).
   Limitations: Data could not be analysed according to age, the method of suicide, or the diagnosis attributable to the deceased, since this information was not available.
   Conclusion: The study confirmed that the seasonal effect on mortality by suicide is positively related to suicide rates, so much so that changes in suicide rates over time correspond to changes in suicide seasonality, but in Slovenia this effect was only evident among females, further pointing towards differences by sex in the mechanics leading to suicide.

AB The goals of the Postvention Taskforce of the International Association for Suicide Prevention (IASP) are to increase awareness of postvention and survivor issues. One of the strategies is to organize meetings. We report on the 1st International Suicide Postvention Seminar, held as a 1-day preevent at the 11th European Symposium on Suicide and Suicidal Behavior in Portoroz, Slovenia, September 2006. The seminar provided a state of the art review of the postvention field, with plenary presentations on research, psychotherapeutic care, development of national networks, and of postvention materials. We summarize the presentations below.

AB Background: The political and socio-economic situation in Slovenia, a former Yugoslav republic, a country in transition and a country with a high suicide rate,,which joined the European Union in 2004, has changed steadily since the beginning of the 1970s. Literature shows constancy in suicide statistics in Slovenia during these times.
   Aim: The present study examines whether the suicidal adolescent inpatient population in Slovenia reflects recent social changes and upheavals.
   Method: Data on two groups, of patients admitted to a specialized adolescent psychiatry: department after attempting suicide were collected. The first group (n = 74) were patients admitted from 1975 to 1977, the second group (n = 73) from 2002 to 2004. They were compared on general characteristics, family and living circumstances, risk behaviors, suicide attempts and diagnoses.
   Results: The comparison revealed statistically significant differences between groups on educational level, number of siblings, frequency of smoking and psychoactive medication misuse as well as number of previous suicide attempts. No differences were found in other family and living circumstances, methods used in the index suicide attempt, other risk behaviors or diagnoses.
   Conclusions: The post-independence suicidal inpatient population in Slovenia shows a tendency towards higher morbidity, but has changed less than expected considering the Vast changes in the society. These results suggest, a certain constancy in adolescent suicidal behavior.

AB Background. Suicide is a serious public health problem in Slovenia. Illicit drug users are in greater danger than the general population. There are several differences in ways of committing suicide that set the illicit drug population apart from the general population. This study has aimed to compare the external causes of death by suicide (specifying the methods used), and to compare narcotic with non-narcotic overdoses among illicit drug users according to gender in the 2004-2007 period in Slovenia. Methods. Information on the subjects was made available by linking the records kept in three national data sources. Results. More than half of these suicide victims had died because of an overdose; more precisely, overdose by prescription drugs was predominant. In more than half of the cases of suicide committed by males, death was due to an indirect, external cause, whereas in more than half of the cases of suicide committed by females, death was due to an overdose. No other gender differences were found. Females tend to be unregistered by agonist opioid treatment centres. Conclusions. The most common method of suicide was overdose for both genders, with females at greater risk than males. Caution in prescription practice is needed, especially when treating female patients.

AB Background: Addiction is a major social and health problem. Studies on suicide and alcohol at the individual and aggregated level have confirmed a link between alcohol and suicide. Aim: To assess the impact of the new national alcohol policy in Slovenia on the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) in BAC-positive suicide victims before, during and after the implementation of the new national alcohol policy in 2003. Method: Blood samples were collected by forensic pathologists during medicolegal autopsies of suicide victims in order to establish their BAC levels at the time of death. BAC was measured using two routine independent headspace gas chromatography methods (HSS-GC-FID) and expressed in grams per kilogram. Results: During the period before the implementation of the act which limited the availability of alcohol in Slovenia, the BACs of BAC-positive suicide victims were higher than those tested in the period after the implementation of the act. Conclusion: Despite certain limitations, this study demonstrates that legislation measures restricting alcohol availability may be an effective measure of BAC reduction in BAC-positive suicide victims.

AB The rate of suicide remains high in Slovenia, particularly in rural settings and among farmers. As is the case with many issues faced by rural people, few social responses are developed in terms of political action, health and social services and research. In this article, the severity of farmers' suicide in Slovenia is detailed and analysed as a social problem based on the following criteria: first, the scope of the situation is considered worrying and unequal; second, normative structures are abnormally or harmfully connected to the situation; third, there is a will and a power to transform the situation because it is found unacceptable according to social ethics and values; and fourth, the implementation of social responses such as intervention programmes and collective actions. This framework enables to highlight the importance of gender (masculinities), location (rural settings), local culture (agrarian values) and occupation (farming). Priority for future policies, practice and research should focus on these social determinants of health and wellbeing in support of farming people, communities and associations.

In Slovenia, besides the peer review publications and reports, we also included all media reports on stigma in the last five years to illustrate the impact of various professional and public initiatives to reduce stigma and discrimination against depression. The Slovenian report includes several areas of mental health stigma defined through peer reviewed literature and other professional publications.

AB Background: Heroin Use Disorder (HUD) patients are more endangered by suicide than the general population. Excess suicide mortality and the risk factor for suicide in HUD patients seeking Opioid Agonist Treatment (OAT) in Slovenia were both assessed. Methods: Record-linkage study of a well-defined cohort of 3,949 HUD patients seeking OAT in Slovenia in the period from 1st January 2004 to 31st December 2006, and General Mortality Register for ascertained vital status in cohort till 31st December 2011. Results: In the 2004-2011 period there were 31 suicides among 3,949 HUD patients seeking OAT. Standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for suicide in HUD patients was 4 (95% CI: 2.8-5.6) times higher than that of the general Slovenian population of the same age over the same period of time. SMR for male HUD patients was 3.7 (95% CI 2.6-5.4) times higher than that of Slovenian males of same age and 2.2 times higher than that of females. SMR for female HUD patients was 7 (95% CI: 2.6-18.7) times higher than that of Slovenian females of the same age. Higher age at cohort treatment entry is an important risk factor for suicide; hazard risk for suicide was significantly higher in patients entering the cohort when older (HR=1.08, 95% CI: 1.02-1.13, p=0.003), whereas those at their first OAT episode seem to be protected from suicide (HR=0.139, 95% CI: 0.019-1.036, p=0.054), while male gender, unemployment and a living alone status do not constitute a statistically significant risk factor for suicide in HUD patients seeking OAT. Conclusions: Specific suicide prevention interventions tailored to the needs of HUD patients are required.

AB Background: Slovenia is amongst countries with the highest suicide rate, which is increasing in old age. Suicide risk factors in old age are similar to those in other life periods, but with different impact. Mental disorders, personality traits, physical illnesses and life circumstances are factors associated with suicide. By far the most important suicide risk in old age is depression.
   Conclusions: Recognizing depression, especially in general practice, is important for successfully treating and consequently reducing suicide risk in old age.

DE accidents; traffic; cause of death; epidemiology; Slovenia; suicide
AB Aim. To investigate the characteristics of undetermined deaths by examining similarities and differences between undetermined deaths and other death categories, such as suicides, fatal traffic accidents, and remaining deaths.
   Methods. The group of undetermined deaths was compared to other death categories with respect to sex, age, marital status, and month of death of the deceased. A total yearly number of 18.508 deaths in Slovenia in 2001 was analyzed.
   Results. Significantly more men died in fatal traffic accidents and committed suicide than from undetermined causes. Persons dying in fatal traffic accidents and committing suicides were significantly younger than those dying from undetermined causes of death, whereas persons dying from remaining causes of death were older. The marital status profiles of persons dying from undetermined causes and those committing suicides were similar. Also, undetermined deaths and suicides were both more likely to occur in April and May.
   Conclusion. Underestimation of actual number of suicides could be assumed, given the similarities with the group of undetermined deaths in both seasonality and marital status. As some differences were obtained between the two groups in sex and age, we may conclude that some cases of older women suicides are concealed within the undetermined deaths group.

ID GASTRIC LAVAGE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; SUICIDE
AB Background The Slovenian Register of Intoxications managed by the Poison Control Centre at Ljubljana University Medical Centre was established in 2001. It offers a continuous review of poisoning in Slovenia. Our aim was to study the epidemiology of acute drug poisoning in adult patients admitted to hospitals in Slovenia.
   Methods We analyzed the data of reported acutely poisoned patients older than 16 years who were treated in hospitals in Slovenia between 2001 and 2005.
   Results A total of 1,838 adult acutely poisoned patients were reported to the Register of Intoxications between 2001 and 2005, of whom 1,234 (67 %) were poisoned by drugs. 67 % of patients poisoned by drugs were women and 76 % of patients ingested drugs at home. 85 % of patients ingested drugs in suicide attempts. Anxyolytics, hypnotics, sedatives, antipsychotics and antidepressants represented 68 % of all ingested drugs due to self-poisoning. Drugs for the musculo-skeletal system and drugs for the cardiovascular system followed poisoning by these drugs. There were 6 benzodiazepines and related drugs between the 10 most commonly ingested drugs due to self-poisoning. The most common signs of acute drug poisoning were somnolence and coma ( 75 %). A gastric lavage was performed in 64 % of patients, active charcoal was given to 73 % of patients and 35 % of patients were treated with an antidote.
   Conclusions Poisoning by drugs for the nervous system, particularly benzodiazepines, is the most common form of poisoning by drugs in Slovenia. It would be necessary to report all acutely poisoned patients to the Register of Intoxications, since we need data about all poisoning in Slovenia to improve their prophylaxis and treatment.

AB Background: Recent studies have reported changes in the time patterns of suicide, with reduced seasonality in some European and Asian countries. Anyway conflicting data were reported on the fading of suicide seasonality, and in some countries a rising trend was reported.
   Methods: Harmonic spectral analysis was used to analyze all suicides in Slovenia in the years 1971 to 2002 (14,325 among males; 4350 among females). Analyses of overall changes are based on data aggregated by intervals of 8 years.
   Results: In both sexes, seasonal variance accounts for a statistically significant proportion of total variance (36.0% among males; 13.3% among females). Anyway in both sexes the season-attributable variance in the latest interval is considerably lower than in the preceding periods.
   Limitations: Data could not be analyzed according to age or to mental disorder diagnosis, since this information was not available.
   Conclusion: The seasonal effect on mortality by suicide is sensitive to change, but its causes seem not to be sex-dependant. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Previous studies have reported that many suicide victims have had contact with their physicians a week or month prior to their suicide.
   Aims: To assess the date of the last appointment (and complaint) of suicide victims in the Skofja Loka region within Slovenia.
   Method: We included all suicide victims in the region in the period 1993-2003. Each of the cases was assigned the closest control in terms of age and gender. Medical death certificates served as a source of demographic data information and information about suicide method. From personal medical records we obtained the date of the last appointment (and the complaint) with the primary care physician. The same was done for the control group. The groups were compared for their last appointment with their physician (date and complaint).
   Results: Thirty out of 77 suicide victims visited their physician in the last month before suicide (14/77 in the last week); only 16/77 controls did so before the index day (3/77 in the last week). In 30% of suicide victims, the reason for the last visit was mental health problems (only 3% in the control group).
   Conclusion: The results emphasize the important role of primary care physicians in suicide prevention.

AB Background and aims: Both data and studies have documented high rates of suicide in Slovenia. More specifically, suicide accounts for a considerable share of premature deaths in illicit drug users, where heroin addicts predominate. The analysis of national data on suicide among illicit drug users in Slovenia revealed several differences in suicide behaviours between the general population and the illicit drug user population. The aim of this study has been to find out the opinions of a group of psychiatrists about the calculated results and the indicators used in analysis. Methods: The national data on suicide among illicit drug users were analysed and presented to a focus group. Focus group methodology was used. Results: The psychiatrists in the group showed little awareness of Slovenian data on suicide and of the differences between data that refer to the general population and those referring to the illicit drug use population. Conclusions: Those psychiatrists expressed interest in being updated on the periodic analysis of these data and indicators, so that they would be able to use them in everyday clinical practice. Specific suicide prevention programmes tailored to the needs of illicit drug users, especially heroin addicts, should be developed after reviewing the results of both quantitative and qualitative research.

AB During the investigated period, 2000-2007, 4249 suicides were reported in Slovenia, and 1061 autopsies of suicide deaths from the central, northwestern, and southwestern parts of Slovenia were conducted at the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Ljubljana. To identify a possible role of alcohol use in the selection of suicide method blood samples were collected during medicolegal autopsies of suicide victims in order to establish their blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level at the time of death. The study group consisted of 844 suicide victims that used violent suicide methods and 174 suicide victims that used non-violent suicide methods. Out of the group with violent suicide methods 184 (21.8%) suicide victims by partial hanging and 112 (13.3%) suicide victims by complete hanging were identified. The average age was higher in the group of suicide victims by partial hanging than in the group of suicide victims by complete hanging (p < 0.001; T = 3653; df = 294). The mean BAC was higher (T = 1.604; df = 278; p < 0.05) in the group of suicide victims by partial hanging (0.57 g/kg; SD +/- 0.92) than in the group of suicide victims by complete hanging (0.40 g/kg; SD +/- 0.82). The proportion of BAC positive suicide victims with blood alcohol concentration above 0.1 g/kg at the time of death was higher in the group of suicide victims who used non-violent suicide methods in comparison to the group of suicide victims who used violent suicide methods (p < 0.001; chi(2) = 14.988, df = 1). Partial hanging was almost twice as common as complete hanging. Higher BAC in the group of suicide victims by partial hanging and more BAC positive suicide victims in the group who died by nonviolent suicide methods could give indications about the role of alcohol in the selection of suicide method.

AB Background: Only few studies have so far confirmed the clear connection of attitudes toward suicide with prevalence of suicidal behavior, and there are several contradictory findings on the balance of this relationship. Slovenia has long had a very high suicide rate, including in the population of adolescents. Aims: To examine attitudes of Slovene adolescents toward suicide and their connection to different suicide risk factors. Methods: A questionnaire on attitudes toward suicide was given to 423 high school students from three regions based on the different regional suicide rates. Results: The results proved our expectation of girls having more permissive attitudes toward suicide than boys. Also, a permissive attitude was positively associated with the majority of suicide risk factors. Conclusions: In the light of certain limitations of the study we discuss the implications of the main finding, namely, that permissive attitudes toward suicide are more likely a risk than a safety factor for suicidal behavior.

AB Aim To investigate the influence of socioeconomic factors, mental health service availability, and prevalence of mental disorders on regional differences in the suicide rate in Slovenia.
   Methods The effects of different socioeconomic factors, mental health service availability, and mental disorders factors on suicide rates from 2000-2009 were analyzed using a general linear mixed model (GLMM). Pearson correlations were used to explore the direction and magnitude of associations.
   Results Among socioeconomic factors, unemployment rate ranked as the most powerful predictor of suicide and an increase of one unit in the unemployment rate increased regional suicide rate by 2.21 (beta = 2.21, 95% confidence intervals [CI] = 1.87-2.54, P < 0.001). On the other hand, higher marriage/ divorce ratio was negatively related to the suicide rate and an increase of one unit in marriage/ divorce ratio reduced regional suicide rate by 1.16 (beta = -1.16, 95% CI = -2.20 to -0.13, P < 0.031). The most influential mental health service availability parameter was higher psychiatrist availability (4 psychiatrists and more working at outpatient clinics per 100 000 inhabitants), which was negatively correlated with the suicide rate and reduced regional suicide rate by 2.95 (beta = -2.95, 95% CI = -4.60 to -1.31, P = 0.002). Another negatively correlated factor was the antidepressant/anxiolytic ratio higher than 0.5, which reduced the regional suicide rate by 2.32 (beta = -2.32, 95% CI = -3.75 to -0.89, P = 0.003). Among mental health disorders, only the prevalence of alcohol use disorders was significantly related to the regional suicide rates and an increase of one unit in the prevalence of alcohol use disorders per 1000 inhabitants increased the regional suicide rate by 0.02 (beta = 0.02, 95% CI = 0.01-0.03, P = 0.008).
   Conclusions Besides unemployment, which was a very strong predictor of suicide rates, unequal availability of mental health services and quality of depressive disorder treatment may contribute to variations in suicide rates in different regions.

TI THE ADAPTATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF GUIDELINES FOR RESPONSIBLE MEDIA
   REPORTING ON SUICIDE IN SLOVENIA
SO ZDRAVSTVENO VARSTVO
LA English
DT Article

ID PREVENTION STRATEGIES; DEPRESSION; ALLIANCE
AB Introduction. The existing literature provides evidence of the link between media reporting and suicide in terms of either preventive or provocative effects. Hence, working with media representatives on responsible reporting on suicide is of great importance. Until recently in Slovenia, there has been an obvious lack of communication between media representatives and suicidologists. The aims of the present study were twofold; firstly, to introduce the adaptation and dissemination of intervention on responsible media reporting, and secondly, to evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented intervention on suicide reporting.
   Methods. We used a pre-post research design. Newspaper articles were retrieved over two 12-month periods: the baseline period and the follow-up period. In between, we had a year of implementation of our intervention program (launching and disseminating the Guidelines via workshops). Each retrieved article was rated qualitatively with respect to its adherence to the Guidelines.
   Results. The comparison of baseline and follow-up periods revealed some significant differences. Reporting in the follow-up period was less sensationalistic, there was less reporting about specific cases of suicides and more about causes of suicide and pathways out of mental distress. Furthermore, in the follow-up period, there was a significant improvement related to headlines of media articles. Contact information about where to seek help was more often included in the articles.
   Conclusion. The findings are promising, but working with the media needs to be continuous and ongoing if sustainable results are to be achieved.

AB We compared main characteristics of 58 (22 male and 36 female) psychiatric inpatients that committed suicide in the psychiatric hospital with all 1261 suicides (956 male and 305 female) that occurred outside hospitals in the same health district of Slovenia, all these in the period between 1985 and 1993. The independent t-test and cross-tabulation were used to compare the two groups on age, sex, marital status and suicide method profile. It appeared that female suicide is much more frequent in the psychiatric inpatients' group than in others. Only male psychiatric inpatients' suicides are younger than other suicide victims. Psychiatric inpatients use methods like jumping from high places and drowning more often than do others, which goes in line with the availability of methods of suicide. Apparently, the studied hospital has some wards on the third floor and majority of acute wards are located by the river. However, psychiatric inpatients do not differ from other suicide victims on marital status. Higher suicide rates in men compared with women in the population, but not in psychiatric inpatients, could be explained by the presence of so-called atypical, clinically unrecognized depression in the male population.

AB Slovenia, with its population of 2 million, has one of the highest suicide rates in Europe (around 30 per 100, 000). It has been determined by twin studies that up to 45% of the variance in suicidal ideation and behaviour may be attributable to genetic variables. In the present paper we report on a case of a male suicide victim. Before the psychological autopsy was performed we genotyped this person for 15 genetic polymorphisms of the serotonergic pathway, since molecular-genetic studies of neurotransmitters from brain and blood samples of suicide victims have shown that the serotonergic system might be implicated in suicide. This case report evaluated by psychological autopsy and serotoninergic gene polymorphisms determination indicates the influence of genetic and environmental factors contributing to the suicidal behaviour of the individual person. Probably the interplay between genes and stressful events jut before suicide, together with mental disorder lead to suicide in the case described.

ID RISK-FACTORS
AB Monitoring of the association between suicide and drug-related deaths (DRDs) in illicit drug users is not carried out consistently in many European countries. In our study, we evaluated DRD suicides unrelated to alcohol in Slovenia during the years 2002-2007, and compared suicide methods between males and females. Out of 356 cases of DRD, 106 (64 males and 42 females) were DRD suicides. Of these, 69 (65.1%) were due to intentional self-poisoning by drugs, 30 (28.3%) were due to other methods for committing suicide, and 7 (6.6%) utilized intentional poisoning together with another method. Females were older than males; self-poisoning with benzodiazepines was more frequent in females and, in our study, no females were self-harmed by hanging, by suffocation, or by firearms. In females, age was tested as a risk factor that has proved to be more important than suicide modality, but the use of benzodiazepines in female illicit drug users should be considered a critical issue with increasing age.

   Epidemiologic Analysis

LA English
DT Article

AB Background: Seasonality of suicides is well-known and nearly ubiquitous, but recent evidence showed inconsistent patterns of decreasing or increasing seasonality in different countries. Furthermore, strength of seasonality was hypothesized to be associated with suicide prevalence. This study aimed at pointing out methodological difficulties in examining changes in suicide seasonality.
   Methododology/Principal Findings: The present study examines the hypothesis of decreasing seasonality with a superior method that allows continuous modeling of seasonality. Suicides in Austria (1970-2008, N = 67,741) were analyzed with complex demodulation, a local (point-in-time specific) version of harmonic analysis. This avoids the need to arbitrarily split the time series, as is common practice in the field of suicide seasonality research, and facilitates incorporating the association with suicide prevalence. Regression models were used to assess time trends and association of amplitude and absolute suicide numbers. Results showed that strength of seasonality was associated with absolute suicide numbers, and that strength of seasonality was stable during the study period when this association was taken into account.
   Conclusion/Significance: Continuous modeling of suicide seasonality with complex demodulation avoids spurious findings that can result when time series are segmented and analyzed piecewise or when the association with suicide prevalence is disregarded.

AB In Europe, the countries with the highest suicide rates form a so-called J-curve, which starts in Finland and extends down to Slovenia-a country with one of the world's highest suicide rates. So far, the strongest association between suicide and genes has been shown for the serotonergic system. A functional polymorphism 68G > C (Cys23Ser) and a promoter polymorphism-995G > A of serotonin receptor 2C (HTR2C) have already been investigated, but no associations with suicide were determined. In the present study 334 suicide victims and 211 controls of Slovenian origin were genotyped for the above-mentioned polymorphisms using standard methods. In the case of the polymorphism-995G > A no association with suicide was found. However, a significant association was observed between female suicide victims and polymorphism 68G > C. The significance remained when we combined alleles of female and male populations. An excess of GG genotype and allele G was observed. However, no statistically important differences were present when only males were analyzed. Haplotype analysis on female population showed marginal association of haplotype G-C with suicide. The present study speaks for the plausible implication of the HTR2C in suicide susceptibility.

AB Background: Different types of marital status are associated with different levels of suicidal risk. Aims: To study marital status change and the effect of its recency in relation to suicidal behavior. Methods: Suicide victims (1614) in Slovenia and matched controls (4617) were compared for incidence and recency of marital status change during the last 5 years of their lives. Results: A higher percentage of suicide victims (10.7%) had a marital status change in the last 5 years compared with the controls (5.6%). All types of marital status changes (becoming widowed, getting divorced, getting married) proved to be risk factors for suicidal behavior. Almost half of all marital status changes in suicide victims occurred in the year prior to suicide, whereas marital status changes in the control group were equally distributed over the last 5 years. For recently married and divorced people, the increase in suicide risk depended on age: The risk was higher in older people. Conclusions: Marital status change represents a risk factor for suicidal behavior. The first year after the change is critical for elevated suicidal risk, in particular for older people.

AB The pattern of geographic variation in European suicide rates in the high-risk group of individuals aged 65 years and over was investigated, in order to provide a further test of the Finno-Ugrian Suicide Hypothesis, i.e. the assumption that genetic differences between populations may partially account for spatial differences seen in the suicide prevalence. National suicide rates (average of 1970-2002) of the elderly from 34 European countries were regressed on geographic position terms, i.e. capital cities' latitude and longitude, along with transformations (e.g. squared latitude) and interaction terms (e.g. latitude multiplied with longitude) of these, which statistically modeled various possible geographic gradients in the suicide rates. In these regression models, the strongest and statistically significant predictor of elderly suicide rates was an interaction term of squared latitude multiplied with longitude, indicating that suicide rates increased to the northeast. This accounted for 13.8% (total), 20.8% (males) and 11.6% (females) of the cross-national variance in elderly suicide rates. No further geographic position term accounted for a significant increment of further variance in suicide rates over and above this predictor. Controls for national quality of living conditions and alcohol consumption rates left these results essentially unchanged. Replicating previous evidence based on suicide rates of the general population, suicide rates of the elderly show a northeastern gradient across Europe. This J-shaped belt of high-suicide-rate countries spans from Central Europe (Austria, Hungary and Slovenia) to Northeastern Europe (Finland and the Baltic countries). There are early historical and genetic communalities among the populations inhabiting this area, but, in terms of culture, recent history, political systems and socioeconomic factors, there is great diversity between these countries. The current findings thus add to cumulated empirical evidence consistent with the Finno-Ugrian Suicide Hypothesis.

AB Background and aims. As a premature, unnatural and preventable form of death, fatal poisoning is a serious public health problem. Illicit drug users show a high risk factor for fatal poisoning. In this study regarding deceased Slovenian illicit drug users during the years 2002-2007, we differentiated between intentional and unintentional fatal poisoning, using demographic and toxicological data. Methods. We evaluated the fatal poisoning occurring in those years in Slovenia. Results. 127 (47.4%) subjects committed fatal poisonings with undetermined intent, 71 (26.5%) with accidental intent and 70 (26.1%) with full intent. Age at suicide was lowest for accidental intoxications and highest for intentional intoxication. Half of the victims for intentional intoxication were females. Widows/widowers were better represented in the intentional poisoning group. Alcohol intoxication was found less frequently in that same group; opioids were found less frequently in the intentional group; cocaine was found more frequently in accidental intoxications and only minimally in intentional intoxication. Regarding predictors of intentional intoxication, gender (males), age (older) and alcohol were the most discriminant characteristics. Conclusions. Gender (male), age (older) and non-use of alcohol during intoxication were the best predictors of the intention to commit suicide by poisoning (in Slovenian users of illicit drugs).

ID PSYCHIATRISTS; EXPERIENCES; IMPACT
AB Background: Most patients that commit suicide consult their GPs before their death. This topic is often surrounded by secrecy and associated with guilt and shame. There is a lack of knowledge about support for GPs after patient suicide.
   Objectives: To identify the widest range of Slovenian GPs' problems and needs in connection with patient suicide, and, based on the findings of the study, to prepare ways to assist GPs after patient suicide.
   Methods: Semi-structured interviews were held with GPs that had experienced a patient's suicide during their professional career until saturation was reached. The interview guide was piloted. Twenty-two in-depth interviews were carried out between April 2012 and February 2013. Transcripts were coded and thematically analysed using qualitative content analysis.
   Results: Participating GPs suggested possible forms of support, most frequently individual consultation with a psychologist or a psychiatrist, in person, by phone, or via e-mail. Balint groups, group consultations and various workshops on suicide or depression would be a preferable form of support. Some GPs perceived critical incident review as an attempt to blame them, whereas others saw it as an opportunity for support. A group of peers that could discuss professional dilemmas in which more experienced GPs would help younger GPs would be helpful.
   Conclusion: Slovenian GPs did not have any formal support system at the time of the research, but they would appreciate such a possibility.

TI SUICIDE AND SUICIDE ATTEMPT DESCRIPTORS BY MULTIMETHOD APPROACH
SO PSYCHIATRIA DANUBINA
LA English
DT Article
DE suicide commitment; suicide attempt; multimethod
ID RISK-FACTORS; COUNTRIES
AB Background: Suicide is a complex action of suicidal methods and peripheral factors with seemingly threatening components representing actual cause for the suicidal actions. It is especially those, apparently unimportant factors that represent a crucial milestone in the network of all the other, personal, cultural, genetic and biochemical factors, forming the method of action consequently deciding between life and death.
   Subjects and methods: Based on the Register of Suicides in the Republic of Slovenia kept by the University Psychiatric Clinic Ljubljana, we used a combination of attributes varying within a variable and between variables. Due to limited application of standard statistical methods and analyses in such cases, we used the Machine learning method, Multimethod hybrid approach, which allows combining of different approaches to machine learning (decision trees, genetic algorithms and supplementary vectors). The research included 56712 persons attempting suicide and 21913 persons committing suicide. We chose a form of a suicide action with both possible results: attempted suicide and suicide.
   Results: Based on the analysis of machine learning, we defined attributes of the action regarding their lethal effect: attempted suicide and suicide commitment. The suicide register kept for the last 40 years shows hanging as the most commonly used suicidal method, used by men with the purpose of causing suicidal death rather than a suicidal attempt. On the other hand, use of medicaments is linked to the suicidal attempt and mostly used by females.
   Conclusions: All methods of suicidal actions cannot predict suicidal death, thus we examined different methods of suicide to most accurately predict the link between the method and its effect in terms of suicide attempt or suicide. The Machine learning method confirmed the attributes of suicide methods in connection with their different outcomes. This analytical method is useful in processing large databases since it enables one variable's intensity to affect other variables in terms of result and meaning. The identification of the most decisive risk factors for suicidal behaviour can serve as basis for planning an effective prevention strategies, timely identification and adequate proffessional help to the high risk persons.

AB Background: Research shows the elevated risk of suicide associated with current or recent inpatient psychiatric hospitalization. However, it is unclear whether this applies in the area of post-communist Central and Eastern Europe where mental health care has not been deinstitutionalized yet. The present study aims to examine the rates of suicides among psychiatric patients during and shortly after discharge from inpatient hospitalization in the Czech Republic.
   Methods: All inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations and all suicides committed between 2008 and 2012 have been merged on an individual data basis. The time horizon between the admission and two months after the discharge from inpatient psychiatric facility was utilized and multiple logistic regression was performed to calculate the odds of committing suicide.
   Results: A total of 137,290 inpatients were hospitalized in Czech psychiatric facilities between 2008 and 2012, and 402 of the inpatients committed suicide during he hospitalization or within the 2 months after the discharge. Highly elevated risks of suicides were found to be associated with being a male, having a history of multiple hospitalizations, and having a diagnosis of affective, anxiety, or personality disorder.
   Limitations: Limitations are related to the design of the study, and its reliance on routinely collected data. Also, it was not possible to assess the odds of suicide associated with inpatient psychiatric hospitalization against the odds of suicide in general population.
   Conclusions: During psychiatric treatment and recovery, suicial behavior and idealiation is increased. In psychiatry, hospitalization may be a risky period for suicide behavior. Suicide rates during and soon after the psychiatric hospitalization identified in this study from Central and Eastern Europe are similar to the findings from Western Europe. Preventive strategies should be tailored accordingly. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB ObjectiveThe most abundant neurotrophin in the mammalian brain is brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which acts through binding to neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 2 (NTRK2) and to nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR). Our previous work showed an association of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6265 in the BDNF gene with completed suicide in the Slavic population. Therefore, we extended the investigation to the SNPs within NTRK2 and NGFR genes and searched for associations with the completed suicide phenotype.Materials and methodsIn 775 Caucasian individuals, namely, 486 suicide completers and 289 controls, we performed genotyping of five SNPs within the NTRK2 (rs11140714, rs1147198, rs1187323, rs10780691, and rs10868235) and six SNPs within the NGFR (rs2072446, rs7219709, rs7224806, rs734194, rs741071, and rs741072) genes.ResultsWe did not find evidence for an association of the SNPs studied with the phenotype either on the single marker or on the haplotype level.ConclusionTo our knowledge, this is the first study that has examined SNPs in the NTRK2 and NGFR genes for associations with the completed suicide phenotype. However, our findings suggest that these SNPs may not be associated particularly with completed suicide in Slovenia, although they might have a relevant informative value as the study has been carried out on a sample from a population that has one of the highest suicide rates in the world.

AB Aim: The aim of the present study was to examine whether there is any association between receiving medication-assisted treatment for opioid dependence (MAT) with the duration of substance abuse. Methods: Data were collected using self-rating questionnaires in Slovenia from 1997 to 2007. Results: Of the 2,853 patients included, 2,494 provided valid data (87%; cases where data were missing: 359; 13%). Of those 2,494, 2,075 (83%) patients were assigned to the group with no previous history of overdose, 356 (14%) to the group with at least one previous overdose, without involving any suicide attempt, and 63 (3%) to the group of patients with previous suicide attempt(s) by overdose. Using multivariate logistic regression, the two risk factors associated with suicide attempts by overdose were: age (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.01-1.09) and age at first PAS use (OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.77-0.96), while the three risk factors associated with overdose without suicide attempts were: age (OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01-1.06), age at initial PAS use (OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.91-0.99) and unemployment (OR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.23-2.55). Conclusion: These findings suggest that it is not the years of PAS usage, but the patient's age at first use that was an important risk factor associated both with suicide attempts by overdose and the finding of overdose without any suicide attempts. We suggest that special attention should be directed to suicidal behaviour with a primary focus on patients with heroin addiction, in particular to cases of non-fatal overdose and those of suicide attempts by overdose among individuals with heroin addiction who initiated drug misuse at an early age.

   Method. Potential economic losses to society were estimated by use of years of potential life lost (YPLL), with a cut-off point at 65 years, and valued years of potential life lost (VYPLL) methods. We calculated the sex-, age-, and underlying causes of death-specific YPLL and VYPLL for residents of Slovenia who died at age younger than 65 years, using Slovene sex-specific life expectancy for 1998/1999 and age-specific weights of investment-producer-consumer model.
   Results. In 1998, 4,558 YPLL per 100,000 population were lost to Slovenia. We found bimodal age distribution of YPLL, with the first peak in the 20-24 year age group and the second in the 45-49 year age group. Men to women rate ratio was 2.5. The leading causes of YPLL were external causes of death, followed by malignant neoplasms, and cardiovascular diseases. External causes, including suicides and traffic accidents, were the leading causes of death in men, whereas malignant neoplasms, including breast cancer and digestive cancer, were top-ranking causes in women. Among those, only external causes of death produced positive VYPLL, indicating a net loss to the society.
   Conclusion. In Slovenia, YPLL peaked in the 20-24 and 45-49 year age groups. Only external causes of death, most of which were preventable, accounted for the net economic loss to Slovenian society. We believe that YPLL and VYPLL, as specific mortality measures, can be reliably used in the evaluation of leading causes of death before age 65 and potential economic loss to the society caused by those deaths, and that they should be taken into account when setting public health priorities.

AB The current state of knowledge of genetic predisposition towards the suicidal behavior allows for a question whether genetic risk factors account for the variation in suicide rates through time and space. Accordingly, the presented study will attempt to tackle the genetics behind suicidal behavior from the perspective of the populational genetics, First, the variability of suicide rates across Europe is discussed. This is followed by a brief discussion of the J curve (on a map of Europe, the countries with a higher suicide rate form a so-called J curve, which starts in Finland and extends down to Slovenia), which maps on to the second principal component identified for European gene distribution, representing the ancestral adaptation to cold climates and the Uralic language dispersion. Furthermore, we will discuss whether the group of people living within the J-curve could share genes, which may not tolerate excessive amounts alcohol, the combination of which is more likely to end in suicidal behavior. Further along we list possible ways in which suicidal behavior could have been selected for genetically in populations and identify those specific populations in which it may have appeared. Finally, we point at other locations in the world where a similar interplay of genes and environment has probably occurred, Greenland being the best example of the malignant interaction of alcohol consumption and the trait-like characteristics, which might constitute the vulnerability to suicidal behavior.

AB A number of studies have established a strong connection between acute inebriation, alcohol addiction and suicides, as the last act of alcoholism or an act of desperation in an alcoholic's family, an act of escape from restraints in state of depression or as a way of self-destruction.
   In recent years in average 600 people per year committed suicide. Slovenia is a country with extremely high and variable suicide tendencies and harmful alcohol use levels, as well as a high level of alcohol-related troubles.
   The aim of our research was to ascertain some typical features, especially those connected to the inebriation of suicide victims from a wider Ljubljana region. Autopsies were carried out on the victims in the period between 1995 and 1999.
   There were 508 (31.2%) suicides among all the analyzed violent deaths; 73.2% of them were men. The average age of the victims was 46.5 years. Most suicides were committed at home (50.0%). 25.4% were completely sober in the moment of the act, while in all other cases inebriation was established, the average value being 9.57 g/kg. Men were drunk in 87.1% of cases, women only in 12.9% and the given alcohol levels were substantially higher with men (0.65:0.26 g/kg). The share of inebriated persons decreases with age-reaching its peak in the 35-54 age group. Regarding the method, the predominant ones are intoxication and the use of firearms, which is a typical way of committing suicide among men, while women rather choose jumping from great heights and drowning.
   Alcohol was present in as many as 55.7% of suicides with intoxication and in 68.8% of all suicides committed by using firearms, while the highest alcohol levels were found in those who died from cutting their veins (2.01 g/kg),
   Based on this and on other research, more effort should be focused on alcohol abuse prevention, making all people aware of the consequences of alcohol abuse, the possibilities of treatment and their availability as well as possible co-morbid depressions. Simultaneously, due to an established link, the national alcohol policy and strategy for prevention of suicides should be professionally harmonized. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB A number of health outcomes were affected by previous financial crises, e. g. suicides, homicides and transport accident mortality. Aim of this study was to analyse the effects of the current financial crisis on selected health outcomes at population level in Europe. Methods: A mixed approach of ecologic and time trend design was applied, including correlation analysis. For eight countries, data on the economic situation (unemployment rate and economic growth) and health indicators (overall mortality, suicide and transport accident mortality) was drawn from EUROSTAT database for 2000-10. Spearman's rank correlation was applied to analyse the influence of social protection on the association between exposure and outcome variables. Results: The financial crisis had no visible effect on overall mortality in any of the eight countries until 2010. Transport accident mortality decreased in all eight countries, in the range of 18% in Portugal to 52% in Slovenia. In contrast, suicide mortality increased in Germany (+5.3%), Portugal (+5.2%), Czech Republic (+7.6%), Slovakia (+22.7%) and Poland (+19.3%). The effect of unemployment on suicide is higher in countries with lower social spending (Spearman's r = -0.83). Discussion: Clear cause-effect relations could not be established owing to the ecological study design and issues concerning data availability. However, there are clear changes in suicide and transport accident mortality after onset of the crisis, and findings are consistent with previous work. As part of this work, a comprehensive framework was developed, which can be applied to analyse health effects of financial crises in more detail.

   ADOLESCENT SUICIDE; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; CHILD; PROGRAM; PARTICIPATION;
   DEPRESSION
AB Background: There have been only a few reports illustrating the moderate effectiveness of suicide-preventive interventions in reducing suicidal behavior, and, in most of those studies, the target populations were primarily adults, whereas few focused on adolescents. Essentially, there have been no randomized controlled studies comparing the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and cultural adaptability of suicide-prevention strategies in schools. There is also a lack of information on whether suicide-preventive interventions can, in addition to preventing suicide, reduce risk behaviors and promote healthier ones as well as improve young people's mental health.
   The aim of the SEYLE project, which is funded by the European Union under the Seventh Framework Health Program, is to address these issues by collecting baseline and follow-up data on health and well-being among European adolescents and compiling an epidemiological database; testing, in a randomized controlled trial, three different suicide-preventive interventions; evaluating the outcome of each intervention in comparison with a control group from a multidisciplinary perspective; as well as recommending culturally adjusted models for promoting mental health and preventing suicidal behaviors.
   Methods and design: The study comprises 11,000 adolescents emitted from randomized schools in 11 European countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden serving as the scientific coordinating center. Each country performs three active interventions and one minimal intervention as a control group. The active interventions include gatekeeper training (QPR), awareness training on mental health promotion for adolescents, and screening for at-risk adolescents by health professionals. Structured questionnaires are utilized at baseline, 3- and 12-month follow-ups in order to assess changes.
   Discussion: Although it has been reported that suicide-preventive interventions can be effective in decreasing suicidal behavior, well-documented and randomized studies are lacking. The effects of such interventions in terms of combating unhealthy lifestyles in young people, which often characterize suicidal individuals, have never been reported. We know that unhealthy and risk-taking behaviors are detrimental to individuals' current and future health. It is, therefore, crucial to test well-designed, longitudinal mental health-promoting and suicide-preventive interventions by evaluating the implications of such activities for reducing unhealthy and risk behaviors while concurrently promoting healthy ones.

AB Background: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) dates back to the beginning of biologic psychiatry. Particularly, the introduction of general anesthesia and muscle relaxation as well as recent advances in ECT technique greatly reduced the incidence of complications related with ECT and post-interventional adverse cognitive effects. Today, ECT is still the most effective acute antidepressant treatment. In most countries ECT is used for the treatment of severe depression that failed to respond to psychopharmacotherapy and other therapy. Because ECT provides a fast response, it is specially recommended for life-threatening illness conditions including agitation, stupor, food restriction or high suicide risk.
   Conclusions: Within the profession up-todate ECT is considered safe, effective and rapid working treatment for the severest forms of mental disorders. On the contrary, ECT is not performed in Slovenia. No professional reason exists that ECT would not be available in Slovenia. By Slovenian Mental Health Act ECT is considered as a special treatment option for mental disorders, but momentarily different barriers limit the availability of ECT to Slovenian patients, particularly to patients in acute illness conditions.

AB Objective: It has been estimated that domestic violence is wide spread in Slovenia, but the lack of empirical data of domestic violence prevalence and its consequences, aggravate the precise knowledge on the extension of the phenomenon. The aim of the study was to assess the extensiveness and characteristics of domestic violence in the group of Slovenian adolescents.
   Subjects: 1297 young adolescents (age 13-15 years) from 65 Slovenian primary schools participated in the study.
   Methods: A questionnaire for domestic violence experience and help seeking screening, McMaster Family Functioning Scale, Buss/Perry Aggression Questionnaire and Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TM) (TSCC (TM)) have been applied.
   Results: 18,7% of participants experienced violence in their own family (38,3% males and 61,7% females). Different patterns of verbal violence, irritability and indirect violence predominated. In the most cases of domestic violence the adolescent's parents were involved as perpetrators and their close relatives (brothers, sisters). Victims displayed a significant profile that could be linked with their violence experience: dysfunctional family environmental, aggressiveness, anxiety, depression, anger and posttraumatic stress symptoms.
   Conclusions: Presented study confirmed that the phenomenon of domestic violence and abused adolescents is quite widespread in Slovenia and that in the future more attention on research and policy making level should be given to this phenomenon. Particularly the perceived gap between attitudes towards support and the actually given help could be the orientation for developing a better prevention strategies and screening procedures for domestic violence. A proper intervention and protection of the adolescent victims could effectively prevent the outburst of depression, suicide, behavioural problems and, spreading the aggressive behaviour patterns to the future generations.

DE alcohol; suicide; violent death; prevention strategy
AB Consumption of alcohol increases the risk of dying a violent death. We wanted to establish a connection between harmful alcohol use and dying a violent death. We analyzed all such victims in the extended region of Ljubljana. The research included 1630 deceased, who were autopsied at the Forensic Institute of the Ljubljana, Faculty of Medicine in the period from 1995 to 1999. Presence of alcohol was established in 76.3% of the cases. From all included in the research, 38.2% of all work accident victims, 28.8% of all murder victims, 25.4% of suicides, 24.6% of victims involved in traffic accidents and 19.3% of those who died in accidents at home. 23.2% of all violent death victims had a concentration of alcohol above 1.5 g/kg; among those, victims of traffic accidents, suicides and accidents at home represent the largest part. The lowest values of alcohol in blood were found in those who died because of accidents at work. The highest values were found in males aged 35-44. The research confirmed that consumption of alcohol in Slovenia was strongly connected to violent deaths. The blood levels of alcohol of the victims are distinctively higher where there are practically no limitations of alcohol consumption and lower in the environment or activities where legal restrictions prohibit or at least explicitly limit harmful use of alcohol (working environment).

AB Ecstasy is a psychostimulative drug (ab)used mostly by teenagers and young adults in discotheques and on the "rave" parties. Older adults ecstasy abusing cases are very rare. Among four case, of ecstasy abuse with fatal outcome noticed and examined in Slovenia, two were examined at our Institute of Forensic Medicine in Ljubljana. The first case was the accidental intoxication with 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on "rave" party, the second case was suicidal intoxication with combination of insulin and MDMA. Because of the increasing popularity of MDMA, it is important for all emergency physicians to be well educated in prompt recognition of MDMA intoxication symptoms. It is important that emergency physician carefully examines the death scene. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Objective: In a representative sample of 4700 Slovene high school students, we examined their eating behavior and its correlations with some psychosocial and psychological characteristics with the aim of identifying the main risk factors for disordered eating.
   Method: Using a questionnaire which also included Zung's Self-rating Depression Scale and Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale, we compared girls (n = 2507) and boys (n = 2193) with regard to their satisfaction with their body weight, weight-reducing activities, and frequency of binge eating. We assessed their family relationships, abuse of alcohol and other psychoactive drugs, suicidal ideation, and suicidal tendences, as well as their level of depression and self-esteem.
   Results: The results showed significant differences between girls and boys, between groups of those who were satisfied and those who were dissatisfied with their body weight, and also between groups which indulged in frequent binge eating and those which did not.
   Conclusion: Within a general population of adolescents, there is a substantial number of subjects with disordered eating behavior, some part of whom are at high risk for eating disorders. (C) Society for Adolescent Medicine, 2000.

   INDICATOR; DECADES
AB Background: Researchers have found that mortality is decreasing in all socioeconomic population groups but the relative differences in mortality between lower and higher social classes remain unchanged or have even increased. In Slovenia this has not yet been studied.
   Methods: The analysis included all women in Slovenia who died in the 2005-2010 period and were recorded in the Registry of deaths. Cause of death data was linked to data on the educational attainment of the deceased person, which was applied successfully in 98.8% of cases. The rate ratios (RR) for age-standardised death rates were calculated for women with a low and high educational attainment.
   Results: The calculated gap in life expectancy at age 30 between women with low and high educational attainment stood at 5.5 years. Women aged 0-84 with a low educational attainment had a statistically significant higher risk of death than women with a high educational attainment (RR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.57-1.73). Inequalities in premature mortality were even greater (1.78; 1.65-1.93). Educational inequalities in premature mortality were revealed in the majority of causes of death, e.g. cervical cancer (1.99; 1.22-3.67), lung cancer (1.70; 1.30-2.26), cardiovascular diseases (3.02; 2.41-3.91), causes directly attributable to alcohol (7.34; 4.96-12.27), motor vehicle accidents (2.23; 1.21-4.45) and suicide (1.68; 1.19-2.41).
   Conclusions: Significant socioeconomic gaps in women's mortality in Slovenia obligate us to more systematic monitoring of health inequalities in the future. Further research is required in order to clarify specific reasons for the major gaps in mortality from specific causes of death.

AB We report on a case of intoxication with a mix of new psychoactive substances. A 38-year-old male was brought to the emergency department (ED) following the ingestion of an unknown drug in a suicide attempt. During the transport, he became progressively more somnolent and unresponsive to painful stimuli. Urine and stomach content were collected on admission to be screened for drugs of abuse and medicinal drugs. After admission, the patient's next of kin presented five small grip seal plastic bags containing different powders/crystals, and they were sent for analysis along with urine and stomach content to the toxicology laboratory. An easy and rapid sample preparation technique was applied for the extraction of urine and stomach content. Samples were extracted with liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) technique and analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A small amount of powder material from the bags was diluted in methanol and injected directly into the GC-MS instrument. Obtained spectra (EI) were evaluated against SWGDRUG library. Five different designer drugs were identified in the powder material, including synthetic cannabinoids (AB-CHMINACA, AB-FUBINACA) and synthetic cathinones (alpha-PHP, alpha-PVP and 4-CMC). With the exception of 4-CMC, all of these substances were also detected in the stomach content along with the prescription drugs. This is the first time that a positive identification of these five drugs has been made by a clinical laboratory in Slovenia. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Type 1 diabetes is one of the more common chronic conditions in childhood and adolescence. It is an autoimmune disorder that leads to destruction of beta cells in the pancreas and consequently hyperglycemia. Presently, approximately 700 children, adolescents and students up to the age of 25 years from entire Slovenia are followed up for type 1 diabetes. In young people with chronic disease adolescence itself often causes complications in the course of the disease. The risk of complications is even higher in the presence of various psychosocial risk factors. The present article focuses on the prevalence and the influence of risk-taking behavior, mental disorders and suicidal behavior on the course and management of type 1 diabetes in adolescence and summarizes the latest clinical guidelines for the management of adolescents with these comorbidities.

AB The establishment of the exact time and cause of death plays an important role in criminal investigation and criminal law. In violent deaths, where a suspicion that a criminal offence has been committed arises, investigation often focuses on a specific suspect on the basis of a clearly established time and cause of death, or on the examination of other important circumstances surrounding the death in order to close the circle of alleged suspects. An exact post-mortem diagnosis of the time and cause of death requires multidisciplinary cooperation between the police, who establish relevant circumstances surrounding the death, and a physician, who performs a post-mortem examination of the body. This is why the present paper considers post-mortem diagnostics both as part of criminal differential diagnosis and as part of medical post-mortem diagnostics. The competent and quality performance of post-mortem diagnostics is in many ways affected by organisational and cognitive factors.
   This study presents an analysis of legal arrangements governing the work of post-mortem examination services in Germany, Austria, Croatia and Slovenia, and identifies good and bad practices on the basis of professional opinions expressed by experts working in the field of criminal investigation and forensic medicine in comparable countries. Results and findings represent a useful basis for the formulation of a proposal for a new model of post-mortem examination service presented in the last section of this paper. The proposed model provides a basis for achieving qualitative progress in the field of post-mortem diagnostics not only in Slovenia but also in other countries of continental Europe.

AB Using adolescent samples from four cultures, the current study tested whether effects by religiosity on deviance varied by the nature of religiosity (intrinsic versus extrinsic) and by the cultural context (Bosnia & Herzegovina, Serbia, Slovenia, and the U.S.). Results indicated: a) that not every type of religiosity has a buffering effect on deviance - if one's religiousness is predominately instrumental (i.e. extrinsic), then its inhibiting effect is weak or does not exist; b) that the effect of intrinsic religiosity seemed more pronounced in the two surroundings that expressed the highest mean religiosity (U.S., Bosnia & Herzegovina) although results from follow-up analysis (Z-tests) largely supported a cultural invariance hypothesis. In addition, the intrinsic religiosity-deviance link was moderated by low self-control in each sample, except the Slovenian one. Finally, results indicated that low self-control only partially mediated the religiosity-deviance link. (C) 2011 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

AB An estimated 800 000 suicide deaths occur worldwide. The global suicide rate is 11.4 per 100 000 population; 15.0/100 000 for males and 8.0/100 000 for females. Globally, suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15-29 year olds. In a collaborative effort to reduce the high rates of suicide and mental health problems among youth across Europe, the European Union 7(th) Framework funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. SEYLE is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to promote mental health and healthy lifestyles, while preventing psychopathology and suicidal behaviours among adolescents. The epidemiological data on 11,110 pupils in the age group 14-16 years, with a mean age of 14.8 years (SD +/- 0.8), who were recruited from 168 schools across 10 European Union countries: Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain, with Sweden as the coordinating centre showed the following prevalences: alcohol use (13.4%), smoking (30.9%), physical inactivity (32.8%), pathological Internet use (4.4%) and sleeping on average 7.7 hours per night. In terms of reproductive health, the prevalence of sexual debut was 18.8% for the total sample. Pupils aged >= 16 years had a higher prevalence (38%) of sexual debut compared to those aged <= 15 years (13.2%). Males had a higher prevalence (21.3%) than females (16.9%). Three clusters of adolescents were identified: 57.8% with low frequency of all risk-behaviours; 13.2% with high frequency of all risk behaviours; and 29% so-called `invisible' risk group, which did not show any striking externalised risk behaviours, but scored positive for high use of Internet/TV/videogames, sedentary behaviour and reduced sleep. When comparing pupils in the `invisible' risk group with those in the high-risk group, similar prevalence rates of anxiety (8% vs. 9.2%), subthreshold depression (33.2% vs. 34%), depression (13.4% vs. 14.7%) and suicidal thoughts (42.2% vs. 44%) were observed. Pupils meeting the criteria of depression and subthreshold depression were 10.5% and 32%, respectively. Prevalence rates for anxiety and subthreshold anxiety was 5.8% and 29.2%, respectively. Lifetime prevalence of deliberate self-injurious behaviours (D-SIB) was 27.6%, with higher rates reported for occasional D-SIB (19.7%) compared to repetitive D-SIB (7.8%). Suicidal ideation was present in approximately one third of the sample (32.3%). More than four percent (4.2%) of the sample reported attempting suicide during their lifetime, with a significantly higher prevalence among girls (5.1% vs. 3.0%, p<0.05). In comparing the effectiveness of the three active SEYLE interventions, based on three specific preventive strategies directed towards teachers and school staff, professionals and pupils in comparison to a control group, the intervention empowering pupils, called the Youth Aware of Mental Health (YAM) showed significant results in preventing new cases of suicide attempts, severe suicidal ideation with plans and depression. More than a 50% reduction of incident cases of suicide attempts (OR: 0.45 [0.24 - 0.85]; p=0.014), and of incident cases of severe suicidal ideation and plans (OR: 0.50 [0.27 - 0.92]; p=0.025), as well as a significant reduction by 30% of incident cases with moderate to severe depression (OR: 0.71 [0.52- 0.97]; p=0.031) was observed.

AB Background: Although effective treatment is available for a variety of mental disorders, the treatment and help-seeking gap remains high. One of the main obstacles to help-seeking behaviour is prevailing stigmatizing attitudes.
   Aim: To examine attitudes within the general population towards seeking professional help in times of mental distress.
   Methods: A representative general population survey (N=594) was conducted in Slovenia by means of an Internet-based questionnaire, covering data on demographic variables and attitudes towards help-seeking behaviour.
   Results: More stigmatizing attitudes towards help-seeking behaviour were found in men, single persons, those of a younger age and lower educational achievement and in respondents coming from regions with a high suicide rate. Furthermore, 52.50% of the total sample have had an experience with psychological problems, yet only 41.50% of those have sought professional help. Experience with help-seeking behaviour in the past was associated with less stigmatizing attitudes.
   Conclusion: Knowledge and understanding of mental health problems are necessary prerequisites to seeking help, but not the only ones. To improve help-seeking behaviour, it is also important to combat stigmatizing attitudes. Additionally, destigmatizing campaigns should also focus on social norms.

   ATC/DDD methodology
ID DRUGS
AB Background: The ratio of anxiolytics to antidepressants is an indicator of the quality of treatment of depression and anxiety in primary care. The objective of the study was to investigate the prescription of anxiolytics and antidepressants among Slovenian family physicians, including patient demographics and possible time-trends.
   Subjects and methods: An exploratory survey and register-based analysis of anxiolytic and antidepressant prescriptions in 2005 and 2008 was performed. Drugs included in the study were classified according to an Anatomical-Therapeutic-Chemical (ATC) drug classification system, and ATC data were used to calculate defined daily doses (DDD) per 1,000 practice population per day. Descriptive analysis of anxiolytic/antidepressant ratio by patients' age, gender and region of residency was performed.
   Results: Total amount of prescribed antidepressant drugs increased by 45% during the observed 3-year period, while total prescribing of anxiolytics decreased by 14%, leading to the anxiolytics/antidepressants ratio diminishing from 1 to about 0.5. The highest reduction in the ratio was observed in the northeast region, characterised by high social deprivation and one of the highest suicide rates in Europe. The highest prescribing of anxiolytics and antidepressants was observed in the central region around the capital Ljubljana.
   Conclusions: The reduction of anxiolytic prescribing and increase in antidepressant prescribing indicates improvement in prescribing practice of Slovenian family physicians. There are big variations in prescribing among different Slovenian regions, which are attributable to the number of psychiatrists and access to psychiatric treatment.

AB The purpose of the article is to identify and analyse concrete forms of connections between mass gambling and crime. The concept of gambling is defined as an integral part of the contemporary touristic offer. Two basic trends or types of gambling are described in detail, American and European, and their basic characteristics explained. The central part of the article is devoted to an analysis of the social and economic consequences of gambling, with an emphasis on the American type of gambling, a professional term for mass gambling. In dealing with the social consequences of gambling, the authors highlight in particular changes in the demographic structure of the population, changes of values and attitudes towards gambling, traffic, public services, problem gambling, family disruption and suicide. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the relationship between gambling and crime and presents basic criminological theories that explain a hypothetical causal effect of the link between gambling and crime. In an analysis of the potential economic and social impact of the construction of a large gambling and entertainment centre in the Gorizia region, Slovenia, which was carried out with the methodology of the National Opinion Research Center from the USA, the authors devoted particular attention to investigation of the social costs of gambling. In the conclusion, the authors highlight the positive economic and negative social effects of gambling and its potential impact on crime. The paper also indicates further possibilities of research in this field.

AB Background: Mental health problems and risk behaviours among young people are of great public health concern. Consequently, within the VII Framework Programme, the European Commission funded the Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) project. This Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) was conducted in eleven European countries, with Sweden as the coordinating centre, and was designed to identify an effective way to promote mental health and reduce suicidality and risk taking behaviours among adolescents.
   Objective: To describe the methodological and field procedures in the SEYLE RCT among adolescents, as well as to present the main characteristics of the recruited sample.
   Methods: Analyses were conducted to determine: 1) representativeness of study sites compared to respective national data; 2) response rate of schools and pupils, drop-out rates from baseline to 3 and 12 month follow-up, 3) comparability of samples among the four Intervention Arms; 4) properties of the standard scales employed: Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition (BDI-II), Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (Z-SAS), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), World Health Organization Well-Being Scale (WHO-5).
   Results: Participants at baseline comprised 12,395 adolescents (M/F: 5,529/6,799; mean age=14.9 +/- 0.9) from Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain. At the 3 and 12 months follow up, participation rates were 87.3% and 79.4%, respectively. Demographic characteristics of participating sites were found to be reasonably representative of their respective national population. Overall response rate of schools was 67.8%. All scales utilised in the study had good to very good internal reliability, as measured by Cronbach's alpha (BDI-II: 0.864; Z-SAS: 0.805; SDQ: 0.740; WHO-5: 0.799).
   Conclusions: SEYLE achieved its objective of recruiting a large representative sample of adolescents within participating European countries. Analysis of SEYLE data will shed light on the effectiveness of important interventions aimed at improving adolescent mental health and well-being, reducing risk-taking and self-destructive behaviour and preventing suicidality.
