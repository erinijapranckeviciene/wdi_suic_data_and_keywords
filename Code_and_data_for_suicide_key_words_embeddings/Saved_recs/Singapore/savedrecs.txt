AB The objective of this study was to investigate suicide trends in Singapore between 1955 and 2004. Suicide cases were identified from the Registry of Birth and Death, Singapore, and analyzed using Poisson regression. Overall, suicide rates in Singapore remained stable between 9.8-13.0/100,000 over the last 5 decades. Rates remain highest in elderly males, despite declines among the elderly and middle-aged males in recent years. Rates in ethnic Chinese and Indians were consistently higher than in Malays. While the rates among female Indians and Chinese have declined significantly between 1995 and 2004, some increase was noted in female Malays. Although there was no increase in overall suicide rates, risk within certain population segments has changed over time.

DE Asian; Chinese; older; international; suicide; prevention; ageism
AB Objective: To verify in a systematic study if the Chinese tradition of venerating older people results in lower suicide rates compared to other countries.
   Method: The ratio between suicide rates in the older population and total population were calculated and used to compare 40 countries.
   Results: The highest male suicide ratios in the world were found in Urban China, Singapore, Rural China and Hong Kong. Singapore, Urban China and Hong Kong had the worst female suicide ratios. The highest rate of suicide among females was in Rural China, which also had the highest suicide rate among older people.
   Conclusion: These findings raise questions about the adequacy of support to older Asian people. It is surprising that high suicide rates are found in Hong Kong, Korea, Japan and Singapore, which are affluent societies. The possibility of this being the result of ageism is discussed. Country-specific research is needed to improve suicide prevention measures, especially for older people.

AB One important dynamic risk factor for suicide assessment includes suicide precipitant. This exploratory study used a qualitative paradigm to look into the themes surrounding precipitants for suicide attempts in Singapore. Medical records related to suicide attempters who were admitted to the emergency department of a large teaching hospital in Singapore over a three year period were subjected to analysis. A total of 666 cases were examined (69.2% females; 63.8% Chinese, 15% Malays, 15.8% Indians), ages ranged from 10 years old to 85 years old (Mean = 29.7, Standard Deviation = 16.1). The thematic analysis process that was applied to the textual data elicited key concepts labelled as Relationship issues, Financial strain, Socio-legal-academic environmental stress, and Physical and mental illness and pain. Interpreted with other recent local research on suicide attempters in Singapore, the findings have implications for informing suicide interventions.

AB Introduction: Suicide and parasuicide rates are important markers of the health of a nation. Suicide is a common cause of mortality in youth and parasuicide has its peak prevalence in adolescence and early adulthood. Both pose a tremendous burden to individuals, families and society. Historical and current studies on suicide and parasuicide in Singapore are reviewed and discussed in the light of available worldwide research. Methods: Studies on suicide and parasuicide in Singapore were identified through a MEDLINE search (from 1979). Information from these studies were supplemented with relevant local monographs on suicide and parasuicide. Results: Suicide is extremely rare in children under 10 years of age. Rates rise in the 10 to 14 years age group and increase markedly in the 15 to 19 years age group. The male to female ratio is about 2:1 for youths 10 to 14 years old and 1:1 for the 15 to 19 years age group. The historical preponderance of female suicide is much less clearly seen in recent years. Jumping from a height is the commonest method used, and mental illness and recent life stress are common causative factors. A peak in suicides in the young was found for June and October, and a trough for November and December. Parasuicide is extremely rare in children under 10 years of age. There was a peak in the months of October and November in the student population, corresponding to the examination months. Youths of Indian ethnicity were over-represented. Conclusions: Preventing suicide and parasuicide is of paramount importance, given the severe burden of such acts on individuals, families and society. Current studies on youth suicide in Singapore and a national study on parasuicide are urgently needed to increase our understanding of these phenomena.

AB The objective of this study was to understand the features of young suicide in order to contribute to suicide prevention efforts. In this article, the demographic, clinical, and suicide-related features of all cases of young suicide (aged 10-24 years) in Singapore for the years 2000-2004 are described. We also compared those who sought mental health services to those who did not. Overall, the suicide rate was 5.7 per 100, 000, with gender ratio of 1:1 and higher rates among ethnic Indians. Psychosocial stressors and suicide by jumping from height were common. Mental health service use was associated with unemployment, previous suicide attempts, family history of suicide, more use of lethal methods, lack of identifiable stressor, and less suicide notes. Suicide prevention efforts should promote awareness of suicide risks and access to mental health services.

DE Singapore; suicide; suicide letters
AB The contents of suicide letters provide insight into the reasons for suicide and the mental states of victims. Coroner court records of 1,721 Singaporean suicides occurring between 2000 and 2004 were reviewed, 398 (23%) of whom left suicide letters. Letter writers tended to be younger, single, and less likely to have mental or physical illness. A reason for suicide was evident in 58%. Major reasons included school and relationship problems in the young, financial and marital problems in adults and physical illnesses in the elderly. Positive sentiment (care/concern) was expressed in 59%. Negative emotions in 45% of which despondency/agony (60%) was the most common, followed by emptiness (25%), guilt/shame (15%), hopelessness (10%), and anger (3%). The study of these letters suggests that there are combinations of social, psychological and physical factors that influence a person to suicide, all of which are important in the prevention, assessment, and management of suicide.

Indians were over-represented in this sample, as compared with the ethnic distribution in the general population. Ages ranged from 10 to 85 years old (M = 29.7, SD = 16.1). Ethnic differences were found in risk and protective factors, and perceived lethality of suicide attempts. All available variables were subjected to regression analyses for Chinese, Indian and Malay attempters to arrive at parsimonious models for prediction of perceived lethality. The findings were discussed in regards to implications in assessment of suicide risk and primary prevention for the multiethnic society in Singapore.

The model using recognized risk and protective factors was significant in predicting medical lethality, and correctly classified 62.8% of high lethality cases. Only resolution of precipitant made a unique statistical significant contribution. Analysis was separately conducted for males and females. Implications of the findings are discussed.

AB This study examined the ethnic differences in stressors, risk, and protective factors among people who attempted suicide in Singapore. A retrospective chart review of 626 attempted suicide cases at a hospital in Singapore between 2004 and 2006 collected information on diagnosis according to DSM-IV-TR criteria. Chi-square tests was used to compare the sociodemographic characteristics, stressors, risk factors, and protective factors among Chinese, Malay, Indian, and other ethnic groups. Logistic regression was used to determine the odds ratios of having two or more stressors, risk factors, or protective factors for the four ethnic groups. Women were more likely than men to attempt suicide, although they also were more likely to have two or more suicide protective factors than men. In general, older people were more likely to have two or more suicide risk factors than the younger groups. Ethnic differences were found in history of psychiatric illnesses and unemployment among the risk factors, and for most of the protective factors, but none of the stressors. Indians were more likely to have two or more protective factors than were Chinese (OR of 7.74, 95% CI [1.04, 8.72]. Future suicide prevention programs should target young adults and strengthen the protective factors among different ethnic groups.

AB In 1997-1998 a widespread economic crisis hit the economies of many East/Southeast Asian countries; its impact on suicide rates across the region has not been systematically documented. We investigated the impact of the Asian economic crisis (1997-1998) on suicide in Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Thailand. Suicide and population data for the period 1985-2006 were extracted from the World Health Organisation's mortality database and Taiwanese mortality statistics. Sex-specific age-standardised suicide rates for people aged 15 years or above were analysed using joinpoint regression. Trends in divorce, marriage, unemployment, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and alcohol consumption were compared with trends in suicide rates graphically and using time-series analysis. Suicide mortality decreased in the late 1980s and early 1990s but subsequently increased markedly in all countries except Singapore, which had steadily declining suicide rates throughout the study period. Compared to 1997, male rates in 1998 rose by 39% in Japan, 44% in Hong Kong and 45% in Korea; rises in female rates were less marked. Male rates also rose in Thailand, but accurate data were incomplete. The economic crisis was associated with 10,400 more suicides in 1998 compared to 1997 in Japan, Hong Kong and Korea. Similar increases in suicide rates were not seen in Taiwan and Singapore, the two countries where the economic crisis had a smaller impact on GDP and unemployment. Time-series analyses indicated that some of the crisis's impact on male suicides was attributable to increases in unemployment. These findings suggest an association of the Asian economic crisis with a sharp increase in suicide mortality in some, but not all, East/Southeast Asian countries, and that these increases were most closely associated with rises in unemployment.

ID DEPRESSION; REGISTER
AB Introduction: Maternal mortality in Singapore, as in other developed countries, has remained low in the past decade. In the United Kingdom and Australia, maternal deaths from suicide and psychiatric causes have been the leading cause of maternal mortality, and there have therefore been comprehensive healthcare programmes to address the mental health needs of mothers.
   Methods: In this study, we looked at maternal deaths from 2000 to 2004, by linking coronial cases of female suicide in the reproductive age group 15-45 years, with the birth registration database, to identify both early and late maternal deaths.
   Results: There was only one identified maternal death among 589 female suicides aged 15-45 years, occurring in a teenager within the first month postpartum. There was likely also another case that was unconfirmed and unreported.
   Conclusion: From this preliminary study, suicide and psychiatric causes are not significant causes of maternal mortality in Singapore. However, given that the epidemiology of postnatal depression statistics mirror that of the other countries, it is possible that maternal suicides have been under-reported, and the load may well be higher. There is a need for a similar confidential enquiry into maternal deaths to be set up here, as is already in place in various countries, notably the United Kingdom and Australia, for the past decade.

AB An important risk factor for suicide assessment is the suicide precipitant. This study explores suicide attempt precipitants across the lifespan. Three years of medical records related to suicide attempters who were admitted to the emergency department of a large teaching hospital in Singapore were subjected to analysis. These cases were divided into three age groups: Adolescence, Early Adulthood, and Middle Adulthood. A total of 540 cases were examined (70.9% females; 63.7% Chinese, 13.7% Malays, 15.9% Indians), whose ages ranged from 12 to 62. There were eight cases above the age of 65 years which were excluded from the analysis. Significant differences were found in precipitants for suicide attempts across the lifespan. Middle adults had relatively fewer relationship problems, and adolescents had comparatively fewer financial and medical problems. The models to predict medically severe attempts across the age groups using suicide precipitants were not significant. The findings were discussed in regards to implications in suicide assessment and primary prevention in Singapore, as well as limitations and recommendations for future research.

AB This study provides an analysis of 640 completed suicide cases in Singapore for the years 2001 and 2002, compared to previous years and in relation to demographic and socioeconomic factors, as well as to the characteristics of a subgroup of suicide victims with prior psychiatric illness. There was little change in the suicide pattern over the 2 years studied compared to previous years. The sex ratio was constant at 1.5. Population-adjusted ratios were 1 for Chinese, 0.5 for Malays, and > 1 for both Indians and other ethnic groups. Falling from heights ranked first in terms of method adopted for both years. A disproportionately higher number of suicides were recorded for the 25-34 and the >= 75-year-old age groups. A total of 47 (17.2%) in 2001 and 74 (20.2%) in 2002 of the cases had a history of prior psychiatric illness, with psychotic disorders being the most common diagnostic category. There was also a statistically significant correlation between unemployment and incidence rates. Although the overall rate of elderly suicides had gone down since the 1990s, prevention strategy should focus on the elderly as this rate is still about 3-4 times the national average.

Those who jumped were more likely to be young, single, female, and to have had a major mental illness. By comparison, those who hung themselves were more likely to be older (OR 2.68), Indian (OR 2.32), and to leave a suicide note (OR 1.53). Those who used poison were more likely to be married (OR 2.33), to be on antidepressants (OR 2.40), to have previously attempted suicide (OR 2.13), and to leave a letter (OR 2.30). The choice was determined by accessibility, acceptability, generational, gender, and racial factors.

AB Suicide is a common and preventable event that is often reported by the media when there are sensationalistic elements or if the suicide involves a celebrity. Media reports of suicide can induce a copycat or "Werther effect". There is increasing evidence that sensationalistic reporting of suicides has a direct effect on increasing suicide rates. Responsible reporting guidelines drawn up in consultation with media professionals have been shown to improve reporting of suicides. Local reporting on suicides tends to be sensationalistic but also has a strong educational slant. The media should educate both the public and the medical professional about their role in suicide prevention.

AB This study examined the impact of a history of suicidal behavior on suicide among elderly people in Singapore. In this coroner register-based study, characteristics of 409 elderly people who died of suicide in Singapore between 2000 and 2004 were examined. Sixty-five people were classified with a history of previous suicidal behavior and 344 people without a history of suicidal behavior. Elderly people who died of suicide and had a past history of suicidal behavior were more likely to suffer from major psychiatric disorders (26.2% vs 10.2%, p=0.001), encounter social problems in life (33.9% vs 21.5%, p=0.038), have alcohol detected in the blood toxicology report at autopsy (23.1% vs. 12.8%, p=0.036), receive psychiatric treatment in the past (60% vs. 37.5%, p<0.001), have antidepressant detected in the blood toxicology report at autopsy (16.9% vs. 8.1%, p=0.037), and be admitted to a mental hospital under the mental health legislation (36.9% vs. 11.6%, p<0.001). Conversely, those without a past history of suicidal behavior were more likely to have a pre-suicidal plan for the fatal suicide act (11.1% vs. 1.5%, p=0.011) and have received medical or surgical treatment in the past (22.1% vs. 9.2%, p=0.018). For suicide prevention in Asians, psychiatrists should aggressively treat major psychiatric disorders, engage social services to resolve social problems in elderly people with a history of suicidal behavior, and reduce access to alcohol. Clinicians working in medical or surgical departments should routinely screen for suicide plans in elderly patients without a past history of suicidal behavior.

AB Background: This study explores differences in characteristics of overdose (OD) and non-overdose (NOD) suicide attempts in Singapore.
   Methods: Four hundred eighty-five medical records of people who attempted suicide were extracted from a local general hospital patient database and classified into OD and NOD groups. Differences in socio-demographic factors, suicide characteristics and hospital admission types between both groups were examined.
   Results: Indians were more likely than the Chinese and Malays to employ OD method in their attempts. More suicide attempts in the OD group than NOD group were self-reported. The most likely place for suicide attempts for both groups was at home, though more NOD suicide attempts were in public areas as compared to the OD group. Analgesics were the most used substance in the OD group. Those who attempted suicide using OD had a higher number of psychiatric ward admissions than the NOD group. Risk and protective factors varied between both groups.
   Conclusion: Differences in socio-demographics, suicide characteristics and admission characteristics between OD and NOD groups were observed. Recommendations for suicide prevention in the community are discussed. Further studies on the mediators and moderators of these trends and characteristics of suicide attempts are necessary to ensure maximal efficacy of prevention and management.

ID OLDER
AB Background There are a few reports on the trends of elderly suicide rates in western countries but none from Asian countries.
   Objectives To describe the trends of elderly suicide rates of Chinese, Malays and Indians in Singapore from 101 to 2000.
   Design Data obtained from the National Department of Statistics were used in the analysis of sex- and age-standardized suicide rates and relative risks.
   Results Overall, the suicide rates for the elderly showed a decline from 40.1 per 100,000 in 1990 to 17.8 per 100,000 in 2000, with the most pronounced decline occurring from 1995 to 2000. The suicide rate for elderly Chinese was at a peak of 52 per 100,000 in 1995 and declined to 20 per 100,000 in 2000. The rates for elderly Malays were consistently low at 2.2 per 100,000 for the 10 years; for elderly Indians the rates were between the other two ethnic groups.
   Conclusion In the 10-year period, the elderly suicide rates in Singapore declined markedly, especially for elderly Chinese. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Background. Mental illness is a pertinent risk factor related to suicide. However, research indicates there might be underdiagnosis of mental illness in Asian suicide attempters; this phenomenon is concerning. This study explored prediction of diagnosis of mental illness in suicide attempters in Singapore using available variables. Methods. Three years of medical records related to suicide attempters (N = 462) who were admitted to the emergency department of a large teaching hospital in Singapore were subjected to analysis. Of the sample, 25% were diagnosed with mental illness; 70.6% were females and 29.4% were males; 62.6% were Chinese, 15.4% Malays, and 16.0% Indians. Their age ranged from 12 to 86 (M = 29.37, SD = 12.89). All available variables were subjected to regression analyses. Findings. The full model was significant in predicting cases with and without diagnosis of mental illness and accurately classified 79% of suicide attempters with diagnosis of mental illness. Conclusions. The findings were discussed in regard to clinical implications in diagnosis and primary prevention.

ID ENGLAND; WALES
AB In this study, recent trends in the incidence and methods of suicide in Singapore, over the period 1991-2000, were compared with the results of a previous study covering the period 1975-1984 (Tan, 1986). The present study included a total of 3,834 suicidal deaths reported to the coroner and investigated by the Centre for Forensic Medicine of the Health Sciences Authority. The results showed that the crude suicide rate had stabilised over the last decade and that the rate was highest among elderly males. The three most common methods employed were falls from a height (69.3%), hanging (20.7%) and poisoning (5.5%).
   Comparison of the results of both studies showed that the crude suicide rate had stabilised over the last two decades. However, there was an increase in the suicide rates among males, as compared with the previous study, and a marginal decrease in suicide rates among females over this time. There was also an appreciable change in the methods of suicide employed, in that there was an increase in the proportion of deaths due to falls from a height and corresponding reductions in the proportions of deaths by hanging and poisoning.

TI Regional Changes in Charcoal-Burning Suicide Rates in East/Southeast

SO PLOS MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article

AB Background
   Suicides by carbon monoxide poisoning resulting from burning barbecue charcoal reached epidemic levels in Hong Kong and Taiwan within 5 y of the first reported cases in the early 2000s. The objectives of this analysis were to investigate (i) time trends and regional patterns of charcoal-burning suicide throughout East/Southeast Asia during the time period 1995-2011 and (ii) whether any rises in use of this method were associated with increases in overall suicide rates. Sex- and age-specific trends over time were also examined to identify the demographic groups showing the greatest increases in charcoal-burning suicide rates across different countries.
   Methods and Findings
   We used data on suicides by gases other than domestic gas for Hong Kong, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore in the years 1995/1996-2011. Similar data for Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand were also extracted but were incomplete. Graphical and joinpoint regression analyses were used to examine time trends in suicide, and negative binomial regression analysis to study sex- and age-specific patterns. In 1995/1996, charcoal-burning suicides accounted for <1% of all suicides in all study countries, except in Japan (5%), but they increased to account for 13%, 24%, 10%, 7%, and 5% of all suicides in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore, respectively, in 2011. Rises were first seen in Hong Kong after 1998 (95% CI 1997-1999), followed by Singapore in 1999 (95% CI 1998-2001), Taiwan in 2000 (95% CI 1999-2001), Japan in 2002 (95% CI 1999-2003), and the Republic of Korea in 2007 (95% CI 2006-2008). No marked increases were seen in Malaysia, the Philippines, or Thailand. There was some evidence that charcoal-burning suicides were associated with an increase in overall suicide rates in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan (for females), but not in Japan (for males), the Republic of Korea, and Singapore. Rates of change in charcoal-burning suicide rate did not differ by sex/age group in Taiwan and Hong Kong but appeared to be greatest in people aged 15-24 y in Japan and people aged 25-64 y in the Republic of Korea. The lack of specific codes for charcoal-burning suicide in the International Classification of Diseases and variations in coding practice in different countries are potential limitations of this study.
   Conclusions
   Charcoal-burning suicides increased markedly in some East/Southeast Asian countries (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore) in the first decade of the 21st century, but such rises were not experienced by all countries in the region. In countries with a rise in charcoal-burning suicide rates, the timing, scale, and sex/age pattern of increases varied by country. Factors underlying these variations require further investigation, but may include differences in culture or in media portrayals of the method.

   Editors' Summary
   Editors' Summary
   Background
   Every year, almost one million people die by suicide globally; suicide is the fifth leading cause of death in women aged 15-49 and the sixth leading cause of death in men in the same age group. Most people who take their own life are mentally ill. For others, stressful events (the loss of a partner, for example) have made life seem worthless or too painful to bear.
   Strategies to reduce suicide rates include better treatment of mental illness and programs that help people at high risk of suicide deal with stress. Suicide rates can also be reduced by limiting access to common suicide methods. These methods vary from place to place. Hanging is the predominant suicide method in many countries, but in Hong Kong, for example, jumping from a high building is the most common method. Suicide methods also vary over time. For example, after a woman in Hong Kong took her life in 1998 by burning barbecue charcoal in a sealed room (a process that produces the toxic gas carbon monoxide), charcoal burning rapidly went from being a rare method of killing oneself in Hong Kong to the second most common suicide method.
   Why Was This Study Done? ?
   Cases of charcoal-burning suicide have also been reported in several East and Southeast Asian countries, but there has been no systematic investigation of time trends and regional patterns of this form of suicide. A better understanding of regional changes in the number of charcoal-burning suicides might help to inform efforts to prevent the emergence of other new suicide methods. Here, the researchers investigate the time trends and regional patterns of charcoal-burning suicide in several countries in East and Southeast Asia between 1995 and 2011 and ask whether any rises in the use of this method are associated with increases in overall suicide rates. The researchers also investigate sex- and age-specific time trends in charcoal-burning suicides to identify which groups of people show the greatest increases in this form of suicide across different countries.
   What Did the Researchers Do and Find? ?
   The researchers analyzed method-specific data on suicide deaths for Hong Kong, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore between 1995/1996 and 2011 obtained from the World Health Organization Mortality Database and from national death registers. In 1995/1996, charcoal-burning suicides accounted for less than 1% of all suicides in all these countries except Japan (4.9%). By 2011, charcoal-burning suicides accounted for between 5% (Singapore) and 24% (Taiwan) of all suicides. Rises in the rate of charcoal-burning suicide were first seen in Hong Kong in 1999, in Singapore in 2000, in Taiwan in 2001, in Japan in 2003, and in the Republic of Korea in 2008. By contrast, incomplete data from Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand showed no evidence of a marked increase in charcoal-burning suicide in these countries over the same period. Charcoal-burning suicides were associated with an increase in overall suicide rates in Hong Kong in 1998-2003, in Taiwan in 2000-2006, and in Japanese women after 2003. Finally, the annual rate of change in charcoal-burning suicide rate did not differ by sex/age group in Taiwan and Hong Kong, whereas in Japan people aged 15-24 and in the Republic of Korea people aged 25-64 tended to have the greatest rates of increase.
   What Do These Findings Mean? ?
   These findings show that charcoal-burning suicides increased markedly in several but not all East and Southeast Asian countries during the first decade of the 21st century. Moreover, in countries where there was an increase, the timing, scale, and sex/age pattern of the increase varied by country. The accuracy of these findings is likely to be limited by several aspects of the study.
   For example, because of the way that method-specific suicides are recorded in the World Health Organization Mortality Database and national death registries, the researchers may have slightly overestimated the number of charcoal-burning suicides. Further studies are now needed to identify the factors that underlie the variations between countries in charcoal-burning suicide rates and time trends reported here. However, the current findings highlight the need to undertake surveillance to identify the emergence of new suicide methods and the importance of policy makers, the media, and internet service providers working together to restrict graphic and detailed descriptions of new suicide methods.

AB Objective: Persons with psychiatric illness, especially depression and schizophrenia, are at relatively high risk of suicide, but there are few studies that look at the Asian population. The aim of the present study was to identify the risk period and risk factors for suicide in psychiatric patients in Singapore. The nature of psychiatric care that was provided, both inpatient and outpatient, was also explored.
   Method: This is a case-control study of 123 patients who committed suicide from 2003 to 2004. Controls were 123 surviving patients who were individually matched for age, gender, principal diagnosis and calendar time.
   Results: The most common principal diagnoses among the suicide subjects were schizophrenia (46.3%) and depression (26.8%). Numerous factors were associated with significantly increased suicide risk. Stepwise conditional logistic regression showed that the following three independent factors best predicted suicide: history of attempted suicide using highly lethal means; coexisting significant physical illness; and delusions. Suicides occur mainly soon after discharge and after an outpatient consult. Subgroup analyses were done to distinguish between subjects who suicided early and late following discharge.
   Conclusions: Suicidal risk remains high in Singaporean psychiatric patients soon after discharge. They share some common risk factors for suicide identified in Western studies but the lower prevalence of substance abuse and comorbidity in Singaporean suicide subjects was one notable difference. The phenomena of suicides soon after discharge and outpatient review suggest the need for proper identification and more intensive follow up during this period.

DT Article
DE Asian; child and adolescent suicide; gender; life stressors
ID RISK-FACTORS; IDEATION
AB Aims: This study explored gender differences in life stressors of children and adolescents who died by suicide. Three main classes of life stressors have been identified by previous research to be significant risk factors for suicide in children and adolescents: interpersonal/relationship problems, family problems, and academic/school problems. Methods: The sample consisted of 156 (89 males and 67 females) completed child and adolescent suicides in Singapore from 1995 to 2003. The age of these individuals ranged from 10 to 19 years with a mean age of 16.49 (SD = 2.59). Results: Significantly more females were found to have had interpersonal/ relationship problems as recent life stressors compared with males. No gender differences were found for the other two life stressors, family problems and academic/school problems. In addition, among the three life stressors studied, only interpersonal/relationship problems emerged as a significant predictor of female child and adolescent suicide. Conclusions: Consistent with previous research literature, these findings contribute to a growing literature documenting the relatively larger impact of relational life stressors on child and adolescent female suicidality. Implications for suicide intervention and prevention, especially among young females, were discussed.

AB Objective: The ageing population in Singapore is expected to grow to 25% by 2030. As the incidence of late-onset major psychiatric problems might be increasing, there was numerous psychopathology that was associated with the depression, including catatonia. This case report aims to demystify the impression that catatonia is disappearing in the developed countries. Methods: We reported two cases of catatonia secondary to major depressive disorder presenting within six weeks of each other in a large teaching hospital in Singapore. Results: These two cases highlight the occurrence of catatonia in late-onset depressive disorder requiring early recognition and prompt treatment. Conclusion: Cases of major depression with catatonia cannot be overlooked in an elderly population. Catatonia increases premature death, including suicide. Timely identification and treatment are crucial to prevent medical complications and suicide.

AB Suicide is a major problem worldwide, and suicides in Asian countries account for as much as 60% of all suicides in the world. There are many unique features in suicides within this ethnically-diverse continent, from the methods used, to the putative risk factors. Much research still needs to be done to guide efficacious and culturally relevant interventions in suicide prevention; existing literature suggests a strong focus for programmes that address restricting access to pesticides, increasing crisis counseling activities, improving the accessibility and delivery of mental health services, and promoting responsible media reporting of suicide and related issues. There is a need for coordinated national suicide plans to be developed that are sensitive to the socioeconomic and cultural factors in the local context.

AB Adolescent suicide is considered a worldwide problem and an increasing source of concern in Singapore. This study explores the relationships among four factors of maladjustment (that is, emotional distress, negative self, antisocial behavior, and anger control problems) and suicidal ideation in two hundred and seventy-one adolescents from Singapore. Findings from the study indicated that emotional distress, negative self-concept, and antisocial behavior significantly predicted suicidal ideation for the whole sample. Beta weight is largest for emotional distress, followed by negative self, and then antisocial behavior. For females, only emotional distress significantly predicted suicidal ideation. For males, only negative self-concept significantly predicted suicidal ideation. Implications of these findings with regard to working with adolescents with suicidal ideations are discussed.

AB Objective: To assess the outcome and predictors of patients with schizophrenia 20 years later.
   Method: The patients, aged 15-39 years, with diagnosis of schizophrenia and first admitted to a national mental hospital in Singapore in 1975 were included. In 1980, 1985, 1990 and 1995, their hospital records were examined and the patients were interviewed to determine their working and treatment status. Possible predictors of good outcome and suicide data were determined.
   Results: A total of 402 patients were included. Over 20 years, there was lower percentage of patients working full time and proportionately more patients were receiving out-patient treatment. Overall, about two-third of the patients had a good/fair outcome. Shorter illness duration before admission was significantly associated with a good outcome. The suicide rate was the highest in the first 10 years.
   Conclusion: Most patients with schizophrenia had a good/fair outcome at 20 years.

AB This study explored medical doctors' clinical assessment of suicide risk and suicide attempters' self-reported suicide intent. Three years of archival assessment records related to suicide attempters who were admitted to the emergency department of a large teaching hospital in Singapore were subjected to analysis. Records related to 460 suicide attempters (70.4% females; 28.6% males) were analysed using logistic regressions. Their ages ranged from 12 to 85 (M = 29.08, SD = 12.86). The strongest predictor of suicide intent was habitual poor coping, followed by serious financial problems, and expressed regret. The strongest predictor of suicide risk was hiding the attempt followed by prior planning. The findings were discussed in regards to implications in clinical assessments and suicide prevention efforts.

ID BRIDGE; RATES; BARRIERS; SINGAPORE; ENGLAND
AB Research on suicide by jumping is summarized. The incidence of suicide by this method varies but tends to be higher in cities, city states, or countries that have extensive high-rise housing. Most suicides by jumping occur from high-rise residential housing units. However, our knowledge about suicide by jumping tends to be limited to a small number of reports from sites, often bridges, which become well-known as places from which to take one's life. Media reports of newsworthy suicides from these sites appear to encourage imitative behavior. Prevention strategies have focused upon limiting suicides from iconic sites by surveillance, barriers, muted media reporting, and signage offering help and telephone hotlines. A small number of studies provides evidence that installing barriers at popular jumping sites reduces suicides from those sites. There are few reports of efforts to reduce suicides from high-rise residential buildings.

AB Introduction: Studies on suicide rate in the elderly have shown vast differences in different regions. This review summarizes the literature on the elderly suicide trend in Chinese populations, namely China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore, comparing these data to those in the USA and the UK. Methods: We reviewed 22 articles which we retrieved from a computerized search on elderly suicide in Chinese population from the above four regions. Results: These studies reported a general downward trend in elderly suicide, with higher rates in the Asian Chinese population. These studies also reported a higher rate of elderly male suicide compared to elderly female, with hanging being the most common method in urban areas. Discussion: Looking into suicide prevention programs and their relationship with the suicide trend, we hope to bring across a strong message that suicide is preventable. We also hope to encourage more research in this field, especially in preventive medicine, targeting at-risk individuals in the community.

AB A retrospective study of suicides in Brunei Darussalam (Brunei) over a 20 year period from 1991e2010 was conducted by analysing the post-mortem examination and external examination reports and other relevant records. The suicide rate in Brunei is very low (1.9 deaths per 100,000 per year). The majority of the victims were expatriates 82(66%) and hanging was the commonest mode of suicide both in expatriate and local population. The study showed that the suicide rate among the Bruneian Malays was the lowest (0.5 deaths per 100,000 per year) among the different nationalities. The study highlights the demographics and socio-economic background of the victims, methods used in committing suicide, suicide rates in different ethnic groups and predisposing factors. The results of this study would be of use for taking preventive measures to minimize the incidence of suicide. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine. All rights reserved.

DE Suicide; Funeral ritual; Singapore; Chinese diaspora
AB In this article, I examine how Singaporean Chinese families and funeral professionals work together to ritually manage the meaning and consequences of a death by suicide. While the now dated literature on Chinese mortuary practice emphasizes the formality and rigidity of death rituals, during fieldwork I noted many moments of confusion within ritual, moments of innovation, when relatives broke away from the already uncertain ritual script, and moments of deceit, when relatives conspired with funeral directors to hide the reason for a death. Through an examination of three funerals for suicide victims, including two cases in which the fact that the death was a suicide was hidden, I suggest that a focus on moments of confusion and of innovation paradoxically better captures the dynamism and efficacy of Chinese funeral rituals: here indeterminacy is indispensable to ritual form.

Graphs of these patterns largely remained either upward-sloping, bimodal or flat (uniform) over the 36 years, male commonly differing from female, and East Asian patterns more like each other than those of the Western countries. Japan's male middle-aged suicide rate reached a peak in 1999-2003, which, like increased rates among working age males in Hong Kong and Taiwan, has been attributed largely to consequences of Asian financial crises. Male to female ratios of suicide rates have remained higher in the Western countries, but late life suicide rates have decreased to varying extents in all five jurisdictions. Identifying reasons for differences between jurisdictions in their suicide rates and patterns at particular times, and over time, is likely to point to factors (period, cohort, psychosocial or cultural) that protect against or foster suicidal ideation. This avenue of research may assist in identifying ways of preventing suicide.

AB The functions of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and DSM-IV-TR diagnoses were examined in a sample of thirty ethnic adolescents followed up in a local child and adolescent psychiatric clinic in Singapore. The most commonly endorsed function of NSSI on the Functional Assessment of Self-Mutilation scale was Automatic Negative Reinforcement (A-NR) and the least being Social Negative Reinforcement (S-NR). Participants were more likely to be diagnosed as having Major Depression Disorder. Depressed adolescents did not differ from non-depressed counterparts in their endorsement of social reinforcement functions. The results suggest that specific psychosocial interventions may help address both automatic and social functions of NSSI in Singapore adolescents. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB One widely accepted narrative in Singapore concerns access and reads thus: education is the main vehicle for upward income mobility. Students are sorted into Normal and Express programmes through the Primary School Leaving Examinations at 12 years of age. Academic overachievement is the socially validated norm. Rising incidents of youth suicide and depression in recent years have been attributed to academic stress. I explore the messy temporalities of hope and propose that hope is created when imaginations of the future are not constrained by the parameters of access.

AB The aim of the present study was to review international literature on the incidence of suicide on railway networks, describe risk factors associated with it, and examine existing prevention practices. Searches on Medline and PsycINFO for the period 1966-2007 were performed. Thirty original studies published in English on epidemiology of rail suicide were included in the review along with peer-reviewed articles on risk factors and prevention of rail suicide. Internationally, suicide by collision with a train accounted for 1-12% of all suicides, with up to 94% of all attempts resulting in death. Suicide by train seriously affects not only survivors, but also train drivers and bystanders. Correlations between density of rail network, number of passengers and number of suicides by train have been found. Conflicting data exist on gender ratio of this type of suicide, but studies are homogenous in identifying young adults (20-40 year of age) as those most exposed to train suicide. Documented psychiatric diagnoses were found in up to 83% of cases. Mid-seasonal peaks were also identified, with events occurring mostly during late morning and early afternoon. Limited evidence exists for effective suicide prevention practices. Successful examples are represented by pits and sliding door systems (Singapore Mass Rapid Transit System) and responsible media reporting (Viennese Subway). Suicide by train involves emotional and financial costs to individuals and society as a whole. A combination of different strategies might significantly reduce its effect.

AB Interpersonal needs are associated with suicide. However, no interpersonal needs questionnaire has been validated in Asia. The psychometric properties of the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire were examined in a sample of 340 young male adults in Singapore. This questionnaire measures proximal causes of desire for suicide using the extent to which individuals believe that they are a burden to others (perceived burdensomeness) and the extent to which they believe their needs are not met (thwarted belongingness). Confirmatory factor analysis found that a two-factor model of perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness provided an adequate fit for the data. Internal consistency was excellent. Concurrent, convergent, predictive, and discriminant validity was demonstrated. The findings showed that the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire provides a valid measure of interpersonal needs in young Asian males. Thus, the instrument can be utilized to test the interpersonal psychological theory of suicidal behavior.

AB Social theory generated in and about Singapore lies in psychic depths and archive fevers of an immigrant society subjected to accelerated social changes that devalue the lives of those marked by aging. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in Singapore, weaving together four kinds of data setsgerontology psychiatric research and intervention; changing ritual forms; analytically phenomenological, paraethnographic theater and stories; and student video and drama projectsI argue that new literacies, pedagogies, and practices can foster enriched community life in posttraumatic, aging societies. Focusing on meaning and affect, and referencing Derrida on hauntology, archive fever, sur-vie, and grammatology (as syntax of social configurations within which aging occurs, or, sociocultural texts, narratives, and symbols), I build on the ethnographic literatures on aging and explore strong metaphors of monstrous history (taowu), ghosts (hantu), obliviousness brought by prosperity (fat years), and intercultural repetition compulsions of unfilial children (Lear).

DE Parkinson's disease; suicide
ID OF-LIFE; RISK; COMPLICATIONS; IDEATION
AB BackgroundSuicide is a potentially preventable event. Suicidal ideation is common in Parkinson's disease (PD), but literature on completed suicides is scarce. In this case-control study, we compared the clinical characteristics of PD subjects who completed suicide (case) with those who died from natural causes (control).
   MethodsPD patients from the National Neurosciences Institute's movement disorders database from 2002 till 2012 were identified. The database was linked to the Singapore National Registry of Disease Office for mortality information, and suicide deaths were confirmed with the coroner's office. The demographic and clinical variables were compared between the cases and controls and the significant factors were further analyzed using logistic regression analysis.
   ResultsDuring the study period, 366 deaths were recorded and suicide accounted for 11 deaths. Ten subjects with suicide deaths with complete clinical information were compared with randomly selected 30 PD subjects who had died from natural causes. PD suicide patients were younger (65.9 vs. 74.48 years), had less comorbidities (CWI: 2.6 vs. 4.63), better cognition (MMSE: 25.75 vs. 21.36), lower ON' UPDRS motor scores (20.83 vs. 41.63), lower H &Y stage (2.16 vs. 3.86), and higher use of Entacapone than the PD non-suicide group.
   ConclusionSuicide is potentially preventable tragedy. PD patients with the identified clinical characteristics should be closely monitored for suicide ideations. Motor fluctuation is a treatable factor in such patients and should be aggressively managed.

AB Background: The rapid increase in suicide rates in South Korea, particularly in the aftermath of the Asian economic crisis in the late 1990s, compares with the declining suicide rates observed in most other OECD countries over the same period.
   Aims of the Study: This study aimed to examine an array of macro-level societal factors that might have contributed to the rising suicide trend in South Korea.
   Methods: We first investigated whether this trend was unique to South Korea, or ubiquitous across five Asian countries/areas that are geographically and culturally similar (South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan), using WHO mortality data and national statistics (1980-2009). Age-standardised suicide rates (per 100,000 population) were calculated for each gender and age group (15-24, 25-44, 45-64, and 65+) for each country. Both panel data and country-specific time-series analyses were employed to investigate the impact of economic change and social integration/regulation on suicide.
   Results: Despite similarities in geography and culture, the rising trend of suicide rates was unique to South Korea. This atypical trend was most apparent for people aged 65 and over, which was in sharp contrast to the decreasing suicide trends observed in the other four Asian countries. The results of the panel data analyses generally pointed to a negative relationship between economic growth and suicide rates, particularly for working-aged people. The results of the time-series analyses further suggested that low levels of social integration, as indicated by rising divorce rates, may also have a role in rising suicide rates in South Korea, particularly for older people. Furthermore, the association between suicide rates and economic adversity (unemployment and economic downturn) was most salient among middle-aged men in South Korea.
   Discussion and Limitations: Compared to four other East Asian countries/areas (Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan), South Korea has uniquely experienced a rising trend of suicide rates over the past three decades, particularly among older people. The findings highlight the differential associations between social changes and suicide rates at various stages over a person's life course. Low levels of social integration and economic adversity may in part explain the atypical suicide trend in South Korea, especially for older people and middle-aged men, respectively. Data constraints, however, limit the scope for explanation in light of the complex and multifactorial causes of suicide.
   Implications for Health and Social Care Policies: Different age groups within the population require different policy interventions to curb the unprecedented rise in suicide rates in South Korea. Particularly for older people, there is a great need to strengthen methods of assisting family support as well as formulating models of social care that are financially-sustainable and culturally sensitive. More investment is also needed to strengthen labour market protection and/or expand social safety net for the unemployed.
   Implications for Further Research: The link between social integration and suicide rates deserves further empirical investigation, so that mediating factors that are amenable to policy actions can be better identified.

AB In recent decades, there have been concerted efforts to improve mental health services for youths alongside the challenges of rising healthcare costs and increasing demand for mental health needs. One important phenomenon is the shift from traditional clinic-based care to community-based mental health services to improve accessibility to services and provide patient-centred care. In this article, we discuss the child and adolescent community mental health efforts within the Asia-Pacific region. We also discuss Singapore's community and school-based mental health service, known as the Response, Early Intervention and Assessment in Community Mental Health (REACH). This article discusses how REACH has evolved over the years in response to the changing needs of youths in Singapore. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and future directions for youth mental health care.

AB Asia is the world's largest continent, occupying approximately half the earth's land mass and containing half the world's population. Although ethnically, culturally, economically, and religiously diverse, there are a number of factors common to all Asian countries, as well as some important differences. It is estimated that suicides in Asia contribute 60% to the global one million suicides annually, with three Asian countries (viz. China, India, and Japan) accounting for more than 40% of this figure. Other Asian countries with high suicide rates include Kazakhstan, Sri Lanka, and South Korea. The majority of people dying by suicide in Asia are young, and pesticides are one of the most common methods used. In many Asian countries, the male to female ratio is much narrower and in China it is reversed. Given that there are 10-20 attempts for every completed suicide and at least six people are directly affected by a suicide or a serious attempt, there may be as many as 60 million people in Asia suffering from the consequences of a suicidal act every year, but postvention remains a neglected area in Asia. Due to a variety of legal, socio-cultural, and religious factors suicide rates in many Asian countries are grossly underestimated and there are huge research and knowledge gaps. A fifth of Asian countries either do not collect national mortality statistics on suicide or even if they do, they do not report them to the World Health Organization (WHO). To reduce the enormous burden of suicide in Asia, there is a need for more and better research to inform policy and establish culturally relevant suicide prevention programmes.

ID GENDER-DIFFERENCES; MENTAL-HEALTH; NEED
AB Singapore is now considered to be a developed country. It also has one of the fastest aging populations in the world. Life expectancy at birth in 2007 was 78.2 years for men and 82.9 years for women. The aging population and change in disease patterns with a consequent increase in chronic diseases and disability present a challenge to the health system.
   The frequently observed disparity between statistics for men's and women's health is also seen in Singapore. Men die younger and suffer more illness. Diseases such as cancer, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, sexually transmitted diseases and injuries are more commonly seen among men in the country. Mental health issues are also significant, with men having higher suicide rates than women. These conditions result in years of productive life lost. The results of the Singapore National Health Survey 2004 suggest that more men than women have unhealthy lifestyles which predispose them to chronic diseases.
   Healthcare policy in Singapore emphasizes building a healthy population through preventive healthcare programs and promoting a healthy lifestyle. The Health Promotion Board Singapore is a key driver of health promotion programs in the country. There are over 2000 primary healthcare clinics including 18 government subsidized ones. The uptake of these services and programs depends on men themselves. Traditional models of gender roles could influence the differing attitude of men and women to health with a consequent impact on differing health outcomes between men and women. Facilities providing healthcare and efforts to promote health among men have to consider this. (C) 2009 WPMH GmbH. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Introduction: The expansion in gambling activities over the past decade has made gambling more accessible than ever. This could bring changes in the sociodemographic and clinical profiles of those seeking treatment for pathological gambling.
   Methods: This study examined the differences between two cohorts of 150 patients each, treated at the National Addictions Management Service between 2001 and 2006 (cohort-1) and between 2006 and 2008 (cohort-2), respectively.
   Results: Compared to cohort-1, cohort-2 was significantly younger (p-value less than 0.01), comprised fewer Chinese and were more highly educated (p-value less than 0.05), with no significant difference in gender or marital status. Regarding the type of gambling activities, cohort-2 was more likely to engage in soccer betting (p-value less than 0.01). Although the proportion presenting with any comorbidity remained unchanged, alcohol use disorders had increased more than three-fold and suicide risk was slightly elevated, although not significantly.
   Discussion: Clinicians should undertake routine screening and assessment of alcohol misuse and suicide risk, offering brief interventions, where necessary, for this vulnerable population.

TI Seasonality of suicide in Singapore: data from the equator
SO PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID SEX DIFFERENCE
AB Background. Studies in the northern and southern hemispheres consistently identify seasonal patterns in suicidal deaths. In many such studies, bimodal yearly peaks have been described for females as against unimodal ones for males. The current study examines the monthly variation in suicidal deaths in Singapore to determine if any seasonal patterns exist in an equatorial region.
   Methods. Monthly suicidal death data over the decade 1989-98 were examined for the whole sample and for gender- and age-specific subgroups. Both von Mises' distribution and harmonic analysis techniques were used to interpret the data.
   Results. Among the 2013 male and 1382 female suicides, there was minimal variation in patterning of suicidal deaths. We found a weak suggestion of a later peak for the females in mid-May as opposed to mid-February for the males, and the peaks for those less than 25 years of age were 5-6 months later than for the older age groups. The magnitude of all peaks was, however, very small suggesting chance variation. The harmonic analyses confirmed that patterning was 'randomly' rather than 'seasonally' determined.
   Conclusion. In an equatorial region, there was no evidence of any 'seasonal' patterning of suicidal deaths.

AB Suicide in later life is a global public health problem. The aim of this review was to conduct a systematic analysis of studies with comparison groups that examined the associations between social factors and suicidal behavior (including ideation, non-fatal suicidal behavior, or deaths) among individuals aged 65 and older. Our search identified only 16 articles (across 14 independent samples) that met inclusion criteria. The limited number of studies points to the need for further research. Included studies were conducted in Canada (n = 2), Germany (n = 1), Hong Kong (n = 1), Japan (n = 1), Singapore (n = 1), Sweden (n = 2), Taiwan (n = 1), the U. K. (n = 2), and the U.S. (n = 3). The majority of the social factors examined in this review can be conceptualized as indices of positive social connectedness-the degree of positive involvement with family, friends, and social groups. Findings indicated that at least in industrialized countries, limited social connectedness is associated with suicidal ideation, non-fatal suicidal behavior, and suicide in later life. Primary prevention programs designed to enhance social connections as well as a sense of community could potentially decrease suicide risk, especially among men.

AB This mixed methods study examined the phenomenon of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) of adolescents in Singapore. The researchers analyzed quantitative data to understand the functions of NSSI, the relationship of parental invalidation to NSSI, and the association between academic stress and parental invalidation. In addition, the researchers employed semi-structured qualitative interviews to provide supportive qualitative data. The participants were outpatients at the Child Guidance Clinic, Singapore, between the ages of 13 to 19 years old. Researchers compared 30 participants who engage in NSSI with 30 participants who do not engage in NSSI. The emotional regulation function was the most commonly endorsed function for NSSI. Adolescents who engage in NSSI have statistically significant (p < .01) higher mean parental invalidation scores than those who do not engage in NSSI. There is also a moderate, positive correlation between the level of parental invalidation and the level of academic stress for Singaporean adolescents. The researchers discuss the implications of this study for mental health professionals.

AB Substance use carries a higher risk of unnatural death. A retrospective analysis of 42 treatment seekers between 2011-2015 was conducted through medical record review to understand the profile and circumstances leading to premature deaths. Ninety percent of the subjects were males. The mean age at death was 44.9 (SD +/- 13.1). Opioids (52.4%), benzodiazepines (45.2%) and alcohol (35.7%) were the main substances used by the group. Suicide was the most common cause of death (n = 27, 64.3%) followed by accidents (n = 15; 35.7%). Among the suicide cases, alcohol was the main substance used (33.3%) followed by opioids (25.9%). A total of 58.5% (n = 24) deaths occurred within a year of their last visit while 41.5% (n = 17) were dead more than a year after their last visit. Of the total cases (n = 41), 63% had a history of mental illness with depressive disorder (53.8%) being the most common. History of suicide attempts were reported in 34.1% (n = 14) of cases and 50% of the subjects (n = 21) had a history of suicidal ideation. Drug related offences were reported in 57.1% of the subjects, of which 60% (n = 18) committed suicide. The findings support the need for appropriate treatment resources to reduce the untimely deaths among substance users.

AB Introduction: Studies in the West have concluded that the severity of depression is the strongest predictor of the course of suicidal ideations among the elderly. However, Asian culture tends to be more reserved and this may impact on the reporting of suicidal ideations. This study aims to determine the prevalence of suicidal ideation among depressed elderly people in Singapore and attempts to investigate the relationship between severity of depression and suicidality.
   Method: Eighty consecutive depressed patients were recruited and severity of depressive symptoms rated with Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI). Suicidality was assessed using the Beck's Hopelessness Scale (BHS) and Beck's Suicide Intent Scale (BSS). Suicidal ideation was defined as any thought of wanting to kill oneself over the past seven days and not just a passive wish to die.
   Results: 53.8% verbalized thoughts of wanting to kill themselves. Males were three times more likely to report suicidal thoughts. Severity of depression did not significantly influence the presence of suicidal thinking. The association of depression severity and suicidal ideations is not strongly supported.
   Conclusions: Elderly males were more likely to report suicidal ideations when depressed. Elderly patients who reported suicidal ideations were likely to be more severely depressed. However, in a depressed elderly person, the absence of suicidal ideations would not infer that the episode of depression was less severe.

AB Introduction: Whether final height is associated with quality of life and mental health is a matter of epidemiological and medical concern. Both social and biological explanations have been previously proposed. This study aims to assess the associations in ethnic Chinese in Singapore. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study of 4414 respondents aged at least 21 years seen at a major polyclinic was performed. Socioeconomic and behavioural features of the sample and the Singapore population of similar ages were comparable. Height was measured by clinic nurses using an ultrasonic height senor. Participants were interviewed for socioeconomic, behavioural, health and quality of life information. Clinical morbidity data was collected from the participants' treating physicians. The SF-6D utility index and its Mental Health domain were the main endpoints. Linear and ordinal logistic regression models were used to analyse the utility index and the Mental Health scores, respectively. Results: Having adjusted for age and gender, the Mental Health domain (P<0.01) was associated with height but the utility index was not. Further adjustment for health, socioeconomic and behavioural covariates made little difference. Analyses based on height categories showed similar trends. Conclusion: Adult height has a positive association with mental health as measured by the SF-6D among ethnic Chinese in Singapore. Socioeconomic status and known physical health problems do not explain this association. Adult height had no association with SF-6D utility index scores.

AB We investigated the associations between negative life events, social support, depressive and hostile symptoms, and suicide risk according to gender in multinational Asian patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). A total of 547 outpatients with MDD (352 women and 195 men, mean age of 39.58 +/- 13.21 years) were recruited in China, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Taiwan. All patients were assessed with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, the Symptoms Checklist 90-Revised, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, and the List of Threatening Experiences. Negative life events, social support, depressive symptoms, and hostility were all significantly associated with suicidality in female MDD patients. However, only depressive symptoms and hostility were significantly associated with suicidality in male patients. Depression severity and hostility only partially mediated the association of negative life events and poor social support with suicidality in female patients. In contrast, hostility fully mediated the association of negative life events and poor social support with suicidality in male patients. Our results highlight the need of in-depth assessment of suicide risk for depressed female patients who report a number of negative life events and poor social supports, even if they do not show severe psychopathology.

TI Assessing the terrorist threat to Singapore's land transportation
   infrastructure
SO JOURNAL OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE land transportation; threat; terrorist; Jemaah Islamiyah; MRT; bombing
AB The highly lethal attacks against land transportation targets in Madrid and London have sparked considerable amount of debate in Singapore about the terrorist threat to the local land transportation infrastructure. How real is this threat and what can be done to counter it? This is the central question addressed in this paper.
   While transportation targets in general have always been a terrorist favorite, in recent years there has been an increased emphasis on attacking soft transportation targets such as mass transit. There are several distinct reasons for this development, including the increasing difficulty of successfully striking other targets, the ease of producing large number of casualties, the panic-spreading universality of the city bus or metro car, economic impact on the afflicted state by crippling workforce mobility and deterring foreign investment and tourism, symbolic value, and an overall high probability of success and a low level of risk. Indeed, since 1991 more than 42 percent of terrorist strikes worldwide were directed specifically against land transportation, producing the highest casualty rates of any type of terrorist attack.
   With regards to the threat to Singapore's transit system, analysis of Jemaah Islamiya's ideology and targeting patterns reveals an increasing preference for soft, Western, mass-casualty targets in Southeast Asia. But while Singapore's commuter transportation system fully encompasses all of these adjectives, the recently weakened Jemaah Islamiya currently possesses only very limited capability to strike this type of target with significant results. Still, other adjacent threats exist including a possible attack by a home-grown terror cell, attempted suicides by deranged individuals, or the disruption of service via a wave of hoaxes by pranksters or terrorist group sympathizers.
   Despite the relatively low level of threat, Singapore has made many preparations and preventive measures that other countries that have experienced surface transportation terrorism have identified as pillars of effective public transportation security. These essentially include prevention, effective response and timely mitigation, and psychological defence measures.

TI Homicidal and dyadic falls from a height: Rarities in Singapore
SO MEDICINE SCIENCE AND THE LAW

DT Article
ID FATAL FALLS; SUICIDE; INJURIES; DEATH
AB A review of homicidal falls from a height, over a ten-year-period (1991-2000), demonstrated the rarity of such deaths in Singapore, despite the high frequency of fatal falls from a height that prevails in the city-state. During that time, there were four cases (involving five individuals) of pure homicide and nine episodes (involving 19 individuals) of dyadic death involving vertical deceleration from a considerable height in the approximate range of 17-31 m (6-11 floors) and 17-50 m (6-18 floors), respectively. The index cases were gleaned from a total of 533 homicides and 3,963 fatal falls from a height. Hence, the corresponding ten-year prevalence rates of homicidal falls were 0.9% in terms of all homicidal deaths and 0.1% in relation to all fatal falls, and 3.6% and 0.5% for dyadic falls, respectively.
   The majority of victims were children, with almost equal numbers of males and females, aged between two months and six years for pure homicides and between 20 months and 13 years for homicide-suicides. Over a third (9/24) of these subjects attained the maximum Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 75. With respect to the dyadic deaths, the majority of the perpetrators (6/9) were females, comprising four mothers and two live-in maids. It would appear that strained or broken relationships, probable or actual mental illness, or a combination of both factors, had largely predisposed them to these tragic events which may, potentially, carry diplomatic implications when foreign nationals are involved.

AB Background: Depressive disorder is treatable but costly, thus influencing quality of life of people. Aim: Determine direct and indirect costs incurred by depressive disorder in Singapore. Methods: A 1-year prospective naturalistic study was conducted in a university mood disorder center between 2007 and 2008. Patients with primary International Classification of Disease-10 diagnosis of depressive disorder were recruited. Disease costs between mild, moderate and severe depression, and cost predictors were analyzed and determined. Results: Forty nine patients completed the study. Mean annual total costs per patient were US$7638. Indirect costs (81%) dominated the total costs. Approximately 50% of indirect costs were associated with loss of productivity and unemployment. Higher education level, higher mean Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score and number of suicide attempts were independent variables associated with increased direct costs while mean Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scale score was an independent variable for indirect costs. Conclusion: Medical cost saving strategies should focus on indirect costs.

AB Within a two-year period between 2009 and 2010, the Forensic Medicine Division of the Health Sciences Authority conducted a total of 3560 autopsies on cases reported to the coroner. This retrospective study reviews the type and distribution of these cases, and serves as a pilot study for future analysis of the various subgroups. Nearly half of these deaths (48.93%) are a result of natural disease processes, of which a cardiac cause by far predominates (64.64%), followed by diseases of the respiratory (16.92%) and central nervous (5.28%) systems. Of the deaths by unnatural means (51.07%), a substantial number of these deaths are consequent to fall from height, i.e. off a building (35.86%), with a smaller proportion of death arising from traffic and industrial accidents (17.60%), asphyxia (14.25%) and short distance falls (11.00%). Fall from height is the leading mode of suicide in this densely populated urban city where 85% of the population reside in high-rise apartments.

ID POLITICS
AB In 1900, in the British colony of Singapore, a Siamese man, Manit, shot his beloved British wife, Maude, and allegedly attempted suicide. Several competing interpretations of the incident exist. In one, Manit is considered a deranged and treacherous fraud; in another, he is a pitiable cuckold; in the third, he is a respectable gentleman suffering from unrequited love. Surprisingly, given the racialized context of high imperialism in Southeast Asia, the British in Singapore came to empathize with the Asian Manit as a lovelorn gentleman and to disavow their own countrywoman. The court ultimately acquitted him of any wrongdoing. This article considers the competing interpretations and explains why a seemingly race-blind one prevailed. It reviews genealogical records, personal letters, newspaper accounts of court proceedings, and internal Thai government internal records, which provide unusually rich documentation of a romance that crossed national, cultural, and racial boundaries and created surprising transnational affiliations based on emotional empathy. Maude and Manit's relationship and court case provide a captivating glimpse into the sentimental, dramatic, and sometimes brutal details of daily life; the emotional and subjective aspects of history that are often discarded as mere embellishment to more 'substantive' histories focused squarely on political and economic power. However, it is precisely the emotive aspects of their relationship and their interpretation that highlight the existence of a transnational, transracial alliance between Manit and British elites in Singapore, based on shared notions of upper class masculinity, common educational experiences, and a mutual spatial and power relationship with the imperial metropole in London. The case cuts across racial divisions and highlights a transracial emotional style. Approaching history through a study of emotional discourse sheds light on a broader racial, sexual, and gendered organization of power in late colonial Southeast Asia.

AB INTRODUCTION Deliberate self-harm (DSH) is frequently seen in adolescents with a range of mental health problems. The prevalence and features of DSH vary among different countries and settings. This study examines the prevalence of self-harm in a sample of adolescents seen at a psychiatric outpatient clinic in Singapore.
   METHODS Information regarding self-harm, as well as its associated demographic and clinical risk factors, was extracted from the clinical records of 542 consecutive, new patients, aged 12-19 years, who presented between 2006 and 2010.
   RESULTS DSH was reported in 23.6% of patients, and was positively associated with the female gender (odds ratio [OR] 4.54), mood disorders (OR 4.58), adjustment disorders (OR 3.41) and regular alcohol use (OR 4.80). However, there was no association with parental marital status, anxiety disorder, habitual smoking or family history of psychiatric illness.
   CONCLUSION DSH is a significant clinical problem that may be influenced by biological and clinical factors. Adolescents presenting with DSH should be examined for mood and alcohol use disorders.

AB Background: Deliberate self-harm (DSH) is a prominent mental health concern among adolescents. Few studies have examined adolescent DSH in non-Western countries. This study examines the prevalence, types and associated risk factors of DSH in a clinical sample of adolescents in Singapore.
   Methods: Using a retrospective review of medical records, demographic and clinical data were obtained from 398 consecutive adolescent psychiatric outpatients (mean age = 17.5 +/- 1.4 years, range = 13-19 years) who presented at Changi General Hospital from 2013 to 2015.
   Results: 23.1% (n = 92) of adolescents engaged in at least one type of DSH. Cutting was the most common type of DSH reported. Females were three times more likely to engage in DSH than males. DSH was positively associated with female gender (odds ratio [OR] 5.03), depressive disorders (OR 2.45), alcohol use (OR 3.49) and forensic history (OR 3.66), but not with smoking behaviour, living arrangement, parental marital status, past abuse or family history of psychiatric illness.
   Conclusion: Interventions targeting adolescent DSH should also alleviate depressive symptoms, alcohol use and delinquent behaviours.

AB INTRODUCTION In Singapore, as strict laws are a strong deterrent against armed violence, little is known about the epidemiology of penetrating stab wound injuries. Our study aimed to investigate the epidemiology of stab wound injuries at a major trauma centre in Singapore and determine if there was a difference in severity between self-inflicted stab wound (SI) injuries and those inflicted by others (IO).
   METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all penetrating injuries at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, and identified and categorised all stab wound injuries as SI or IO. Basic demographic information, injury severity characteristics and outcome data were compared between these two groups. A review of all mortalities was performed, including recording the causes of death.
   RESULTS Between 2005 and 2010, there were a total of 149 stab wound injuries, of which 24 (16.1%) were SI and 125 (83.9%) were IO injuries. Patients tended to be young (mean age 34.1 +/- 14.2 years). The mean Injury Severity Score was significantly different between the SI and IO groups (8.8 +/- 6.5 vs. 12.3 +/- 8.1; p = 0.03). In both groups, the majority underwent an operative procedure (83.3% vs. 85.6%) and had an average hospital stay of four days.
   CONCLUSION The study confirms our hypothesis that SI injuries tend to be less severe than IO injuries and are more likely to occur at home rather than at a public area. This finding may be useful in the triage of patients with stab wound injuries.

AB Introduction Little is known about the prescription patterns of adjunctive antidepressants in Asian schizophrenia patients. This study aimed to examine trends in the use of antidepressants and their demographic and clinical correlates in the treatment of schizophrenia in Asia between 2001 and 2009. Methods A total of 6,761 hospitalized schizophrenia patients in nine Asian countries and territories were examined: 2,399 in 2001, 2,136 in 2004 and 2,226 in 2009. Patients' socio-demographic and clinical characteristics and prescriptions of psychotropic drugs were recorded using a standardized protocol and data collection procedure. Results The proportion of antidepressant prescription was 6.8% in the whole sample; 5.3% in 2001, 6.5% in 2004 and 8.7% in 2009. There were wide inter-country variations at each survey ranging from 0.9% in Hong Kong to 15.3% in Singapore in 2001; from 1.9% in Korea to 15.4% in Singapore in 2004; and from 2.7% in Japan to 22.0% in Singapore in 2009. Multiple logistic regression analysis of the whole sample revealed that patients on antidepressants were younger, more likely to receive benzodiazepines and have significant extrapyramidal side-effects and less likely to have significant positive symptoms. Discussion Unlike findings in Western countries, adjunctive antidepressant prescription for schizophrenia was not common in Asia. The frequency of antidepressant prescription varied among countries and territories, suggesting that a host of clinical and socio-cultural factors played a role in determining antidepressant use in Asia.

AB Background: East Asian countries have high suicide rates. However, little is known about clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with suicidality in Asian populations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors associated with suicidality in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) from six Asian countries.
   Methods: The study cohort consisted of 547 outpatients with MDD. Patients presented to study sites in China (n = 114), South Korea (n = 101), Malaysia (n = 90), Singapore (n = 40), Thailand (n = 103), and Taiwan (n = 99). All patients completed the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the Global Severity Index(SCL-90R), the Fatigue Severity Scale, the 36-item short-form health survey, the Sheehan Disability Scale, and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). Patients were classified as showing high suicidality if they scored >= 6 on the MINI suicidality module. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to examine sociodemographic and clinical factors related to high suicidality.
   Results: One hundred and twenty-five patients were classed as high suicidality. Unemployed status (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.43, p < 0.01), MADRS score (adjusted OR 1.08), p < 0.001, and GSI (SCL-90R) score (adjusted OR 1.06, p < 0.01) were positively related to high suicidality. Hindu (adjusted OR 0.09, p < 0.05) or Muslim (adjusted OR 0.21, p < 0.001) religion and MSPSS score (adjusted OR 0.82, p < 0.05) were protective against high suicidality.
   Conclusions: A variety of sociodemographic and clinical factors were associated with high suicidality in Asian patients with MDD. These factors may facilitate the identification of MDD patients at risk of suicide.

AB The rise in psychological problems, attrition, and suicide rates of university students has been linked to the stressful challenges faced during university life. To buffer this, animal assisted activities (AAA) may assist in improving psychological and physiological well-being in students, however, to date, there is little empirical evidence for their effectiveness. Consequently, this study explored the psychological and physiological benefits of AAA in a sample of undergraduate students. Sixty-two students from two local universities participated in an hour-long AAA session delivered by Therapy Dogs Singapore. Measures of perceived stress, anxiety, state self-esteem, and blood pressure (BP) were taken before and after the sessions. The results indicated that students experienced significant decreases in state anxiety, systolic, and diastolic BP post AAA, and when compared to a quiet reading comparison session. State self-esteem increased post AAA and, further, was found to moderate the change in anxiety in addition to perceived stress, whereby perceived anxiety reduced more in those with low state self-esteem and high perceived stress. These results suggest that AAA can be an effective intervention for stress among undergraduate students, which utilizes a novel, easy to implement and enjoyable approach for Singaporean students.

AB Introduction: The main aim of the study was to identify the prevalence of deliberate self-harm (DSH) in a sample of youth outpatients attending the state psychiatric hospital in Singapore and to identify the sociodemographic and psychological/clinical risk factors associated with DSH. The secondary aim of the study was to examine if different forms of DSH had distinguishing risk factors. Materials and Methods: A total of 400 outpatients at the Institute of Mental Health completed a self-report survey comprising sociodemographic questions, the FunctionalAssessment of Self-Mutilation, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Parental Bonding Instrument and the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale. Logistic regression models were used to test the associations. Results: The overall prevalence of DSH in our clinical population was 58.8%. Cutting/carving (25.4%) and hitting (20.4%) were the most common forms of DSH in the past 12 months. DSH acts were performed primarily for emotion regulation purposes. The risk factors for DSH in general were younger age group, female gender, abuse history and higher depression scores. Gender and age group were the factors that were differentially associated with cutting and hitting one's self. Conclusion: There was a high prevalence of DSH in the psychiatric outpatient population. The risk factors identified in this study are consistent with those of international studies which point to their stability across cultures.

AB We report the case of a 29-year-old mixed-race woman suffering from recurrent major depressive episodes, with suicidal ideation and risk, involving several inpatient admissions. A comorbid diagnosis of borderline personality disorder was also recorded in one of her previous inpatient admissions. During her last inpatient admission, a multidisciplinary case discussion and review of the patient's life highlighted several possible intercultural trigger factors that could have contributed to the exacerbation of her psychiatric illness. We emphasise the need to explore intercultural predisposing and precipitating factors for a more complete psychodynamic understanding of psychiatric illnesses among the multiracial population of Singapore. This also adds to the discussion on the management of such patients with the option of formal in-depth psychotherapy in adjunct to medication. This may prevent recurrent relapses, modify suicide intent and reduce the necessity for inpatient treatment, which will be cost-effective and result in efficacious treatment.

AB This study investigated the effect of gender and parents' marital status on adolescents suicidal ideation in a sample of Grade 8 and Grade 9 students (mean age = 14.12 years) in Singapore. Two hundred and seventy-one (149 boys and 122 girls) students completed the junior high school version of the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire (SIQ-JR) and a short demographic questionnaire. Consistent with our hypothesis, the 2 (Gender) x 2 (Parents' marital status) ANOVA yielded a statistically significant interaction effect as expected. Specifically, tests of simple effects reveal that adolescent boys from single-parent families were found to be significantly higher on suicidal ideation compared with adolescent boys from two-parent families. This difference was not found among adolescent girls adolescent girls from single-parent and two-parent families did not differ significantly on suicidal ideation. Being a boy in a single-parent home environment may increase one's risk for endorsing clinically significant suicidal ideation.

DE adolescent; psychosexual behaviour; sexual behaviour; sexual health
AB In the complex developmental period of puberty, adolescents experience biophysical changes and adapt to societal and cultural expectations of adulthood. Development of their sexuality is an important biopsychosocial change during this period that, when neglected, may result in unmet sexual and reproductive health needs. Patterns of behaviour in adolescence have repercussions across the lifespan. HEADSSS (home, education/employment/eating, activities, drugs, sexuality, sleep, suicide/depression and safety) is a systematic clinical screening tool for use with adolescents. Adolescents may view risk-seeking lifestyle patterns as appropriate behaviours, and physicians can help them recognise the risks and develop less harmful alternatives and strategies. Personal biases should not affect healthcare providers' duty to respect the rights of adolescents and ability to provide developmentally appropriate care. Healthcare professionals should be familiar with the relevant legal statutes in Singapore and refer suspected sexual abuse or violence, risk of self-harm, teenage pregnancy, newly diagnosed sexual transmitted infections or multiple risk-seeking behaviours for further evaluation and help.

AB Relations among academic stress, depression, and suicidal ideation were examined in 1,108 Asian adolescents 12-18 years old from a secondary school in Singapore. Using Baron and Kenny's [J Pers, Soc Psychol 51:1173-1192, 19861 framework, this study tested the prediction that adolescent depression mediated the relationship between academic stress and suicidal ideation in a four-step process. The previously significant relationship between academic stress and suicidal ideation was significantly reduced in magnitude when depression was included in the model providing evidence in this sample that adolescent depression was a partial mediator. The applied and practical implications for intervention and prevention work in schools are discussed. The present investigation, also served as a demonstration to illustrate how multiple regression analyses can be used as one possible method for testing mediation effects within child psychology and psychiatry.

AB The application of continuous deep sedation (CDS) in the treatment of intractable suffering at the end of life continues to be tied to a number of concerns that have negated its use in palliative care. Part of the resistance towards use of this treatment option of last resort has been the continued association of CDS with physician-associated suicide and/or euthanasia (PAS/E), which is compounded by a lack clinical guidelines and a failure to cite this treatment under the aegis of a palliative care approach. I argue that reinstituting a palliative care-inspired approach that includes a holistic review of the patient's situation and the engagement of a multidisciplinary team (MDT) guided by clearly defined practice requirements that have been lacking amongst many prevailing guidelines will overcome prevailing objections to this practice and allow for the legitimization of this process.

AB This paper sketches some conceptual tools by which Cultural geographers might advance geographies of architecture. It does so by thinking specifically about one architectural form: the modernist residential highrise, which is the 'big thing' of this paper. The paper draws on recent developments in material semiotics in order to interrogate features often uniquely associated with the highrise, such as its global reach, uniformity, and scale. The paper first rethinks how Cultural geography has traditionally explained the movement Of built forms, explicitly turning from diffusionist accounts to the notion of translation. it then offers a reconsideration of the way geographers might think about scale in relation to a 'big' and 'global' thing like the modernist highrise, arguing that scale is produced relationally and in specific contexts. Finally, it offers a template for cultural geographical scholarship which takes seriously the technical work entailed in things, like a highrise, materialising or de-materializing. It does so by way Of two illustrative stories: One about the Productive social science of highrise suicides in Singapore; the other about the destructive role of the inquiry into collapse of Ronan point in the UK.

TI Managing burn victims of suicide bombing attacks: outcomes, lessons
   learnt, and changes made from three attacks in Indonesia
SO CRITICAL CARE
LA English
DT Article
ID EXTERNAL SIGNS; INJURIES; MANAGEMENT; ISRAEL
AB Introduction Terror attacks in Southeast Asia were almost nonexistent until the 2002 Bali bomb blast, considered the deadliest attack in Indonesian history. Further attacks in 2003 ( Jakarta), 2004 ( Jakarta), and 2005 ( Bali) have turned terrorist attacks into an ever-present reality.
   Methods The authors reviewed medical charts of victims evacuated to the Singapore General Hospital ( SGH) Burns Centre during three suicide attacks involving Bali ( 2002 and 2005) and the Jakarta Marriott hotel ( 2003). Problems faced, lessons learnt, and costs incurred are discussed. A burns disaster plan drawing on lessons learnt from these attacks is presented.
   Results Thirty-one patients were treated at the SGH Burns Centre in three attacks ( 2002 Bali attack [ n = 15], 2003 Jakarta attack [ n = 14], and 2005 Bali attack [ n = 2]). For the 2002 Bali attack, median age was 29 years ( range 20 to 50 years), median percentage of total burn surface area ( TBSA) was 29% ( range 5% to 55%), and median abbreviated burn severity index ( ABSI) was 6 ( range 3 to 10). Eight of 15 patients were admitted to the intensive care unit. For the 2003 Jakarta attack, median age was 35 years ( range 24 to 56 years), median percentage of TBSA was 10% ( range 2% to 46%), and median ABSI was 4 ( range 3 to 9). A large number of patients had other injuries. Problems faced included manpower issues, lack of bed space, shortage of blood products, and lack of cadaver skin.
   Conclusion The changing nature of terror attacks mandates continued vigilance and disaster preparedness. The multidimensional burns patient, complicated by other injuries, is likely to become increasingly common. A burns disaster plan with emphasis on effective command, control, and communication as well as organisation of health care personnel following a 'team concept' will do much to ensure that the sudden onset of a crisis situation at an unexpected time does not overwhelm hospital manpower and resources.

   REMISSION; GUIDELINES; PREDICTORS; SUICIDE; RISK
AB Objective: Early symptomatic response is pertinent in improving outcomes in first-episode psychosis. One of the ways in which this may be achieved is by reducing inappropriate delays in clozapine initiation. This study aimed to examine clozapine prescribing practices among clinicians by establishing the prevalence of clozapine use, identifying baseline clinical and demographic factors that were associated with clozapine use, examining outcomes in clozapine users versus nonusers, and identifying inappropriate antipsychotic prescription patterns prior to clozapine initiation.
   Methods: A retrospective study including all consecutive patients who had presented to the Singapore Early Psychosis Intervention Programme (EPIP) from April 2001 to June 2012 was conducted. Clinical and demographic data were extracted from the EPIP database. Incident cases of clozapine users were identified, and additional treatment histories were obtained from medical records. In addition to descriptive statistics, multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors associated with clozapine initiation.
   Results: Data from 1,603 patients were available for baseline analyses. Of these, 69 patients (4.3%) had been prescribed clozapine. Having a younger age at onset, lack of employment, a lower Global Assessment of Functioning disability score, and a higher Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score at baseline were factors associated with clozapine use. After adjustment was made for confounders, clozapine users were found to have attained similar rates of remission and recovery as patients who did not use clozapine. Clozapine initiation was delayed by a mean of 19.3 weeks (SD = 27.1; range, 0-117). Prior to commencing clozapine, 29.4% of patients had received antipsychotic treatments above maximum limits, whereas 75% of patients were prescribed >= 3 different antipsychotics (median = 3; range, 2-7).
   Conclusions: This study has confirmed that the prescribing of clozapine is low, delayed, and preceded by dosing of antipsychotic drugs above maximum limits. Identification of the factors found to be associated with clozapine use may encourage clinicians to consider clozapine sooner in relevant patients in hopes of achieving early symptomatic response.

   PREGNANCY
AB Introduction: In Singapore, published maternal mortality rates (MMR) over the last decade (1990 to 1999) have been so low (0.0 to 1.0 per 1000 live births and still births) as to imply that maternal deaths are rare to the point of being non-existent in some years. This inference is counterintuitive, and earlier studies on maternal mortality, amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) and pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) have also suggested otherwise. Accordingly, local trends in maternal mortality warrant further examination. Materials and Methods: A descriptive and comparative study, comprising a clinico-pathological review of maternal deaths,for which autopsies were conducted by the Centre for Forensic Medicine, during a 10-year period from 1990 to 1999. The annual necropsy-based, MMR (estimated MMR), as well as the prevalence of maternal deaths during this time, were estimated with the aid of the relevant, published demographic data on live births and still births. These were compared with the corresponding rates calculated (calculated, MMR) from raw demographic data on maternal deaths classified as such in the published data. Results: Coronial autopsies were conducted on a total of 51 cases of maternal death, of which 33, 17 and I were direct, indirect and fortuitous deaths, respectively. The annual, estimated MMR ranged from 0.4 to 1.8 per 10,000 live births and still births. The estimated MMR was twice as high as the calculated MMR and a statistically significant upward linear trend was demonstrated for the former (P = 0.046). AFE (16151) and PTE (10151) were the two most common causes of maternal death; their corresponding cause-specific, 10-year prevalence being 0.33 and 0.21 per 10,000 live births and stillbirths, respectively. There was apparent clustering of the cases of PTE during the earlier part of the last decade (1990 to 1995), corresponding to a statistical l, significant, upward trend in its overall necropsy incidence during that time (P = 0.019). Cardiovascular and pulmonary disorders constituted the bulk of indirect deaths (13/17), while antenatal suicides accounted for 3 of these deaths (0.06 per 10,000 live births and still births). Conclusions: This was an upward trend in MMR, as reflected in coronial casework, over the last decade. It would appear that the local, estimated (direct and indirect) maternal mortality prevalence compares favourably with the MMR reported in developed countries. The apparent rate of AFE was no less than 4 times higher than that reported in the United Kingdom, while the maternal mortality rate from PTE was at least as high. Allowing for the possibility that such deaths were under-reported, the actual annual MMR and 10-year prevalence could be appreciably, higher than the estimates presented here. There in ay well be a case for the establishment of a comprehensive database of maternal deaths, that is updated continually and contemporaneously, in Singapore.

AB Objectives: Subsyndromal depression (SSD) and subsyndromal anxiety (SSA) are common in the elderly and if left untreated, contributes to a lower quality of life, increased suicide risk, disability and inappropriate use of medical services. Innovative approaches are necessary to address this public health concern. We evaluate a community-based psychosocial intervention program and its effect on mental health outcomes in Singaporean older adults.
   Method:Elderly participants with SSD and SSA, as assessed on the Geriatric Depression Scale and Geriatric Anxiety Inventory, were included. Intervention groups include Tai Chi exercise, Art Therapy, Mindfulness Awareness Practice and Music Reminiscence Therapy. The program was divided into a single intervention phase and a combination intervention phase. Outcomes were measured with the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) at baseline, 4 weeks, 10 weeks, 24 weeks and 52 weeks. The program had ethics board approval.
   Results: A hundred and one subjects (25 males, 76 females; mean age = 71 years, SD = 5.95) participated. There were significant reductions in SDS and SAS scores in the single intervention phase (P < 0.05), and these reductions remained significant at week 52, after completion of the combination intervention phase, relative to baseline (P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Participating in these psychosocial interventions led to a positive improvement in SSD and SSA symptoms in these elderly subjects over a year. This simple, inexpensive and culturally acceptable approach should be adequately studied and replicated in other communities.

AB Introduction Behaviour disturbances in preadolescent children are common, ranging from mild disturbances to full disorders meeting official nosological criterion. The objective of this paper was tore view behavioural disorders occurring in the preadolescent child using up to-date published data supplemented by available local published data on the subject. Methods Recent reviews of the various psychological disorders in childhood that have a significant behavioural component were identified through a MEDLINE search (from 1990). Information from these reviews was supplemented with relevant local studies cited on MEDLINE from 1990. Information on common behavioural disturbances facing parents locally was obtained from questions submitted to the author over a 3-year period by a local parenting magazine. A search was also conducted on the DOW JONES publications archives for relevant information from the local news media. Results: The perception of a problem may arise form the child, family, school, community or society's perspective. Behavioural problems can be conceptualised to exist in the following broad categories: Behaviour problems/disorders related to daily physiological activities; disruptive behavioural problems and disorders; pervasive developmental disorders and disorders of social behaviour, behaviour problems related to emotional disorders; and behaviour problems associated with other mental conditions in children. Family, behavioural and multisystemic interventions are the commonest non-drug interventions. Drug use is on the increase, especially in disruptive, affective and anxiety disorders. Conclusions: Behavioural disorders in children are common. They are often under-recognised and under-treated. Improved recognition demands that a good assessment is being carried out and a heightened index of suspicion for the commoner behavioural disorders. Adopting an evidence-based medicine approach and utilising recent advances in psychopharmacology and psychotherapy may improve outcome.

AB IntroductionThis study was to assess differences in the symptom profile of depressive illness across various countries/territories in Asia. The study was a part of the Research on Asia Psychotropic Prescription project. The participating countries/territories include China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand.
   MethodsThe pattern of depressive symptoms in 1,400 subjects with depressive disorder from 42 psychiatric centers in 10 Asian countries/territories was assessed. We collected information on socio-demographic and clinical characteristics with a standardized protocol and data collection procedure.
   ResultsThe most common presentations of depressive symptoms were persistent sadness, loss of interest, and insomnia. Similar findings were found regardless of the region, country, or its income level. Patients with depressive disorder from high-income countries presented significantly more with vegetative symptom cluster (P<0.05), while those from the upper middle-income countries had significantly more with both mood (P<0.001) and cognitive symptom clusters (P<0.01). In lower middle-income countries, patients with depressive symptoms had significantly less mood symptom cluster (P<0.001) but significantly more cognitive symptom cluster (P<0.05).
   DiscussionThis study demonstrates that in Asia, despite variations in the initial symptom reported by the patients, across different countries/territories, core depressive symptoms remain the same. Variations have been found in presentation of depressive symptoms with regards to the level of income of countries. Physical or vegetative symptoms were reported more by centers in higher income countries, while depressive cognition and suicidal thoughts/acts were more frequently reported from lower income countries.

ID COMORBIDITY
AB Introduction: Bipolar disorder, or manic depressive psychosis, is a psychiatric disorder characterised by extreme changes in mood, thinking, energy and behaviour. Western studies on this condition show a delay in diagnosis and treatment. The aim of this study is to examine the demographical profile and clinical features of this group of patients in Singapore to see if there is a similar delay.
   Methods: Data of patients diagnosed with this condition and treated in two separate outpatient practices in the private sector from January 1999 to October 2003 were retrieved from case files and analysed.
   Results: Of the 121 patients with bipolar disorder treated, there were 45 percent male and SS percent female patients, and most of them were in the 20-39 year age group. Chinese formed the largest ethnic group while Malays were under-represented. 58 percent were employed, and 48 percent were married. While the age of onset of illness ranged mainly from age 10 to 29 years, the age when they first sought treatment was from 20 to 39 years. A duration of illness of more than two years was found in 79 percent of these patients. In terms of diagnostic categories, 17 percent were bipolar 1, 76 percent were bipolar I I and 7 percent of the bipolar disorders, not otherwise specified. The first episode presented was depression in 75 percent and bipolar disorder was the initial diagnosis in only 34 percent of the cases. A delay in the correct diagnosis for more than two years accounted for 34 percent of the cases. Only 17 percent had a family history of bipolar disorder. 28 percent had a history of antidepressant-induced manic episodes and 17 percent had a previous episode of mixed state. Psychotic symptoms were absent in 75 percent, and 65 percent had never been hospitalised for their condition. Nine percent had made a past suicide attempt and 39 percent had a comorbid diagnosis. 46 percent were treated with a combination of mood stabilisers, neuroleptics and antidepressants and 16 percent had electroconvulsive therapy. Only 34 percent were in full remission of their illness.
   Conclusion: There was a preponderance towards the younger age groups for the age of onset, and the type of first episode was typically depression. There was a significant delay in diagnosis and treatment of patients with bipolar disorder. These features were strikingly similar to Western studies. Bipolar 11 was the diagnostic category seen more than bipolar I in the outpatient setting. Polypharmacy was the norm and a large group of patients did not achieve full remission.

AB Objective: To investigate associations between sleep duration and health-related measures, and factors associated with short sleep, in adolescents in an East Asian society with strong emphasis on academic achievement.
   Methods: Adolescents aged 13-19 years (n = 2346) from eight schools in Singapore (five local, three international) took part in a cross-sectional survey of sleep habits, school life, and health. Self-rated health, overweight (International Obesity Task Force Criteria), and depression symptoms were compared in adolescents with short (< 7 h), moderately short (7 to < 8 h), or an appropriate amount of sleep (8-10 h) on school nights.
   Results: Short sleep on school nights was associated with poorer self-rated health, increased odds of being overweight (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj] = 2.56, 95% confidence interval = 1.39-4.70), and increased odds of feeling depression symptoms (sadness, irritability, worthlessness, low motivation, difficulty concentrating, anhedonia, anxiety, and thoughts of self-harm/suicide) compared with an appropriate sleep duration (ORadj = 2.10-4.33, p < 0.05 for each symptom). Barriers to healthy sleep included later preferred sleep timing (a relative indicator of later chronotype), lower parental supervision of bedtime, longer study time, early school start time, and longer travel time. Students at local schools were less likely to have a parent-set bedtime, and spent more time on homework/studying. Later bedtime in local schools attenuated the benefit of later school start time on nocturnal sleep duration.
   Conclusions: Short sleep may contribute to poorer adolescent health and well-being. Strategies for improving sleep in hard-driving East Asian societies should take into account sociocultural factors that may impede removal of barriers to healthy sleep. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Acinetobacter baumannii is an important nosocomial pathogen that has become increasingly resistant to multiple antibiotics. Genetic manipulation of MDR A. baumannii is useful especially for defining the contribution of each active efflux mechanism in multidrug resistance. Existing methods rely on the use of an antibiotic selection marker and are not suited for multiple gene deletions.
   Results: A tellurite-resistant (sacB(+), xylE(+)) suicide vector, pMo130-Tel(R), was created for deleting the adeFGH and adeIJK operons in two clinical MDR A. baumannii, DB and R2 from Singapore. Using a two-step selection, plasmid insertion recombinants (first-crossover) were selected for tellurite resistance and the deletion mutants (second-crossover) were then selected for loss of sacB. The DNA deletions were verified by PCR while loss of gene expression in the Delta adeFGH, Delta adeIJK and Delta adeFGH Delta adeIJK deletion mutants was confirmed using qRT-PCR. The contribution of AdeFGH and AdeIJK pumps to MDR was defined by comparing antimicrobial susceptibilities of the isogenic mutants and the parental strains. The deletion of adeIJK produced no more than eight-fold increase in susceptibility to nalidixic acid, tetracycline, minocycline, tigecycline, clindamycin, trimethoprim and chloramphenicol, while the deletion of adeL-adeFGH operon alone had no impact on antimicrobial susceptibility. Dye accumulation assays using H33342 revealed increased dye retention in all deletion mutants, except for the R2 Delta adeFGH mutant, where a decrease was observed. Increased accumulation of ethidium bromide was observed in the parental strains and all pump deletion mutants in the presence of efflux inhibitors. The efflux pump deletion mutants in this study revealed that only the AdeIJK, but not the AdeFGH RND pump, contributes to antimicrobial resistance and dye accumulation in MDR A. baumannii DB and R2.
   Conclusions: The marker-less gene deletion method using pMo130-Tel(R) is applicable for creating single and multiple gene deletions in MDR A. baumannii. The adeFGH and adeIJK operons were successfully deleted separately and together using this method and the impact of each efflux pump on antimicrobial resistance could be defined clearly.

AB Varenicline is an orally administered small molecule with partial agonist activity at the alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Varenicline was approved by both the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency of the EU in 2006 as an aid to smoking cessation. Subsequently, varenicline has been approved in over 80 other countries.
   Varenicline is almost entirely absorbed following oral administration, and absorption is unaffected by food, smoking or the time of day. Varenicline undergoes only minimal metabolism and approximately 90% of the drug is excreted in the urine unchanged. Varenicline has a mean elimination half-life after repeated administration of approximately 24 hours in smokers. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve is increased in patients with moderate or severe renal failure. No clinically relevant varenicline-drug interactions have been identified.
   In two identical, randomized, double-blind, phase III clinical trials in healthy, motivated-to-quit, mainly Caucasian smokers aged 18-75 years in the US, 12 weeks of treatment with varenicline I mg twice daily was associated with significantly higher abstinence rates over weeks 9-12 than sustained-release bupropion 150mg twice daily or placebo. In a separate phase III trial, an additional 12 weeks of treatment in smokers achieving abstinence in the first 12 weeks was associated with greater abstinence through to week 52 than placebo treatment. Varenicline treatment was also associated with significantly higher rates of abstinence than placebo treatment in randomized, double-blind, clinical trials in smokers in China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. In a randomized, open-label, multi-national, phase III trial, varenicline treatment was associated with a significantly higher rate of abstinence than transdermal nicotine-replacement therapy. In these trials, varenicline treatment was associated with lower urge to smoke and satisfaction from smoking in relapsers than placebo or active comparators.
   In the two US phase III trials, 12 weeks of treatment with varenicline I mg twice daily had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. Nausea and abnormal dreams were the most common adverse events that occurred in more varenicline than placebo recipients. The incidence and prevalence of nausea were greatest in weeks I and 2 of treatment, and declined thereafter. The prevalence of early adverse effects can be reduced by individual dose titration. Adverse events associated with varenicline therapy have been reported in post-marketing surveillance, including neuropsychiatric events such as depressed mood, agitation, changes in behaviour, suicidal ideation and suicide. Currently, it is unclear whether the association of varenicline therapy with these adverse events is causal, coincidental or related to smoking cessation.
   Given the greater efficacy of varenicline compared with other pharmacotherapies, and the high risk of morbidity and mortality associated with continued smoking, varenicline is a valuable pharmacological aid to smoking cessation.
